0,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93635-jason-etc,1,"This probably would've been a much more impressive book if I didn't have a background in molecular and cell biology. I'm not saying that science can't be tied to the power of positive thinking, but his conclusions require enormous leaps in order to tie one to the other. Some of the experimental results he points to are incredibly weak and superficial (DNA methylation rates) and his attempt to involve quantum mechanics by including it in a later chapter like an afterthought in order (I guess) to make everything seem deeper and more metaphysical was a ridiculously poor choice. Quantum theory isn't something that anyone should attempt to wrap their hypothesis in just because it sounds convincing. Done wrong, it's actually a shortcut to losing credibility.And as for epigenetics, there's nothing 'new' about the science. The processes involved in controlling gene expression are ridiculously complicated. Implying that positive thought can alter cell membrane structure and through that alteration, effect DNA transcription/translation in a way favorable to cell survival or death (depending on the circumstances) has the potential of leading to truly ignorant and insensitive statements like, 'Well, that person died because they didn't think positively enough'. Like I said, I'm not saying that there isn't a connection between science and belief. I'm saying that this book fails to make it."

It starts up with an in-depth look at how perception alters the response of cells. It discusses epigenetics, and how proteins really contain the ""secret of life"", and not DNA itself. So far, so good.The author then tries to make a parallel between cellular perception and an organism's sense of perception. He describes ways in which perception and beliefs can alter one's biological functions. For example, stress can impair the immune system. And, the placebo effect has a strong impact on the defense against many diseases. This is true enough, but the book does not explain, at least to my satisfaction, how beliefs can have these effects. We learn the ""what"" but not the ""how"". Then, when the book brings in teachings of Jesus, I lost all hope for this book."

But there have been times that I've wondered, ""where's my stuff"" some of the other things I've been trying to manifest. After reading this book, I not only understand how LOA works, but am now able to break through the barriers of the few things I've had a difficult time attracting. Seems too good to be true, from inside the box we've all been trained to think in, but I do believe it's all good and very true! If you're ready for real positive changes, read this book! Also, check out Bruce Lipton's ""Biology of Perception"" lecture on YouTube, it's a great visual companion to the book!"
3,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,3,"3.5 stars. It was going very logical and as expected from a scientist with a spiritual awakening until I hit the last chapter. The last chapter is like: `and now for something completely different`, thunder and smoke, vavavwoom, and `its a slippery thing that slips down the slope as it slips` kind of explanations. And the so called magical PSYCH-K that he directs you to, is just the plain old tool that is being used in hypnosis/hypnotherapy for a hundred years, so no point in presenting it as if they found the gold at the end of the rainbow. Read without high expectations."
4,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,1,"Lipton was once on the faculty at the University of Wisconsin, and then went off to be in a rock band. It appears that loud music and drugs burned out his brain cells. He got a job at a forth rate med school in the Caribbean, but discovered there is more money in writing junk science. This guy is a charlatan, but as H.L. Mencken said, "" nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public"". In this book, Lipton misrepresents the view of contemporary science and demonstrates that he knows nothing at all about quantum mechanics. He preaches that QM is the key to understanding life and it is being hidden by from the public, largely by the interests of the drug industry. There is certainly lots to criticize about the pharmaceutical industry, and also the medical profession, but arguing from ignorance and superstition is not the way to do it. "
5,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8247771-jonathan-jobe,1,"As I read this book I established a love-hate relationship with the author. I agree with the author wholeheartedly that the fields of epigenetics and quantum physics can and will significantly change the way we treat illness. His discussion of the placebo effect with respect to antidepressants was fascinating. However, I became annoyed by his many jabs at ""the establishment"" and his insistence that his ""New Science"" and ""New Biology"" would lead to his condemnation like a modern day Galileo. His sudden leap from ""the environment has an effect on gene expression"" to ""mystical energy and the subconscious mind control everything"" is alarming and not well explained or reasoned.Everything falls apart completely with his Addendum. In the Addendum we learn that a lifetime of subconscious programming can be reversed in just MINUTES through the revolutionary practice of PSYCH-K (TM) starting at $350! The author reduces his entire book to an infomercial for an unscientific and unexplained product.If you choose to read this book, do so with a grain of salt. The author's valid criticism of our drug-focused treatment of illness does not legitimize his mystical beliefs"
6,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277180-christopher,3,"This book was okay. The parts about new biology were interesting, but i just do not feel that the author had a strong enough understanding of the other topics to adequately tie them together. He talked some about quantum mechanics and how it has changed our understanding of reality, but did not make a clear connection between that and what he was saying.Also, he wrote the book as if to say that his message, that people are largely influenced by their environment and are able to make of it what they wish, is some sort of heresy and paradigm shift. And yet he is an american! I feel this is the subject of 80% of every american film, book, play etc. this is the driving theme of all of America: You are a product of your environment, and you can become whatever you want if you put your mind to it.He tried to present the biological basis for this, by showing that cells are not as entirely controlled by dna as had once been thought, which was interesting, and perhaps in the community of cellular biologists is groundbreaking, but when extended by analogy to the terms of every day life, this is a pretty common and well accepted idea, that I don't believe can reasonable be concluded from the cellular biology he presents."
7,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1055768-jenell,4,"Some teachers can just kill your interest in science. They can make it so impossibly abstract that you can’t find any relation to it. Perhaps that is what put me off as I began to read Bruce Lipton’s The Biology of Belief—not that he wasn’t giving a context and showing a relationship to science—quite the opposite. He reminded me of someone receiving an award for the first time and thanking everyone! He was unbridled, unguarded—unintelligent? No! That I was offput by his enthusiasm, is really a reflection on me, not him. We are subtly taught to look cool, to appear unaffected, because if we are moved by something, we might be moved into the unknown. This illusion of control seems solid, but it is death for an organism. It is static, whereas life is responsive, adaptive—dynamic. And so is Bruce Lipton. I appreciate that he loves science and is so enthusiastic about it, while acknowledging that science is the continuing exploration of theories. He adheres to objectivity, one of the main tenets of scientific research, but you can definitely see the twinkle in the eye behind the lens!After Lipton has given us a picture of his academic journey and his unfolding interests, questions and discoveries, he gives a very thorough explanation of the workings of the cell. His writing is well thought-out and organized. He provides extensive end notes as well as referencing other chapters in the book. He really ties everything together and gives great metaphorical examples for laypeople like me so that we can begin to understand the complex machinations, not only of the cell, but of how it is related to quantum physics and what he calls Systems Biology. Lipton believes that the Neo-Darwinian adherence to the theory of survival of the fittest characterizes life in competition, whereas at the cellular level, there is complex communication and collaboration—strength in numbers. The world is not our enemy; it is our belief that it is that causes disease. Beliefs are our subconscious programming. Conversely, if we believe in our vitality, it will flourish. While we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction in our planet’s history, our fate is not sealed. While the segue was a little abrupt, I believe that the implication is that our consciousness can change the future and that we must start with ourselves and our children. I thought, “This is great! I can’t wait to hear his ideas on how to do this!” Lipton explains how we have two minds: the subconscious mind for processing vast amounts of information in the present moment (including habits and beliefs) and the conscious mind that has the ability to learn from the past and plan the future. He states how difficult it is to change subconsciously acquired habits and beliefs. Don’t we all know that! So, how do we do it? How do we change our subconscious programming? Unfortunately, Bruce Lipton is not a psychologist. It is not in the last chapter or the Epilogue—but after that—in the Addendum, that the reader is merely referred to someone who is a psychologist and practices something called PSYCH-K. The “K” stands for kinesiology, the science of human movement. The website referred to was not very revealing, and the one book on it was not well-reviewed, saying it had little substance and appeared to be a promotional ploy to get people to go to the author’s expensive workshops. Though The Biology of Belief was a very good book (so deliciously over my head that it deserves a second read) and so well-referenced throughout—it leaves me shocked that it led to this singular reference on the application of his ideas. But I sense that Bruce Lipton is a seeker, and perhaps his continuing research and collaboration will prove ever more fruitful. He does have an audio cd coming out in October 2008 entitled, Spontaneous Evolution. I’ll have to check that out. "
8,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4788401-lee-harmon,5,"Lipton is a cell biologist whose “study of cells turned [him] into a spiritual person.” This is a highly readable science book, defining how beliefs control behavior and gene activity, and consequently the unfolding of our lives. It’s a fun learning tool that doesn’t dig too deeply, with an uplifting message.Belief truly is biological. One interesting topic that Lipton addresses is the placebo effect. It “is quickly glossed over in medical schools so that students can get to the real tools of modern medicine like drugs and surgery. This is a giant mistake. The placebo affect should be a major topic of study in medical school.” Of course, Lipton is a realist; he realizes placebo pills are a threat to the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the scalpel holders, and Lipton is not one to mince words.It should be pointed out that this is no dry textbook; it borders in places on metaphysical and holistic speculation. But the book is so darn fun. In this light, do not ignore the epilogue; it’s the best part of the book, where Lipton deals with speculative conclusions regarding our “me-ness” and the power of the mind that transformed him into a bubbly, optimistic believer. His “aha” moment was the realization that every protein in our bodies is a physical/electromagnetic complement to something in the environment … that environment being the universe, or to many, God. As we are inextricably intertwined with the divine, survival of the fittest turns out to mean survival of the most loving."
9,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5844166-petra,1,"I still own this book as it was given to me as a present and I am too embarrassed to hand it over to anyone else and thus admitting it is in my possession in the first place. I thought about reading it again and marking all the falsehoods I found within the pages, so in case I die, nobody will think I endorse the contents in any form or way. Okay, jokes aside - reading this book left me so frustrated, I do not exactly feel like writing a tame, sweet, scientific-minded review. This frustration was further fueled by reading some reviews and realizing how easily people are drawn in by hollow pseudoscience and some fancy terms that are used in the hopes that the reader doesn't actually know what they mean and believes the authors' version instead. If you look beyond the fog that this book pulls up, there isn't anything truly valuable to find.Bruce Lipton tries, with a remarkable ability to stretch his imagination to the breaking point, using popular scientific terms like ""quantum physics"" to make his book sound especially fancy and sciency. Behind the smoke screen is not much more than a vivid, unscientific bit of imagination, bloomy speech that manages to intentionally and unintentionally distort the science behind it, spiritual voodoo and a dire need for self-gratification that, luckily, he finds in the few students he managed to pull into the world of his pseudoscience. Bruce Lipton attacks his own false depictions of modern science, also known as ""attacking a straw-man"", and purposefully overestimates single aspects of complex science, while misunderstanding or misrepresenting other aspects, such as the placebo effect. Peppered with claims of mysticism and spiritualism, the book is sure to lull anyone in who would like to have their magical beliefs ratified by science without actually knowing much about it. Surprisingly, this is not the worst book I have ever read, but it comes really close."
10,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1626183-joye,2,"I really wanted to like this book. I just listened to it on a long car ride. First of all, the writing was terrible. He must have used the word ""interesting "" every 3 sentences. I learned very little from this book except some biology about DNA that I hadn't read before.The beginning was interesting(tee hee, there is that word again!) about the history of science and biology, but I had read other books about it in more depth. He was following a thought about the role of DNA in our body's workings and how perception and proteins play a more vital role than we previously thought. I figured he would then logically go to how we can influence our bodies through thoughts and attitudes, but he started rambling about fetuses, upbringing, consciousness, and cognitive therapy. It wasn't presented in a logical way like the beginning was written. It seemed like att the middle of the book a lot of his conclusions were his own without scientific studies to back anything up. When he started to talk about cognitive therapy incorrectly and going to therapy is a waste of time, he lost me. I have read many books about physics, neuro science and psychology and this is the most poorly presented and written I have encountered. Oh well,but I do think we have power over our bodies, this book wasn't one to convince."
11,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42602512-marcos-feole,1,"This book intends to be a nonfiction science book but it isn't. It's pure speculations and inventions of a delusional man. The first three or four chapters are okey, they are about biology science which I don't know much about, so I have to trust him. I have a masters in physics, so I am a technical reader. Since the fifth chapter this guy reveals to me his true face and intentions. This man does not know ANYTHING about quantum mechanics, he does not understand the subject, not even close. It's a shame that this guy has a PHD in any subject, he shows clearly that he doesn't understand even what it is to understand something. I got mad when I read it and hoped that sometime in the future scientists must have a license to write this kind of books. The university should take his PHD degree away after he wrote this, it is really a shame.It is not only speculative, but most of what he says about quantum physics is wrong, he truly did not understand one word of what he read about quantum physics. If you want to keep your neurons healthy, ignore this book, and if you have it, burn it. Don't read this shit, it's unhealthy.The fact that this book has an average rating of 4.19 (april 2015), makes me worry about the future of humanity more than the climate change. This Bruce Lipton guy has to go to jail or something for lying in the face of the non-technical people who read him."
12,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49322-dennis,4,"Outstanding presentation of the science behind positive subconscious programming! Written by a cellular biologist, Dr. Lipton presents a very strong case for why the cell's membrane runs the show and how we directly influence those membranes with our minds.Easy to read. Helps the reader move smoothly beyond outdated Newtonian physics, Descartes' separation of science/spirit, and Darwin's survival of the fittest into Einstein's quantum physics and the truth about cooperative living for survival among single cells that form multicellular organisms. Too involved to write much more about it here...just go get yourself a copy! Definitely worth it.Must Read - 3"
13,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2936507-josh,4,"The Biology of Belief was written to convey “ground-breaking work in the field of new biology.” The author, Dr. Bruce Lipton, certainly has the educational and professional background to deliver this new information. He taught at two medical schools and performed some of his cell research at Stanford University. However, some readers may be disinterested in reading this book simply because the information ‘should be presented in a medical or peer-reviewed journal if the information is accurate and credible.’ I can appreciate this view, but on the other hand, the medical world may not be prepared to accept the information Dr. Lipton includes in these pages.Lipton begins his treatment of the subject on the right foot: discussing his background, his research, and how and why he became so interested in cellular research. He also discusses at length his dissatisfaction with the dominant paradigm in his profession. It is widely accepted in the scientific community that DNA pretty much rules the roost, so to speak. It is “biology’s Central Dogma…The dogma is so fundamental to modern biology it is essentially written in stone, the equivalent of science’s Ten Commandments. The dogma, also referred to as ‘The Primacy of DNA,’ is a fixture of every scientific text” (61). This is the paradigm that Lipton argues against.In order to solidify his point with his readers, later in the book, Lipton has to explain the foundation of his subject, so he discusses at length DNA, cellular proteins, cell biology, and a new field of scientific inquiry called epigenetics. While the average reader may look at this information and think, “that just sounds like reading a science textbook,” in a way, it is. However, Lipton has to talk about it (and does so using language that most readers will easily understand) in order to get to the topic in Chapter 3: the cell membrane. DNA enthusiasts believe that the true “brain” of each individual cell is the nucleus of that cell. The nucleus contains all genetic material, so this makes sense. But Lipton contends that the cell membrane is the actual “brain” of every living cell. This shift in thinking is foundational in Lipton’s premise: that we have the power to actually change our biology simply by believing that we can.Lipton’s journey towards understanding the new biology next took him into the world of physics—specifically, quantum physics, or quantum mechanics as it is commonly called. Quantum mechanics has been around since the days of Einstein’s famous equation: E = mc2. Lipton avoided this field of study as much as possible when he was a biology student because “…almost all of my peers avoided it like the plague. Quantum physics was shrouded in mystery—we biology majors were convinced that it was very, very ‘weird’ science. We thought only physics majors, masochists, and outright fools would risk five credits on a course whose premise was, ‘Now you see it, now you don’t’” (95). Quantum mechanics deals with matter at the sub-atomic level. Remember learning about atoms in school? Quiz question: atoms are made up of what? If you answered protons, electrons, and neutrons, you are correct! If not, most people probably didn’t either. It has probably been a while since you even thought of the word “atom.” Do you remember what protons, electrons, and neutrons actually are? If you said positively, negatively, or neutrally charged particles, you were correct again. If not, well, life goes on. The point is this: atoms are simply small bits of energy, and everything in our universe is made up of atoms. So, at the atomic level, human beings, along with everything else, is composed of energy.Yes, energy. “Einstein revealed that we do not live in a universe with discrete, physical objects separated by dead space. The Universe is one indivisible, dynamic whole in which energy and matter are so deeply entangled it is impossible to consider them as independent elements” (102). Lipton argues that the current medical educational system and profession is “…trained to view the body only as a physical machine that operates in accordance with Newtonian principles…However, because of their Newtonian, materialistic bias, conventional researchers have completely ignored the role that energy plays in health and disease” (102). Because our biology is based on energy at the atomic level, human beings have the power to manipulate their biology for their own good by learning to manipulate that energy. Case in point: the placebo effect.In order to avoid giving away the rest of the story, I will conclude my review here. While it is true that Lipton’s arguments would be “easier to believe” had his findings and conclusions been published in a medical or scientific journal, he uses recent, documented scientific research to back up his claims and conclusions. Overall, Lipton proved his point and piqued my curiosity. The book is well written and follows a thought process that is easy to follow. Oh, and another thing, you do not need to brush up on physics or cell biology to get through this book. I would suggest this book to anyone, whether you are a skeptic or a believer in alternative healing methods. In a world that requires major medical innovations, alternative healing methods may be exactly what the doctor ordered. Dr. Bruce Lipton may, by the final page, make you a believer."
14,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18346013-yasser-mohammad,2,"Once in a while you have to read something that you think is not worth it to open your mind for new ideas that may turn out to be worth it after all. That is why I started reading this book. I expected some more of the law of attraction stuff. I am still 33% through the book and it was much better than what I expected. The idea of the cell not being completely controlled by DNA is for me interesting. Nevertheless, it seems that the author jumps too fast sometimes to unwarranted conclusions. For example, for some reason he seems to imply that energy is not as 'material' as say electrons. This is of course ridiculous because whatever e=mc2 is saying is that both mass and energy are the same thing and even a passing knowledge of relativity shows that the main feature of matter in Descartes's sense (extension) is present in both energy and mass. The author also mentions quantum mechanics many times but I can see no relation between its concepts and whatever he is talking about. Nevertheless, I will complete the book and may have something more to say in a couple of days."
15,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929670-robin,4,"Okay, it IS a science book, but it was really interesting! The author is a cell scientist, and by understanding cells and quantum physics, he sets out to show that our beliefs really do change our biology. I think he does a good job. This also makes a case for why alternative and eastern medicine works, based on energy. He writes in a way that is easy to read in spite of the scientific content. There is a chapter on parenting, and the effect that parents' beliefs and messages have on children (born and unborn), so I hope I was thinking good thoughts when I was responsible for another life!"
16,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797829-rbbiefrah,5,"Lipton makes the point that our conscious thinking affects the environment in our body in which our cells live. He says the cells of our body have a brain which is the membrane of the cell (not the nucleus ) . The membrane of the cell has thousands of protein strands that act as receptors --much like the nerve endings in our skin --these receptors transmit to the cell knowledge of the cells environment --wither be toxic or nutritious and what sort of hormones are out there (stress hormones(fight flight) , or growth hormones (love , nurturing) .He makes a very solid scientific case that it is the environment that the cells membrane is exposed to which is affected primarily by our thoughts (NOT the genetics ) that is the main factor in the cells health and evolutionary development . In his lab experiments . He even got identical cells to mutate in to muscle , bone or fat cells depending on the environment in the container that they where being stored.I definitely agree with the above. It is well documented that loving thoughts and emotions do heal cancer, help plants grow etc etc He makes the point that we have to rise above negative addictions (like sex, food or drug over indulgence which are merely reflexive activities(knee jerk reactions to stimuli regardless of where it is taking us or the price we are paying for these stimuli and involve no conscious intelligence at all ) If These negative addictions dominate our habit patterns we will develop out rear brain( the reflective brain) at the expense of the development of our fore brain ( conscious intelligence) . The blood flow goes to the part of the brain we use the most and away from that which we use least and that is that part that will develop.To over come the negative programming of our subconscious mind which is sabotaging our conscious desires to have happy , loving successful lives we need to use and develop our consciousness (mindfulness) so it dominates and over rides the merely reflexive subconscious mind .The subconscious mind however is much larger that the conscious mind and reprogramming it of all its unhealthy negative sabotaging recordings is not possible unless our conscious reunites with its source which is pure consciousness( aka spirit , energy , the universal higher creative consciousness , God etc ) with the help of this positiveness power which can be contacted only in the part of the brain that is intelligent and conscious can w succeeded in cleansing our subconscious mind of its negative recordings and have fully healthy , happy , loving and successful lives . It is only by trading addiction to teh spirit for sensual addictions that this cleansing can be achieved . By contacting spirit within us and remaining in contact with it all 24 hours we not only gain a healthy body but realize that we are not the body at all but that our home is in spirit -vastly better that this world--to which we no longer have to return .... Spirit has to become our constant companion in life . It heard within our brain as a sweet undulating euphoric music that sustains us and guides us and is very blissful. The natural sate of man is dependence on and companionship with this spirit by it our consciousness is enhanced and our creative consciousness is helped to achieve a high pure noble things in life and we become assets to our generation and our society . Therefore invoking and ,in fact romancing this spirit, should be the primary focus of our lives because by it all things are attained . With the ringing radiance of spirit in very atom of our being our success in all things is assured . It is friend , lover , helper , guide and energizer and is well worth leaving the negative addictions for  2 points I differ with Him on are1) Hypnosis is great tool to help you reprogram your subconscious mind thoughts so that your subconscious mind stops poisoning your cells ( we should never allow any one to hypnotize us as it permanently weakens our will ) rather we should develop the power of our conscious mind by daily meditation as taught by the spiritual teacher of our choice --mine is Baba Gurinder Singh Ji . There eis really no short cut to developing our will power and mental control by meditation and abstinence from animal food, intoxicants(including pot and alcohol ) and sex out of marriage 2) Each cell is a complete miniature reproduction of a human being . While I agree that each cell has its own mind there is only one soul in the body activating and harmonizing all these minds. If we limit our study to teh physical then yes every aspect of a cells behavior does correspond biologically with the entire human organism . ( each cell has organs of reproduction , digestion, filtration, circulation, respiration, regulation , sensation and action --just like a the human being it is part of except THAT it can not reason consciously or question what it is doing here nor consciously contact the source of its consciousness via mediation and merge back into its source attaining God consciousness and REALIZING that it is not the body at all but an eternal being of infinite love , light and bliss .3)There is one more point about which I do not disagree but that I would like to improve upon and clarify.Bruce gives the impression (perhaps unintentionally) that if the cells of a child (or adult) which are in a stressful environment(mindful of stressful thoughts and blood full of stress hormones) the preferential blood flow will be to the hind (reflexive) brain ( fight flight) and to the limbs (legs to run and arms to fight ) and if the cells of a person are in a loving nurturing environment the preferential blood flow will go the fore( intelligent) brain and the visceral organs ( liver, spleen, pancreas , kidneys etc ) that maintain our health .This intentionally or unintentionally gives the impression that a person whose mind is full of flight or fight thoughts and whose blood is full of adrenaline time will be stronger of limb and faster of reflex than a person whose mind is full of loving thoughts and whose blood is full of growth and healing hormones. Yet Dr James Loehr showed that it is alternating waves of stress and loving nurturing that make us tougher ( faster , stronger ) So the strongest fastest person will be one who is maintaining a loving attitude in stressful conditions . In other words a person with a stressful external environment who is maintaining a loving inner environment will be the strongest and fastest(see The Toughness Training manual by Dr James E Loehr)4) So I also to like to add a point that Bruce left out: When we divert the blood flow (nutrients thoughts and hormones ) from the quest for sexual pleasure (which is reflexive) to intelligent pure loving pursuits (like providing food , clothes, shelter to disaster stricken populations) there is a tremendous redirection of the preferential blood flow from the sex organs to the brain , arms and legs . From lust (the reflexive desire to seek pleasure ) we direct out thoughts to love and compassion for our fellow disaster stricken humans .This redirection of sexual energy to acts of pure love has far greater evolutionary and developmental effect on the cells of our bodies than merely redirecting from the hind brain to the fore brain. Pure love untainted by sex makes a human being stronger and faster than anything else . As Bruce wrote ( and all psychiatrists will agree ): “the character of our life is based upon how we perceive it.” and how we perceive life is based on the predominating desires in out conscious and subconscious mind . Therefore I would like to emphasis the supreme importance of stopping dumping pornography into our subconscious mind which will come up to sabotage our attempt to lead a pure , heroic , successful life and go on purifying our subconscious to seek only love in it purest form .Pure Love untainted by sex makes us stronger faster healthier smarter and happier than anything else . When our conscious mind and subconscious mind want nothing but pure love then we shall attain The Christ like perfection and ability to do any miracle that Bruce speaks of in closing this book."
17,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22556012-jenna,5,"A great insightful presentation on the latest modern science on humans consciousness. Something that could be read multiple times to grasp even further. I highly recommend this to anyone, as he does lose me in all the biology, he breaks it down completely and makes it relatable to anyone without a biology background. Uplifting and interesting."
18,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36807880-jakub-micko,2,"It is disappointing and ironic that Lipton is just another ""scientist"" who refuses to actually debate the gray, and instead does the same thing that he vilifies the scientific community of doing: turning complex multifactorial issues into black and white topics. For the most part, I found this book hard to read, a jumpy amalgamation of his life's woes mixed in with fairly creative scientific models which he then leapfrogs off of to present cherry picked studies and a plethora of anecdotal evidence in order to defend his blaming of the ""science boys club"" and ""pharmaceutical"" companies as the causative agents that prevent real progress towards health and happiness. To be fair, by treating health as a black and white issue, for the readers who do not have degrees or strong foundations in medical science, I'm sure most of these ideas sound exciting, compelling, and even plausible. Unfortunately the type of conspiratorial baiting is effective because now even my critique of Liptons book can be discredited with ""oh I must be paid off by a pharmaceutical company to be disagreeing with him.""The reality is that yes of course people would rather take a pill- it's easy and this does not make it inherently bad. Yes it is bad if there is abuse of profits (and there often is), but this is more of a capitalism/economic issue instead of a scientific one, which seems to be a convenient straw man argument that Lipton employs. There are people who work years in order to understand diseases and test out treatments and cures that require the intersection of chemistry/physiology/statistics/bioinformatics, and to discredit them with one alternate study and claims of profiteering seems downright insane. Lipton also ignores the thousands of real Mendelian inherited diseases where a malfunctioning or missing protein is literally the cause of and that a pill with said protein can legitimately cure you. As we research cancers this is sometimes the case, even mutated ones such as the BCR-ABL1 9:22 translocation mutation often found in acute lymphocytic leukemia that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor can allow someone to have much less chemo. The simple truth is that science and the cause and treatment of human disease is infinitely complex and hard. It will be slow progress riddled with mistakes, but progress nonetheless. Ignoring these realities and scientific principles is not an ethically allowable strategy if one wants to help people. Lipton presents some fascinating studies that could have merit- but why give so much weight to a study one team does once and no weight to studies thousands of scientists have done ? That is not how science works- it must be a consensus over time and it is misleading to present arguments in the manner he does. Some examples that stick out I have particular issues with:Trying to make the argument that some research and topics are hidden from students. Honestly, I didn't understand this one at all. Maybe this he's simply old and cynical or because he doesn't teach anymore so he doesn't realize the topics like epigenetics/quantum mechanics/environmental-gene effects are regularly focused on in schooling nowadays. I specifically recall learning tons of ways that environmental signals and their corresponding regulatory proteins control DNA expression, and that ""junk DNA"" is a huge misnomer because it's all basically a sensor for when to activate specific genes. No one is trying to hide these things- there are just so many specialties and research that it can be difficult to learn and understand it all. Using the example of a sentence in an article about a disbeliever to Koch's germ theory swallowing cholera and surviving as a metaphor for science being too dogmatic (pg 119-120). This one Litpon really had to stretch- In the exact same article it says cholera has been a scourge for hundreds of years. Lipton says they should have figured out how he avoided the disease. If he had done more research he would have learnt Pettenkofer did get violent diarrhea and likely didn't die because he had it as a child thereby having protection- simple critical thinking that real scientists do day to day. And by picking on the quick sentence in the article that one reviewer wrote to ascribe a characteristic to all scientists is ridiculous, another strawman. Using articles that encourage pharmaceutical medical interventions in children and then showing more recent articles that prove they should't be used in children (page 194). Yes, this is how science works... no one is going to change medical practices based off of a random study.Having a life changing experience from a chiropractor that used manual muscle testing (page 168). Apparently Lipton also doesn't realize that this is a basic technique taught to and used by most if not all medical professionals to quickly assess musculoskeletal imbalances. This actually weakens his point if anything, because muscle testing is inherently flawed because humans are dominant in one side, and so most professionals just use it as a basic test with much follow up testing. That a chiropractor used just that to lead to some miraculous improvement shows that his training was lacking as well. Giving readers absolutely false misinformation that babies ""automatically swim when placed in water"" (page 170). This one is dangerous. Yes, babies exhibit a bradycardic response of holding their breath when submerged, and make repetitive circling motions with hands and feet that may resemble swimming as a reflex, but this is NOT SWIMMING because they are also not physically strong enough to hold up their heads independently, and thus will drown.I gave 2 stars for the very imaginative ways of describing certain scientific models (the pictures of the butter sandwich are great), and the general attitude of hope. I may disagree with most of it but certain statements such as ""Perhaps the most widespread and insidious form of human violence is ideological control. Throughout history, religious movements and governments have repeatedly prodded their constituents into aggression and violence to deal with dissenters and nonbelievers."" are well written and overall I think he means well, though I think his argument would be strengthened with less anecdotal evidence, and more of a basic understanding of human nature and how research works."
19,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23730910-karl,5,"Having recently listened to Bruce Lipton speak at the annual IONS (Institute of Noetic Sciences) conference I was excited to read this book. Bruce has a knack for taking the information obtained from his scientific background in Biology and making in understandable to someone who has no education in the field of biology. The format Bruce uses, as well as his style, are very “user friendly” and this made for an enjoyable read. As for the material itself, I found that I learned a great deal about the field of Epigenetics and it is refreshing to hear another voice disagreeing with, in my biased opinion, the deterministic views coming from the choir of the majority. Certainly I am no expert in the field of genetics; however, anytime I hear that scientists have found “the answer"" I shudder. The fact that DNA sequencing was supposed to be the holy grail of all things living is no different than when the world was flat and at the center of the universe. I do not dispute the fact that DNA research and the field of genetics is important, but when part of that conclusion says that Mother Nature decided to make 96% of that DNA useless (junk DNA) I tend to believe that there is more to the situation than what we are perceiving or what we have the ability to measure. Perhaps the beleifs of genetic determinism are incomplete, perhaps we need better tools, and perhaps the final word on DNA has yet to be written; however, one thing is certain, the fact is that we don't know everything there is to know and we will only expand our awareness by being open to new ideas.Science is about discovery and a desire to get to truth, yet it seems that many ""so-called"" scientists are no different than the religious zealots that burned people at the stake 500 years ago. Anyone remember Giordano Bruno? So, what does this have to do with the “Biology of Belief”? Well, in this book Bruce goes against the deterministic view and says that it is not only genetics that shape our inner world, it is the environment as well. This book is one of self-empowerment because it says that you aren’t just a machine following orders that came from pond scum 700 million years ago. You have the ability to transform your outer world and INNER world. Empowered people are healthier and harder to control then their unaware counterparts and they use less pharmaceutical interventions. Hmmm, so by being aware of our power we take money out of the pharma’s pockets, who are the ones providing so much of the funding to the scientific quacks. No wonder the mainstream scientists resist work such as this, it’s their pocket book stupid (you need to read the book to get the gist of that last statement). In the end, ironically perhaps, the quasi-scientists of today will go the way of their ancestors and go extinct because they refuse to look at the facts, to adapt to the environment and view new ideas with curiosity rather than dogma. Perhaps the title of Bruce’s next book could be something like, “Did dinosaurs wear lab coats?”"
20,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237679-joey,4,"I want to shove this book in Ritchie Shoemaker's face, but then again I think he helped a lot of us with dreaded genes realize we have to work a lot harder to regain our health. And no that's not a bad thing. This is one of those books that I would shamelessly recommend to any of my med school friends to nudge a healthy dose of skepticism into lifetimes that will be largely involved with genetic engineering, aka the future of the medical-pharmaceutical complex (When is someone gonna make Fog of Medicine?--granted doesn't have the same ring as Fog of War.) As Dr. Lipton called it, we're in the midst of a ""cosmic joke"" or in plainer terms, a universal paradox. Even the brightest of scientists and doctors are buying into the idea that we are our genes, and that our lot is written at conception. Dr. Lipton used to be a med school professor and researcher at U of Wisconsin and Stanford for 20 years. When he found out that the destiny of cells wasn't shaped so much by genes as it was by the environment within the petri dish cultures he was incubating, he resigned his job and went on a mission to flesh out the ""new biology,"" or a biology which is shaped by perception, all the way from the microcosm of the nucleus and cell to the macro conscious & subconscious mind. This meshes well with terrain-based infectious theories of Bechamp, Rife, Enderlein etc. By the time I was 2/3 through, I had one more solid piece of evidence to back up my belief that my ""dreaded"" HLA-DR genome was in any shape or form a terminal sentence on my well-being. Change the signals, change your genetic expression. Every genetic code has 30,000 different possible expressions, and we're busy trying to splice into the blueprint rather than trying to effect positive expression? One of my favorite Lipton analogies: the nucleus that contains the gene is just the gonad. The skin of the cell, or the cellular membrane, is the real brain.Haha Mr. Nucleus. You're only balls deep.Despite its woo-woo title, this book isn't for those seeking self-help insight. It is really a hard-data biological explanation of why new-age concepts such as the law of attraction and energetic psychology (EFT, MFT, Psych K) deserve to be way more popular than they already are. "
21,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5485612-iona-stewart,4,"This is an exciting book that reveals a scientific basis for the demolition of the theory of genetic determinism.In his work as a cell biologist Lipton discovered that the cell membrane and not the gene-containing nucleus is responsible for what happens in the cell. He thereby concludes that we are not controlled by our genes but that it is our interactions with the environment that are significant. His book thus provides a weighty contribution to the nature-nurture debate.He also refutes the old Darwinian beliefs that evolution occurs through combat and struggle, and confirms the validity of the work of the much maligned biologist Lamarck.I freely admit that many of the scientific details contained in this book are beyond my understanding. Nevertheless, Lipton's description of his enthusiasm when experiencing his big insight, and of the effect his revelation had on his beliefs, development and life as a whole make this book far from dry, and in fact fascinating.We learn from the book that regardless of our genes and our circumstances we can change our lives through our thoughts and feelings, though the author emphasizes that our subconscious programmes are a force to be reckoned with, re-programming thus being essential.I highly recommend this book!"
22,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77527711-j-c-ahmed,2,"I find the idea of how beliefs affect health to be very interesting (think of the placebo effect or the effects of stress on physical health), but I’ve avoided this book due to criticisms that it veers into pseudoscience despite being written by a biologist. When I came across an abridged 2 hour audio version of The Biology of Belief on Libby, I thought I’d give it a listen and see what I thought. One common criticism of Lipton is that he makes leaps in logic without enough research to support his claims. As an example, the placebo effect is a real thing. But Lipton uses it as evidence that positive thinking/changing your mindset can cure physical ailments. I’m not aware of any science that backs this up. From everything I’ve read about placebos, they don’t cure illnesses, their effects are short-lived and they only work on certain kinds of symptoms like pain and insomnia. While I think having a positive outlook and reducing stress can impact physical health, I think Lipton took the idea way too far. Also, his overuse of the word ‘interesting’ started to drive me crazy about half way through the book. The impact of beliefs on health is an important topic, but this book didn’t come across as a balanced examination of the issue. "
23,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13769366-hal,2,I'm not sure what to make of this book really. I got it from a bibliography from all things of a book about trading. So I was thinking I would get something on spiritualism or motivation/self improvement. Something along those lines. The book mostly focused on fairly high level biology of cell behavior. What was kind of funny is he inferred he did not want to get too technical being a biology professor then proceeded to spend about three-fourths of the book talking about technical biology matters. For me anyway. The tie in from biology to belief was vague. There were nuggets of interesting things he pointed out about learning and being programmed that refuted the hard wired concepts of genetics. At the very conclusion he got into some of the things I was anticipating in the book but also gave what I construed as the typical sermon of new age principles relating to the environment and living in harmony with nature. I can hardly endorse the book due to the far flung nature of the things he gets into but for some it might just be their cup of tea.

Bruce Lipton, Ph.D., a cellular biologist, has an easy style and has a great sense of humor. I know a lot about consciousness as cause (Law of Attraction)--I teach courses on the subject myself--but, because Lipton is a cellular biologist, he's coming from the point of view of our cells--and showing scientifically the biochemical effects of our thoughts on our cells and thus our bodies. He is making the ""new biology"" interesting and assessible. I already recommend it! On the same topic, I loved Dr. Candace Pert's book ""Molecules of Emotion"" and the DVD set, ""The Body is the Subconscious Mind"" is even better."

It's a really easy read and a big eye-opener once you consider the implications of what Dr. Lipton has to say. Very nice to have some actual research data to finally back up the real possiblily that the human spirit does have eternal existence. Also makes a great case for why all areas of science should be moving beyond ""outdated Newtonian physics, Descartes' separation of science/spirit, and Darwin's survival of the fittest into Einstein's quantum physics.""

27,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista,5,This book is a game changer. Genes are not as controlling as we are led to believe.

28,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,1,"Pretty typical pseudoscience BS. You know pseudoscience by its label ""New Science."" Is that like New Coke? There is no New Science. There's just Science. Imagine a book labeled New Science Fiction or New Fiction. Of course it's new. Everything is new when it comes out, until it's not new. I'd expect a new book on science to contain the latest research. Otherwise, it would probably be called History of Science. So the fact that this book isn't called Science but New Science is a dead giveaway that it's not actually Science but Pseudoscience. And if that isn't a dead giveaway, then surely the subtitle is: ""Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter & Miracles."" Um, Miracles? Those phenomena attributed to supernatural powers? Science is the study of nature. Supernatural means above nature. Ergo: Miracles are not science.Pseudoscience is very compelling for people with no background in science. People have always wanted answers, and are easily entertained by outrageous answers. That's the purpose religion has served, but now that science is considered a more legitimate form of inquiry, people expect modern answers to have the scientific stamp of approval. So pseudoscience includes enough legitimate science to seem authentic, but comes to outrageous conclusions, which the evidence doesn't actually support. End result: People who don't know better are wowed, which sells books while diluting real science and confusing public understanding of it.This particular book is by a nut who was suicidal and had a spiritual awakening through his research. He claims that he submitted his research to journals, but they were rejected because Science is an old boys club. Translation: His research was rejected because of insufficient evidence and/or repeatability. Real scientists are used to failure, and they learn from it. Pseudoscientists write books about it and call it New Science.Just a taste of some of the silliness in this book: Cells membranes help them function, therefore we're not limited by our genetics; matter and energy become interchangeable as the speed of light is approached (Relativity), therefore all matter is therefore just energy, and we can pick up on one another's ""vibes""; at the subatomic level, traditional Newtonian physics no longer applies, therefore traditional physics is done for and quantum physics can be applied at the cellular level; beliefs can affect a medication's potency (Placebo effect), therefore we can radically change our bodies just by thinking differently; and my favorite: HLAs are effectively unique to each individual, therefore our ""selves"" are spirits which are reincarnated to whomever acquires our HLAs.Trust me, if scientists found evidence for any of this, you'll know about it. It will be published in journals, the scientific community would be embroiled in controversy (controversy doesn't imply falsehood in science; it's part of the process, with healthy debate among scientists who try to prove and disprove each other's works, eventually leading to a consensus), and the media would be having a field day with it. You won't need to read about it in some suicidal scientist's pop science book."
29,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22015143-dixit-nagpal,4,I always felt that somehow our thoughts shape us and also the aura we carry with us. This book further strengthens the power of self talk with obviously supporting it by building blocks of biology and how a cell behaves with environment and gets impacted by stimuli it's been acted under. This book will bring you clarity on how you can rewrite your health and mental mindset by just becoming conscious to what you are telling to yourself on day to day basis however I still doubt and question on whether there is still some higher being who is driving this. and another point where this book goes wrong is deciphering Darwin's theory on selfish gene. I think Darwin never said that world is cruel and selfish. rather he was biggest promoter of species as one as selfish to survive which can only happen if u r being on top of food chain and that's not being selfish that's just being part of evolution which has nothing to do with invisible hand being present. This book also states that memory is not just limited to brain but each cell has it's own memory and that lives and get transferred to people even when we do organ transplant but the points about reincarnation and people remembering precious lives is bit odd to me. well that's readers to make their own judgements about the latter stuff.Nonetheless i strongly believe that we can change anything by changing about how we think and create thoughts that are being absorbed by our subconscious all the time.
30,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18488542-debbie,4,"In college, I was took two semesters of General Chem, Biology, and Physics simultaneously (that was a busy year!) and I have to say, I saw similar patterns to Dr. Lipton, despite (or, perhaps BECAUSE OF) my lack of knowledge of genetics. I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

34,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
35,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

42,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."

I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me. It need more than just saying love was at the center of everything. The chapter on physics helped make the connection for me more than anything else. Overall, was a fun read and i would recommend to anyone that wants to learn some basic biology/physics applications."
44,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"This book was great. It is more an account of Bruce Lipton's journey. Still, it's an awesome journey. P. 31, He talks about Darwin and how competition is not the only or even best way. This goes on for a bit and he mentions Lamarck being earlier and not being as biased. I want to read up further on this for sure.P. 33 - Systems Biology is discussed as a new alternative to this idea of Competition.P. 68 - he talks about the importance of quantum physics and its implications for consciousness and concept of energy powerP. 88 This whole section and his concepts of conscious and unconscious belief. The unconscious can def sabotage... this is important. you have to address that.p. 100 Glad to see this quote from Mahatma Gandhi bringing it back in to this idea of how beliefs, thoughts, words, actions, habits and values...the point is the relationship between beliefs and the physical world that we believe of as reality. p. 114 goes further into this multi-chapter description of how to go about reprogramming your mind. They section talks about alpha waves and the beta brain. Definitely want to learn a lot more about this. "
45,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

Let go of your picture set goals and dream. Life is amazing. 
49,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

Also, how we can change our beliefs to better create the life we really want. "
51,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,2,"This book has an amazingly woo-ful aura. If it hadn't been recommended to me by someone I respect very much, no way I'd read it. Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"
52,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,2,"First, be aware that this isn't so much an audiobook as it is a 3-hour lecture. The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
53,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
54,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
55,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
56,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
57,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
58,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

64,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
65,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."

I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me. It need more than just saying love was at the center of everything. The chapter on physics helped make the connection for me more than anything else. Overall, was a fun read and i would recommend to anyone that wants to learn some basic biology/physics applications."
74,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"This book was great. It is more an account of Bruce Lipton's journey. Still, it's an awesome journey. P. 31, He talks about Darwin and how competition is not the only or even best way. This goes on for a bit and he mentions Lamarck being earlier and not being as biased. I want to read up further on this for sure.P. 33 - Systems Biology is discussed as a new alternative to this idea of Competition.P. 68 - he talks about the importance of quantum physics and its implications for consciousness and concept of energy powerP. 88 This whole section and his concepts of conscious and unconscious belief. The unconscious can def sabotage... this is important. you have to address that.p. 100 Glad to see this quote from Mahatma Gandhi bringing it back in to this idea of how beliefs, thoughts, words, actions, habits and values...the point is the relationship between beliefs and the physical world that we believe of as reality. p. 114 goes further into this multi-chapter description of how to go about reprogramming your mind. They section talks about alpha waves and the beta brain. Definitely want to learn a lot more about this. "
75,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

The science is interesting but I believe the point is that we’re way more powerful then we allow ourselves to be. Open your mind to endless possibilities and things start happening in your life. Let go of your picture set goals and dream. Life is amazing. 
79,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

I feel this book should be read by everyone because Dr. Lipton, through the explanation of biology, helps us understand why we do what we do in an easy to read book. Also, how we can change our beliefs to better create the life we really want. "
81,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,2,"This book has an amazingly woo-ful aura. If it hadn't been recommended to me by someone I respect very much, no way I'd read it. Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"
82,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,2,"First, be aware that this isn't so much an audiobook as it is a 3-hour lecture. The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
83,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
84,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
85,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
86,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
87,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
88,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

94,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
95,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

I like that it is based in science and has quick summaries of research studies to support its ideas. The additional notes in the 10-year anniversary edition are better just skimmed, as they repeat concepts in the main chapters. Overall, the book is motivating and a good read."

102,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."
103,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93149677-haneen,3,"Was good enough, but as someone with a background in biology i expected more. I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me. It need more than just saying love was at the center of everything. The chapter on physics helped make the connection for me more than anything else. Overall, was a fun read and i would recommend to anyone that wants to learn some basic biology/physics applications."
104,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"This book was great. It is more an account of Bruce Lipton's journey. Still, it's an awesome journey. P. 31, He talks about Darwin and how competition is not the only or even best way. This goes on for a bit and he mentions Lamarck being earlier and not being as biased. I want to read up further on this for sure.P. 33 - Systems Biology is discussed as a new alternative to this idea of Competition.P. 68 - he talks about the importance of quantum physics and its implications for consciousness and concept of energy powerP. 88 This whole section and his concepts of conscious and unconscious belief. The unconscious can def sabotage... this is important. you have to address that.p. 100 Glad to see this quote from Mahatma Gandhi bringing it back in to this idea of how beliefs, thoughts, words, actions, habits and values...the point is the relationship between beliefs and the physical world that we believe of as reality. p. 114 goes further into this multi-chapter description of how to go about reprogramming your mind. They section talks about alpha waves and the beta brain. Definitely want to learn a lot more about this. "
105,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

The science is interesting but I believe the point is that we’re way more powerful then we allow ourselves to be. Open your mind to endless possibilities and things start happening in your life. Let go of your picture set goals and dream. Life is amazing. 
109,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

I feel this book should be read by everyone because Dr. Lipton, through the explanation of biology, helps us understand why we do what we do in an easy to read book. Also, how we can change our beliefs to better create the life we really want. "
111,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,2,"This book has an amazingly woo-ful aura. If it hadn't been recommended to me by someone I respect very much, no way I'd read it. Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"
112,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,2,"First, be aware that this isn't so much an audiobook as it is a 3-hour lecture. The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
113,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
114,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
115,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
116,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
117,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
118,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

124,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
125,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

132,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."
133,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93149677-haneen,3,"Was good enough, but as someone with a background in biology i expected more. I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me. It need more than just saying love was at the center of everything. The chapter on physics helped make the connection for me more than anything else. Overall, was a fun read and i would recommend to anyone that wants to learn some basic biology/physics applications."
134,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"This book was great. It is more an account of Bruce Lipton's journey. Still, it's an awesome journey. P. 31, He talks about Darwin and how competition is not the only or even best way. This goes on for a bit and he mentions Lamarck being earlier and not being as biased. I want to read up further on this for sure.P. 33 - Systems Biology is discussed as a new alternative to this idea of Competition.P. 68 - he talks about the importance of quantum physics and its implications for consciousness and concept of energy powerP. 88 This whole section and his concepts of conscious and unconscious belief.

135,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

Let go of your picture set goals and dream. Life is amazing. 
139,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

141,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,2,"This book has an amazingly woo-ful aura. If it hadn't been recommended to me by someone I respect very much, no way I'd read it. Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"
142,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,2,"First, be aware that this isn't so much an audiobook as it is a 3-hour lecture. The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
143,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
144,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
145,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
146,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
147,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
148,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

154,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
155,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

162,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."
163,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93149677-haneen,3,"Was good enough, but as someone with a background in biology i expected more. I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me. It need more than just saying love was at the center of everything. The chapter on physics helped make the connection for me more than anything else. Overall, was a fun read and i would recommend to anyone that wants to learn some basic biology/physics applications."
164,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"This book was great. It is more an account of Bruce Lipton's journey. Still, it's an awesome journey. P. 31, He talks about Darwin and how competition is not the only or even best way. This goes on for a bit and he mentions Lamarck being earlier and not being as biased. I want to read up further on this for sure.P. 33 - Systems Biology is discussed as a new alternative to this idea of Competition.P. 68 - he talks about the importance of quantum physics and its implications for consciousness and concept of energy powerP. 88 This whole section and his concepts of conscious and unconscious belief. The unconscious can def sabotage... this is important. you have to address that.p. 100 Glad to see this quote from Mahatma Gandhi bringing it back in to this idea of how beliefs, thoughts, words, actions, habits and values...the point is the relationship between beliefs and the physical world that we believe of as reality. p. 114 goes further into this multi-chapter description of how to go about reprogramming your mind.

165,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

Let go of your picture set goals and dream. Life is amazing. 
169,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

171,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,2,"This book has an amazingly woo-ful aura. If it hadn't been recommended to me by someone I respect very much, no way I'd read it. Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"
172,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,2,"First, be aware that this isn't so much an audiobook as it is a 3-hour lecture. The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
173,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
174,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
175,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
176,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
177,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
178,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

184,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
185,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

192,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."

I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me. It need more than just saying love was at the center of everything. The chapter on physics helped make the connection for me more than anything else. Overall, was a fun read and i would recommend to anyone that wants to learn some basic biology/physics applications."

I want to read up further on this for sure.P. 33 - Systems Biology is discussed as a new alternative to this idea of Competition.P. 68 - he talks about the importance of quantum physics and its implications for consciousness and concept of energy powerP. 88 This whole section and his concepts of conscious and unconscious belief.

195,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

Let go of your picture set goals and dream. Life is amazing. 
199,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

201,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,2,"This book has an amazingly woo-ful aura. If it hadn't been recommended to me by someone I respect very much, no way I'd read it. Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"
202,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,2,"First, be aware that this isn't so much an audiobook as it is a 3-hour lecture. The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
203,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
204,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
205,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
206,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
207,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
208,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

214,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
215,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

222,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."

I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me. It need more than just saying love was at the center of everything. The chapter on physics helped make the connection for me more than anything else. Overall, was a fun read and i would recommend to anyone that wants to learn some basic biology/physics applications."

225,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

Let go of your picture set goals and dream. Life is amazing. 
229,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

231,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,2,"This book has an amazingly woo-ful aura. If it hadn't been recommended to me by someone I respect very much, no way I'd read it. Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"
232,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,2,"First, be aware that this isn't so much an audiobook as it is a 3-hour lecture. The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
233,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
234,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
235,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
236,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
237,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
238,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

244,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
245,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

252,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."

I read this book to gain a better understanding of positive energy feedbacks in biological systems (nature, humans, interconnected symbiosis) but felt that it was too “layman” for me.

255,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,3,Interesting to see how the membranes and not the DNA are really the brains of the cells and how they read the environment and intelligently controls what goes in and out. So the signals in our consciousness matter. I like epigenetics because it is not deterministic. I like how Bruce Lipton describes the conscious front lobe (the ability to toggle between past and future) and the subconscious limbic brain (only cares about the now). But I really need to read more to understand this better. The second half of the book and ending are a bit of a let down as it feels inconclusive.

259,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

Oddly, it does seem to be living up to the description I was given--scientific basis for the power of mindfulness--but the mega cheese vibes it gives off continue unabated. The cover image is an obvious start, but even the type and the paper somehow scream ""this is a foo-foo book of ridiculi! Don't waste your time!"" to me. I can't put my finger on exactly how, and it's driving me nuts. The paper is thicker and whiter than normal books; so far, that's all I've got. It's reminding me of the story in _Blink_ where a bunch of experts could tell the sculpture was fake, but they couldn't really say why, just an off feeling....The book was ok. The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"

The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge.

He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
264,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
265,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
266,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
267,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
268,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "

I do think when you look at several fields of science and humanities concurrently, your mind tends to integrate all of the information, rather than compartmentalizing it. I don't think it was until my second semester of physics, during a lecture on the theory of relativity, that I became certain of my own belief in God. I guess because I found God through science, I think that route of understanding is normal, but I realize it doesn't usually happen that way for most people.Most of my criticisms of the book have to do with construction, not content, of the book. The first few chapters of this book felt a bit like a weak attempt to build the credibility of the author. I tend to think that cutting directly to the chase is more important than explaining how he came to see certain connections: DON'T BURY THE LEAD!!! The cover and the beginning detract from him, making him look like a new-age wacko/loser (if viewing from a traditional lens), but I suppose it was important for him to key in on a sympathetic audience who is primed to hear his message, rather than to make an attempt with the hard-core, anti-God scientists who think they, themselves, should play God...you know the ones I'm talking about, the geneticists who envision a genetically-engineered future and who secretly believe in euthanasia and testing on unwilling human subjects in the aims of a more perfect society, and the ones who look at life-long illness as a lucrative business...(I should note here that I don't identify with the religious fundamentalists who don't acknowledge evolution as a plausible scientific theory, in case you're wondering...)Nonetheless, the core content is well explained for people who have a minimal understanding of cell biology, ecology, and physics. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open to seeing the bigger picture and living more in accordance with natural law.I was disappointed that Dr. Lipton undermines many of his own conclusions by separating them from the body of the text in an epilogue. I suppose he does this to prevent the proverbial baby from being thrown out with the bath water in the scientific community. Bthe truth is, it is the ENTIRE point of the book, and some people are too committed and entrenched in wrong/compartmentalized thinking to see what truths this book might hold.Science IS the study of natural law and spirit, whether people like to think of it in those terms or not. Overall a worthwhile read for those who like to see connections between science and spirit."

274,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61972675-scott-vandervort,4,"The overall theme is that you genes don’t determine your future. Being a cell biologist by nature the author argues that we are the product of our interactions with our environment. Our interactions are governed by protein receptors embedded in the membranes of our cells. The protein receptors on a cell are determined by our DNA during cell replication. Parts of our DNA, however, can be sheathed, or obscured. Obscured DNA can dramatically change which protein receptors exist on the membranes of our cells. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics, in theory, allows us to have different traits than those inherited through our parents DNA. It can cause twins to have different traits. It can even cause disease such as cancer.The author then explains how, as a multicellular organism, our individual cells interactions with the environment can be overridden by our brain. Our environment influences us, but ultimately we have control of our reaction to it.Then the author introduces quantum mechanics and things get more theoretical. He suggests that pure energy can influence cells - and not just radiation, but magnetic energy and even thoughts. He explains that modern medical devices, such as the MRI are only possible because our cells produce a vibration, or energy. He suggests that a cancerous cell has a different energy and by changing the energy that it produces, you could theoretically eliminate the cancer.He then delves into how we have both a conscious and subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the quick, reactive “autopilot” that keeps us from walking off cliffs and such. The conscious mind is the slower, contemplative, analytical “thinker” what makes us human. The subconscious mind can easily override the conscious mind, making our reactions to the environment less than ideal ( think sweaty palms, or a nervous stomach ). It’s up to the conscious mind to reprogram our subconscious on how to properly react to our environment.Finally, in the epilogue, the author takes the main theme to the extreme. He suggests that because we are a product of our environment, our body is in turn just a receptor, not a receptacle for what is essentially our consciousness, or soul. Our soul exists in the environment and is immortal. Using a television as an analogy he suggests that if another receptor, or body, is created that “tunes into” the same signal, then it will pick up and “play” our soul.Whoa, right? It does kind of make sense, but it would also mean that right now there could very well be a doppelganger of yourself living, happily, somewhere else. "
275,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42881410-vishal-bawa,5,"This books demonstrates the pinnacle of human evolution just by tuning or re tuning our belief set. Dr. Lipton has demonstrated the biological sequence of our awareness by dismantling the entire process of initiation and development of a certain belief. It is a wonderful read which delves upon the human nature, and narrates its drive from the channel of DNA and proteins. He has wonderfully shared details about the chronological evolution of biological science, and how epigenetics came into existence.'We are just an epigenetic mechanism in a process called genetic capacitation.'And very interestingly, the book has been able to express the technical aspects of cellular development from a foetus to an adult human brain in a very lucid method. It also describes the nature of human brain in various age groups, and the reason behind the nature we adopt over a period of time. And when the author is taking us through the magnificent world of biological science, in the journey we get to identify the entire process progressing with the crafting and recrafting of our lives. It all boils down to the 'perception' which actually sits in the driving seat of our lives and maneuvers through unlimited facets of our individual roadmaps.Dr. Lipton ended the book with interesting suggestions to handle and enable our subconscious mind, and reinvent it with our conscious existence and experience. It is the conscious creative energy which has the power to control, manage and flourish the nature(Instincts) and nurture(Subconscious) energies. Although consciousness as expressed in the book was just an add-on to the evolution, we can see the difference it has made to the human kind. The author has also laid emphasis on the HPA axis, and how it adopts growth or protection mode based on the perception of our external environment. 'Human is made in the image of the cell.' A fascinating read for those who are looking to find heaven on this planet while existing in the same dimensions yet identifying with multi dimensional existence. The realm of our thoughts is an outpour of super energy which can enable an unbelievable life. "

282,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"Partly life science, partly life story, this book points the way beyond a mechanical view of life.It's the kind of science book I really enjoy: a bold, paradigm-shifting theory presented by a researcher who knows what he's talking about. One of the ways Bruce H. Lipton busts conventions in this book is by spending so much time talking about his own life. And while his life is very interesting, in most scientific books this might be perceived as self-indulgent; in this case, however, it fits perfectly due to the nature of the theory that he is presenting, and its implications.For the core assertion of this book, contrary to the ""central dogma"" of cell biology, is that genes are not destiny. For proof the author offers the simple fact that genes are not self-activating; the genes of a cell, encoded in its chromosomes, are activated by triggers coming from outside the cell's nucleus, and ultimately from outside the cell itself. It is the cell's environment that dictates how a cell will behave, and which genes will be activated, and when.The author spends time showing how it is not the cell's nucleus, with its set of chromosomes, that is the ""brain"" of the cell, but rather the cell's membrane--the fatty envelope that holds the cell together--that performs this function. It is the cell's membrane that holds all of its sensory apparatus and does its decision-making. Lipton points out that in the development of an embryo, the cells that go on to form the skin of the newborn also go on to form its brain and nervous system, pointing back, he thinks, to the identity of these functions in the single cell.Lipton then goes on to talk about quantum physics and its implications for biology. He observes that biologists in general, including himself, tend not to have a very sophisticated understanding of physics, limiting themselves to a few courses on basic Newtonian physics early in their university careers. But physics has moved on from Newton. The 20th century brought the stunning revelations of quantum physics; what do these mean for biology?Lots, according to Lipton. For just as Einstein's theory of relativity showed the deep identity between matter and energy, so quantum theory has shown the deep identity between mind and matter, or mind and the physical world of matter-energy. This means that the ""environment"" of a cell--and each of us is a collection of several trillion cells--is not just the physical medium in which it rests, but also the mental medium surrounding it. Each cell responds sensitively to the innumerable gross and subtle influences on it, chemical, physical, electrical, and mental or spiritual. The response is determined by the cell's membrane, and the genes execute that response.If Lipton is right about this--and he has persuaded me that he is--then the implications for each of us are vast. For we are not, as biological and medical science currently teach us, mere organic robots executing programs encoded in our genes, which were bestowed on us at birth and cannot be changed. We are active, choosing participants in our world and in our life, whose genes are following the commands that we are directly or indirectly sending them. If we wish to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, our task is to discover how to send the right instructions to our own genes.This is easier said than done, but it is eminently possible, and certainly more so than changing our genome.The insights that the author presents so simply and picturesquely--he has honed his presentation of the ideas over many speaking engagements with nontechnical audiences--are easy to grasp for the nonscientist. Indeed, if you have scientific training you may find his explanations too simplistic and protracted.He understands the difficulty people may have in accepting these ideas, for he arrived at them only over a long period, and with a number of setbacks along the way. But the accounts of how he made his discoveries have the mark of authenticity, and are exciting, as all stories of discovery are.One of Lipton's strongest messages is that his discoveries have changed his own life, not just professionally, but to the core. He frankly admits that as a young man he was unhappy and envious of others; but since his discoveries in cellular biology, he has found the means to change his thinking and become a happy person. And it is this power which he wishes to help put in the reader's hands.He doesn't actually do this, though, for it turns out that the most important factor in improving the biology of our own cells is amending our subconscious beliefs (hence the title of the book), and there is no book-given way of doing this. He suggests a couple of possibilities for the reader to pursue, but other than that, you're on your own.But the book as it is presents a wonderful message. It is joyous, freeing, and empowering. Our cells are here to help us achieve what we want to achieve in life; we just need to learn to tell them what to do."

289,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033931-brian,4,"The main hypothesis of Dr. Lipton's book is that the environment that an individual encounters is more influential to their destiny than their biological genes. He supports this hypothesis by comparing humans to the cells that each and every one of us is made of. He debates that every individual cell is controlled more by the signals it receives through its cell membrane than by the genes contained in the nucleus. His metaphor involving a computer in this section draws a clear picture even for those of us with only limited biology experience. In act, all of the metaphors used in this book help to click everything into place- you can tell that Dr. Lipton has extensive experience as a teacher. The implications of his new biology are empowering- no longer do you need to feel like the victim of biology. By changing your perception of the world, you can change your environment and relieve yourself from the constant stress that causes illness and unhappiness. We all are programmed with behaviors through nurture starting at an early age, and unlike genetics these actions can be corrected. His claims also provide a scientific backbone as to why energy healing and other non-western approaches to medicine work despite big pharma's attempt to disprove them. A little belief can go a long way.This book is rather dense with biological principles, and at times it can be difficult to see where the points being argued by Dr. Lipton fit into the larger picture he is trying to paint. Furthermore, there is a lot of reference to quantum physics in this book, but little of it is used other than Einstein's mass-energy equivalence theorem. I would love to see a further expanded version that discusses how other parts of quantum physics would fit into this new biological view presented by Dr. Lipton.As an electrical engineer, this book particularly intrigued me during the portions that it discussed how susceptible our cells are to electromagnetic radiation. It makes you wonder how the waves from the cell phones in our pockets, the electrical lines running through our homes, and the countless other frequencies we encounter on a day by day basis effect our overall health over time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind looking to bridge gaps between spirituality and science with a solid biological foundation built by a great teacher."

The main part was all science stuff that matched up well enough with what I remember from school that I think it's true. I like his point that our genes don't control our destiny and we can become what we want to be if we work toward it and be positive and stuff. That was all good.Where the book falls short for me is that all along, he keeps promising our genetics don't control us, we can control us. But then he ends with this whole long thing about how a baby's life in the womb before it's born, especially the mother's stress chemicals and whether she wants the baby and stuff, determine things like whether the person will have high blood pressure 40-50 years later. WTF! Not too cheery for someone who came along and destroyed her mother's life as she knew it at the time. Also, this kind of undoes his point that we aren't helpless victims. And after all that ""you can do it! You just need to start believing you can and reprogram the garbage out of your mind!"" he never says anything about how to do that. I swear he promised it several times, but I could be wrong. He just ends with ""go look up this program called Psych-K by my friend."" Thanks. :P"

The pacing and annoying repetition of phrases (""and the answer is..."" ""and the reason is..."") make it clear that it's not being read or at least not from anything well-edited.Irritations with the presentation aside, the first half of this audio program was quite interesting. I learned a lot about how cells work and how they convey information from their environment, and what the interaction between proteins and DNA actually is. Unfortunately, from there the author/speaker takes a huge leap from what he calls ""perception"" at the cellular level to be equivalent to our perceptions and beliefs on the larger level. Much of what he says from then on draws not on research but on top-of-mind examples, some of which I know to be false or limited (e.g., a young boy looks to his father to see how a man acts and to his mother to form impressions of his future partner). I thought near the end he was going to tie it all back together by explaining the importance of surrounding yourself with a positive environment in order to reprogram your subconscious. But instead he talks about how you can't consciously override your subconscious programming from childhood, and then at the end throws out some last-ditch New Age-y ideas about hypnosis and ""energy"" therapies that can reprogram your mind.If you're interested in overriding bad habits, there are much better books out there, such as The Power of Habit and Nudge. Try the first two CDs of this if you're super-interested in cell biology; otherwise, skip it."
293,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92737-justine,3,"In terms of epigenetics vs. genetics, Bruce Lipton leans much more towards genetics although he contradicts himself when he tries to apply his theory about biology to societies.I loved his illustration of how cell membranes work -- using two pieces of bread, a large chunk of butter and olives! He makes it all intuitive. He proves that the real brains of the cell is not the nucleus, as I was taught in 7th grade, but it is actually the membrane. The nucleus is more like the ""gonads"" -- as he calls it. It's not necessary for the cell to live. In fact, cells can live for up to 2 months without a nucleus, but without their membrane they die automatically. It was interesting to learn tidbits about what I don't know --I'll need to check out a quantum physics book next. He makes a damn good case that biologists lack of understanding of quantum physics causes them to disregard the effects of energy on our cells. However, in the Epilogue, Lipton starts to make connections to greater society and the ecosystem, mentioning that we need to have a communitarian (centrally controlled) system where we aren't warring with each other. Living peacefully. Then in one of his examples he mentioned how a group of violent chimpanzees managed to reform when the most aggressive males ate some bad meat which killed them, leaving the women and less aggressive men to form a more peaceful society. But in the previous sentence he advocates for accepting everyone in the world as they are. Doesn't this seem like a contradiction to say that we must remove the violent/aggressive elements in society while accepting them? His ideas on biology are intriguing but I don't think that he is quite skilled at making assessments about political-economy, international relations, and other social science issues."
294,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8520344-ron-campbell,5,"This book is what started my awareness of the importance of our Belief System. It also started to show me how Consciousness expands to everything that is a part of our Physical world. Lipton is a Biologist and he discovered that the single cell has a sense of self and even more that it is a part of something greater (the body). In his work with the single cell organism he discovered that it is the membrane of the cell that is the center of the cell's being. Until this discovery it was believed that it was the center of the cell, where the DNA is, that is the critical part of the cell. They experimented with the cell by extracting the center of the cell and the cell continued to exist and to function normally, until it needed something from the DNA. I cannot explain it all here but this point alone makes this book worth reading.The other interesting point that Lipton makes in his book is how slow 'classic science' is responding to the discoveries of the Quantum Mechanics. 'classic science' sees our physical world as a mechanism and that everything is separate. The 'new science' (Quantum Mechanics) is almost the opposite, in that everything is connected and not separate. The idea that our cells are conscious of our body as a whole is evident. When we cut our finger, cells throughout our body responds at some level or another. Cells close to the cut react quickly, other cells respond as well but may not be as extremely, but all of our cells show a level of awareness to the cut. How T-cells become any type of cell that our body needs. The question that is asks is the issue of Cancer - does our cell become disconnected to the awareness of the body and starts to grow out of control because it has lost its connection to the whole. It is a book well worth reading even if it offers more questions than answers."
295,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9129386-stephen-sakuma,1,"Well that was peculiar. This book started as a solid history of many interesting facets of biology. It connects fundamental concepts to the more recent developments but I began to wonder where it was going and how it was going to connect to belief. While describing how cells sense the environment the author makes an analogy to how we perceive our environment and how we are like one big cell. At first I thought this was a very nice analogy. The author says that because cells very autonomously respond to their environment that the genetics of a cell doesn't have any effect on what how it behaves. He says that only 2% of humans can say that their DNA is different in a way that actually causes them to be fundamentally different. That is definitely not true. Many inherited and acquired DNA differences between people change how cells respond to different stimuli and define many aspects of the variations between people. Both of those in turn effect how the rest of the body will react. Believing that mutations in genes will not effect you will not prevent them from actually doing so.A cell cannot think it's way out of cell death and we cannot believe our way out of human death. Cells that are treated with mutagenic treatments (like UV radiation in sunlight) can become cancerous and that cancer can become bad enough that it takes over our body and we die. A positive outlook might improve our chances of survival but so do cancer treatments but neither one is sufficient to actually save us much of the time.That being said, belief and mind states do effect us and that is often undervalued. But we should also avoid the temptation to treat our minds as out of the reach of biology and science. Many diseases will not be solved by thoughts and if they can then you would find real scientific studies on them."
296,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4124026-rommel,5,"I picked up this book after seeing a few short presentation of Dr. Bruce Lipton on youtube that spoke to the power that beliefs have on the reality we each create for ourselves.At the beginning I was apprehensive at picking up a book on biology as I thought I wouldn't understand it, as my background hasn't been in science. However, after watching a few of the you tube videos from the author and reading more and more of the book, the language became almost second nature, almost. The main premise of this book is that we are not our genes. In other words, if your parents had cancer, it does not mean you will have cancer too. According to Bruce, we are our perceptions of our environment, which then turn on the necessary genes to create our personalities and reality. Think of our genes being in a pool and and signals to the environment pulling in whatever genes are necessary for our behaviour and our perception of our experience. He gets into a more deeper explanation of this and how he himself changed his life after this insight came to him after a divorce that left him broke, touring the states with a rock and roll band, and eventually sending him to the Caribean to teach some medical students about biology.This is a book about the discovery that our belief that the Newtonian way of looking at life is not only false but it has been proven to be so. Instead, he offers a more holistic and more optimistic way of looking at life.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand where beliefs come from and how they come about in our biology. Because understanding where they come from may give you the opportunity to change a few that may be limiting your success in life.Good reads! "
297,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,3,"Don't judge this book by its spacey new-age cover. While the metaphysical conclusions at the end may be a little much for some to handle, the parts where Lipton covers some basic science and the picture he paints of cell functioning and genetic control is solid and fascinating. Lipton is an accomplished microbiologist who challenges some of the assumptions that are still typically taught in biology classes but which he suggests have been undermined for years by new research. That is always a lament of those who feel textbooks are behind the curve. This book helps to bring some of these insights, such as the actual role of DNA in the life of the cell, to light for a broader audience. Some of his examples, about the structure and function of the parts of the cell, are even useful to borrow for instructors at the high school and introductory college level. And don't worry, you don't need a degree to read and enjoy this book. Oh, and as for those conclusions at the end, they are more like invitations to new questions. The focus of the book is on the ever-growing growing body of evidence from the biology about the power of epigenetics (beyond the genes) and the interaction of the mind and culture with our biology. Medical anthropologists, people interested in complimentary and alternative medicine, and anyone who is interested in the mind/body or spirit/science kinds of questions should read this book as well. And if it all gets to spacey and weird for you at the end, just let it go. It's a bit of a throwback to the style of many late 19th and early 20th century scientific literature, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
298,0975991477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513908-kathleen,4,"I was expecting another self-help/how-to book in this book- I think that this aspect is there, but it's more subtle than in most self-help books- because the author is making a definite effort to ground his ideas in science and cellular biology. Much (maybe even most) of the book actually comes across as a lesson in cellular biology-- (I would recommend this to anyone who was taking a class in biology or curious about cells-- the author's passion about the subject surpasses any I've read in the field...) As far as the ""miracles"" part of the title, the book only really delves into that at the very end-- and while it supports a thesis of *believing* that belief is a strong agent of healing, it doesn't suggest a clear route of taking advantage of this (except on the very last page, where it mentions a particular ideology: Psych.K, which I have yet to look up-- that's the only time when the book points the reader in a ""direction"" as far as advising you what to do to improve your life/health/etc) Perhaps it's good that the book isn't structured as a how-to, we have so many books like that. Instead, this book is more like the autobiography of a ""mad"" scientist; a seemingly remarkable cellular biologist actually, who came to be a believer in the stunning cohesion between mind and (cellular) matter-- his awe and appreciation of cells and of biology extend to the spiritual, and this approach to science, as well as to spiritual-seeking, I think could benefit many readers. An interesting, different book, and probably one to be read several times, at different stages in life. "
