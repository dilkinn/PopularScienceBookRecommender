0,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"I finished this book and came to the conclusion, the same as the Amish have, if you get someone young enough and you deny them a scientific education they will believe almost anything. In other words, brainwash them young when they don't know the difference between reality and fantasy and the big frightening man that will come and get them if they bite their nails is as real in their heads as their mother or father.Not that you can't brainwash adults though. Look at the 8 glasses of water a day people. Like no one on earth can possibly be healthy if they don't drink that much. They don't take into account that a lot of the world can't get that much clean drinking water in a day and they still manage to live to a ripe old age. They also don't take into account it was an eighties marketing campaign* by Nestle launching their bottled water that started it. Nestle must have laughed, still be laughing, all the way to the bank. *See Bottlemania: How Water Went on Sale and Why We Bought ItAnd so it goes. Promise people this desirable thing and they will buy this supplement, believe that theory, and spend a day screeching their hearts out in a ballroom with cheap chairs and saying the therapy changing their lives. My own personal opinion on religion whether or not it is benign, mildly evil or out and out murderous is that it is all invented by man. Not woman. (There are exceptions I'm sure). I recently read in a book a statement by a Confucian in centuries past. He thought that Confucianism was a beautiful, life-enriching thing with wonderful traditions, so long as you didn't take it too seriously and start imputing anything divine to it.That really applies to any belief that has no basis in fact or science. It might be very personally rewarding, but don't go shouting it is the truth, the only truth and all those who don't believe in it are idiots... or worse._____________Written on reading the book. (view spoiler)[I found this book the same time as I was sent as a recommendation in a friend request from a sock puppet account, the anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist author Texe Marrs's Conspiracy of the Six-Pointed Star: Eye-Opening Revelations and Forbidden Knowledge about Israel, the Jews, Zionism, and the Rothschilds. That man hates Jews so bad it must keep him awake at night. The troll worships this guy, I'm always getting stuff like this from him so I could learn ""the truth"" about my 'race'. You have to laugh in a sort of raised-eyebrow way don't you?If this book is any good I'm going to send it to the troll :-) I know who he really is. (hide spoiler)]"
1,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Like many people, I could hardly believe my eyes when Donald Trump, in the wake of the Orlando shooting, actually went as far as to insinuate that President Obama could in some way have been complicit in causing this appalling hate crime and act of terrorism. The idea is so offensive and absurd that you hardly know where to start. A common reaction has been to point out that, if Obama is on the side of the terrorists, you'd have to explain why he'd want to invest so much effort in killing Osama bin Laden, not to mention authorizing thousands of drone strikes. To me, an even stronger counter-argument is cui bono. Just what hidden agenda would Obama be trying to progress by allowing this hideous crime to happen? But, and I freely admit it, I'm behind the times: conspiracy theory is the new black. I suppose I need to catch up, so let me ask what makes us so sure that Trump is in the clear? Unlike Obama, he has an obvious reason for wanting events like Orlando to happen: they help his campaign, which is largely fuelled by polarizing narratives of ""us"" against ""them"". He was remarkably quick in reacting to the news, and hardly even bothered to express shock or sympathy with the victims before he started harvesting political capital. All in all, he behaved pretty much exactly the way he'd have behaved if he had in fact been behind it.Well, I'm not saying Trump was the guy behind Omar Mateen. But I'm not saying he wasn't either. As you can see, there's a case, and I'd like to hear him deny it in so many words... which, to the best of my knowledge, he hasn't yet done. Suspicious or what?"
2,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"Having spent a fair amount of time on my spiritual path believing things that at best had no evidence and at times were quite outrageous, I’ve become very interested in the question that forms the title of this book. A former born-again Christian who is now head of the Skeptic society, Michael Shermer has written a very readable and compelling exploration of the cognitive thinking errors humans regularly make that support belief in ideas that can often be very detrimental to our overall well-being. Shermer is a good storyteller and his discussions of subjects including the alien abduction phenomenon, the personality cult of Ayn Rand, and the tactics “creation scientists” use to try to discredit the theory of evolution make for compelling reading. Perhaps most importantly, Shermer eloquently argues that being a skeptic is not the same thing as being a cynic. In his description of the scientific process, it becomes clear that maintaining a sense of awe and wonder at the universe is not only compatible with science, it can actually be enhanced by the willingness to remain in the unknown as evidence is being gathered and examined. In addition, a maintaining a healthy skepticism can go a long way towards preserving both one’s sanity and one’s cash in the alternative spiritual realm."
3,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"This guy is in Australia at the moment for Science Week and I was thinking of going to see him, but this is not really a week in which I can engage in such optional behaviours – so, I thought I’d get out one of his books instead.And look, it was very good and if it had been the first book I’d ever read on scepticism (which I think it was written to be) than I really would have been impressed. But it wasn’t the first book I’d read on this subject and so that in itself gave the book a bit of a struggle ahead of itself.Brookmyre’s latest is also on pretty much the same subject, particularly at the start of this one, but the Brookmyre is a much better book – but then, it is a Brookmyre, even if not a terribly funny Brookmyre. Reading this book actually made me reconsider just how good Brookmyre’s last book actually was.There was an odd bit towards the end of this one about the Holocaust – and I really struggled with that being in this book. To compare David Irving and the holocaust deniers with Creationists and the deniers of Evolution – I mean, I can see where he is coming from, but really, of the two, Creationists are the much more dangerous, as they are by far considered the more ‘credible’ by a larger part of society. Only someone with virtually no brain at all could deny the holocaust – it is hard to take that view seriously, so I struggled over this being put in the book. But everyone needs to take Creationism seriously – when the guy with his hand on the big red button calls himself a Creationist and believes in Armageddon, the world really does need to take Creationism more seriously than Holocaust denial.The start of this book is very well put together – he goes through the logical fallacies that people often make when they believe in such things as alien abduction or spiritualism. Even as an introduction to logical fallacies it is worth reading. In fact, I found most of the book well put together. It is just I have read so much on this stuff and so very little here is ‘new’. However, there really was a wonderful bit in the middle where he quotes from Dianetics , quotes my mate L. Ron saying that Dianetics is the greatest human discovery since the wheel. I really am going to have to read that book one of these days. Scientology has got to be the funniest religion around. If the point of religion is to make me smile, then really, compared to Scientology (and perhaps the Latter Days) other religions really aren’t trying.It might be that with this stuff one does tend to go back to the first book one read on the subject – but I still do think that  A Physicist’s Guide to Scepticism by Rothman was a much better book. All the same, this is a book worth reading because it is on a very important topic – while it is still the case that the majority of people in the world believe in ghosts and UFOs there will always be room for yet another book on scepticism. And this one is easy to read and quite comprehensive. "
4,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"This is a joint review of this book and How We BelieveShermer postulates that humans have evolved a belief module that helps us find patterns in what appears otherwise to be a meaningless universe. (Why we feel compelled to find meaning in everything continues to puzzle me.) Until about four hundred years ago, when the process of science gave us a method to determine the difference between patterns that are real and those that are mere illusion, the tautologies myth and religion, (a tautology) explained the relationship of man to the universe. Despite the rise of science, humans continue to hold all sorts of unsupportable beliefs: 90% believe in heaven, 72% believe in angels, 67% believe they have had a psychic experience (Wall Street Journal, January 30, 1996). Mostly we have adopted the fruits of science, i.e. technology, without teaching or employing the principles of scientific thinking. The reason, Shermer suggests, lies in the evolution of the “ module.” Several million years of evolution were required to change the fist-sized brain of Australopithecines to the cantaloupe-sized brain of the Homo sapiens sapiens, and civilization as we understand it has been around for only about 13,000 years. Evolutionary psychologists believe the conditions of our existence shaped the brain. The brain is basically a collection of computational devices that evolved to “solve” problems regularly encountered by our huntergatherer ancestors.” Shermer argues that “belief” evolved to help interpret patterns. Recognition of patterns has survival value, e.g., being upwind of an animal means one is more likely to be discovered, etc. These are meaningful. Other patterns such as drawing images and magical thinking may reduce anxiety but are essentially meaningless or irrelevant from a survival standpoint. In short, we developed two kinds of thinking: type 1, believing a falsehood or rejecting the truth and type 2, not believing a falsehood and believing a truth. Magical thinking evolved as a necessary corollary to causal thinking, a spandrel, if you will. (A spandrel is the space formed by the intersection of two arches — it looks to be structurally essential but are not) between seeking answers through magic, i.e., religion and other nonevidentiary- based beliefs and fact-based conclusions. That magical thinking and making mistakes in order to eventually correctly interpret patterns is undeniable. Shermer cites several examples of superstition and magical thinking among indigenous peoples to support his hypothesis. For example, among the Yanomamö peoples of South America superstitions and taboos related to the Jaguar even when incorrect serve a useful purpose because the jaguar is the only animal that hunts people, and the superstitions help to convey the power and danger of the animal that presents a very real danger. Bronislaw Malinski, in his study of the Trobriand Islanders, found that rituals and superstitions increased as they ventured farther out to sea. He drew the conclusion that thinking derived from environmental conditions finds magic wherever the elements of chance and accident are present. “The emotional play between hope and fear have a wide and extensive range. We do not find magic wherever the pursuit is certain, reliable and well under the control of rational methods and technological processes. . . There are no peoples however primitive without religion and magic.” During the Middle Ages, given the uncertainties and vagaries of daily life, and that almost 90% of the people were illiterate, superstition and belief in magic were ubiquitous. Plague was believed to be caused by a misalignment of the stars, and when a person died, all the water in the house was discarded lest the soul of the departed drown, etc. (For more see Keith Thomas's Religion and the Decline of Magic ""Only religion could rival astrology as an all-embracing explanation for the vicissitudes of life."" The rise of rationalism and science following the sixteenth century did much to replace superstitions as an explanation for the unknown or uncertain. The twentieth century is not immune to superstitious belief, and the more uncertain an activity, the more likely there are to be superstitions associated with it. Take baseball. Hitting a baseball is so difficult that even the best players fail to get a hit seven times out of 10 at bats so many hitters have harmless superstitions associated with their batting. Fielders, on the other hand, who succeed catching a fly ball almost nine times out of ten have few — until they come bat. In France there is a company that provides emergency guests for any dinner party of triskaidekaphobes who discover that they number thirteen at table. Bad things happen to good people, and good things often happen to bad people. Conspiracy theorists are simply trying to bring order to a complex world containing such dissonances. It's a way of bringing order to what appears random. Surely JFK could not have been killed by a lone gunman. It's impossible! (G. Gordon Liddy said that two elements were required for a conspiracy: competence, a rare commodity, and secrecy, a secret can be kept among two people only if two of them are dead.)Almost any kind of bizarre unrelated event then becomes ""evidence"" for the conspiracy. Our belief modules in action. Shermer argues the best ""regulator"" of the Belief Module is science. It is the best method for determining the difference between falsehood and truth. ""Does extract of seaweed really cure cancer? All the anecdotes in the world will not answer the question. You need 100 people, all properly diagnosed as having the same type of cancer. Then have 50 of them eat extract of seaweed and 50 take the placebo."" If none of them knows what they are taking and none of the experimenters knows (double-blind) and the results show a statistically significant difference then you might have something. "
5,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,3,"I don't think I learned why people believe weird things, just that they do (which I already knew).It also mentions how these beliefs don't listen to reason, because that was never the point, but the author also proceeds to tell you how to logically refute every moronic argument of creationists or Holocaust denials. As if the lack of logical counter-arguments was ever the problem.I did enjoy the history of the evolution theory denialism in the US which from the European perspective is really shocking."
6,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,4,"Why People believe weird things is something I have also wondered a lot when I hear people talking about ghosts or astrology or God. Things are different here in India and you wouldn't find people shouting for creationism or Holocaust deniers here as you neither have prominently christian people here and not too many Jewish people but still we in India have our own laundry list of weird things people believe in. It was a fun read and shocking though I already knew that still so many people believe in supernatural stuff despite so many irrefutable proof. YouTube is filled with stupid videos portraying all kind of weird things you will find flatearthers there, aliens and try all kind of conspiracy theories. Everyone should read this and more such books and more people should be skeptics after all that's the call of today and only education and more knowledge can pierce through the darkness of superstition and always remember to just Keep on Reading.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is, of course, Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."
7,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2242165-tyler,1,"There have been enough positive reviews of this book that I'm sure it won't hurt the author's self-esteem if I say this: This book is dumb. It was on my to-read list forever, so maybe my expectations were a little high. But fair warning to anyone planning to read this, it's not what you think it is. It doesn't even address the question in the title directly until a final chapter, which I gather was added after the first edition was published.If you want to read about the history of holocaust denial, that's in here. Or the history of the legal challenge to teaching evolution in schools, that's here. Those are probably the highlights in fact. But the writing is poor, it's disjointed and in need of an editor. It's long-winded and directionless for most of the book. It's ... not what I expected. I like Michael Shermer, don't really have any disagreements with the man. But being a subject matter expert does not make you a writer."
8,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14386596-christopher,3,"Audiobook - Abridged - 3.5 hours-- Note this is not the Revised and Expanded edition (if there even is one for audio). I listened to the original audio from '98.Shermer is the founder of The Skeptics Society and Editor in Chief of its magazine Skeptic. He knows his stuff. In this book, he explores alien abductions, Holocaust denial, the legal history of creationism in science classrooms, and some other things. These are all interesting and covers Shermer's experiences with all of them. My primary trouble with this book is the title. With that title, I expected more psychology and less logic. Shermer spends a great deal of time talking about the various fallacies the various groups make, but doesn't spend enough time, in my view, on the actual why. You all know I'm a huge proponent of reviewing what was written, not what one wanted to read... but 'Why' is in the title. While the 'what' is interesting, I was promised 'why', and answers are in too short of supply. "
9,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,3,"I have read many of Shermer's articles for Skeptics Magazine but this was the first book by him that I've read. It was probably a good one to start out with. He appears to be setting out his basic ideas on why people often lean to unscientific and illogical beliefs. He goes through these reasons and also describes the basis of scientific inquiry well. However he also gives specific examples of pseudo-science and outright erroneous thinking including Holocaust denial, aliens abductions and Creationism. While I enjoyed it, I felt some of this material would have been better in a separate book, especially the chapters on Ayn Rand and objectivism. They appeared to have been Skeptic Magazines essays that were glued together and, in fact, Shermer pretty much admits that in the foreword. Nonetheless, there was some valuable information throughout the book and I recommend it as a essential primer on the difference between science and pseudo-science. Three and a half stars."
10,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/605807-jason,3,"This book seems to hold great promise from the outset. It's a book (as the author would confess) that values reason, science, knowledge and the examination of beliefs. Nothing wrong with that. However, the book seems to ramble on a bit and takes on the feel of the author's personal musings instead of objective examination of the material. A couple of the chapters could be condensed into one chapter that contains more focus and sticks to the topic. For instance, in one chapter Shermer drones on about the diff. aspects of creation-science and real science which is testable. This is great except he lists a myriad of arguments in brief. The only way you could do anything worthwhile with the material intellectually is to dig deeper into other books with more insight on the topic. In other words, you aren't going to reach any conclusions yay or nay with such brief explanations. He discusses holocaust denial in a ""part"" of the book which is fine except a couple of the chapters once again could be condensed since the later chapter seems to rehash much of what was said before only in greater detail. Lastly, the very last chapter which deals with a Dr. Tipler and his fantasy-like Omega Point theory is superfluous. This is Shermer's personal book review of Tipler's physics work. To put it crudely, who really gives a crap except someone with a vested interest in physics? A short description of the weirdness of Tipler's work would have been sufficient. Also, one other gripe; Shermer seems to portray the personal idea that objective science is good and that theories are subject to change over time-""facts are data"". Yet, despite him stating these points I found him more than once claiming evolution as fact. I am not saying that it isn't but am suggesting he should reframe himself to say it's commonly accepted as fact because of such and such testable evidence. Also, Shermer does discuss fringe beliefs somewhat such as; alien abductions, afrocentrism, witch hunts and the like. However, in my opinion he strayed away too much from these interesting topics and went into personal musings about science instead. Anyway, I can see many people giving negative reviews of this book simply because they do not like Shermer's relativistic, hard-science stand. That's no fault of his own though...Finally, I would recommend the book despite its flaws because it is for lack of a better description interesting. It could have been much better but we will have to accept it on merit of the ideas it espouses and not so much for the overall content. "
11,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"Michael Schermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine and a contributing editor of Scientific American. In this book, an update of an earlier version, with a foreword by Stephen Jay Gould, he takes on a number of worthy targets, including:* believers in the paranormal and extra-sensory perception (ESP)* near-death experiences and those who channel ""past lives""* alien abductions* witch-hunting and the recovered memory movement* Ayn Rand and the cult of objectivism* anti-evolutionism and ""creation science""* holocaust deniers and other pseudohistorians* scientific ""proofs"" for the existence of God* assorted conspiracy theories pertaining to aliens and coverupsThe chapters containing the repudiation of these various instances of pseudoscience and pseudohistory form the core of the book. They are flanked by a three-chapter introduction, ""Science and Skepticism"", and two concluding chapters: ""Why do people believe weird things?"" and ""Why smart people believe weird things"".I have read a number of books along the lines of this one (e.g.  Damian Thompson's ""Counterknowledge"" , Robert Park's ""Voodoo Science""). Each triggers a fundamental question - who is the author's intended audience? Scientists, after all, are unlikely to need this kind of primer on logical thinking, and how likely is it that the kind of person who believes in alien abduction, the healing power of crystals, or past-life channeling will actually read this book. Isn't there an element of preaching to the choir that renders this kind of book superfluous? Among the three books mentioned, Schermer's is most effective in addressing this criticism, in my opinion. The particular examples that he considers establish that magical thinking is in no way confined to ""dumb"" people - there are plenty of very smart people on the roster of those who have embraced one kind of pseudoscientific notion or another. His third chapter, ""How Thinking goes Wrong (25 fallacies that lead us to believe weird things)"" and his final chapter, exploring the kind of cognitive errors that smart people may be particularly prone to commit, are particularly valuable. For instance, this overview of mistakes people make when given the task of selecting the right answer to a problem after being told whether particular guesses are right or wrong:A. Immediately form a hypothesis and look only for examples to confirm it.B. Fail to seek evidence to disprove one's current hypothesis.C. Show great reluctance to change one's current hypothesis, even when it is obviously wrong.D. Fail to consider more complex solution strategies in the face of more complicated data.E. Find ""patterns"" where none exist.All the evidence suggests that everyone, even ""smart"" people, is hard-wired to fall into these cognitive traps. Schermer's writing style is clear, lively, if a bit undisciplined at times. His refutation of some of the specific topics, creation science and holocaust denial in particular, is spread over several chapters, and could have been done more concisely. And the inclusion of the chapter on Ayn Rand struck me as being somewhat out of place, though it's always fun to read an articulate smackdown of her ridiculous ""philosophy"". For me, the introductory remarks on science and skepticism, and the final two chapters were the most interesting sections. Nonetheless, the book addresses important questions in a well-written, entertaining manner. I give it a strong recommendation. "
12,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9166582-anna,3,"Why People Believe Weird Things is a meticulously researched and presented deep-dive into the causes and explanations of human irrationality. It probably deserves four stars but I'm leaving it at three because it's easily the most depressing book I've ever read (and there's no way to ""really like"" that). Shermer explains that our brains are hardwired to look for patterns as a way of making sense of our world. Sometimes the patterns we detect are genuine (which we either accept or reject as real), and sometimes they are merely illusions (which we can also either accept or reject as real).This means that every judgement call on a pattern offers two ways to be right and two ways to be wrong. When we accept a pattern as genuine, but it isn't, we are committing a Type 1 error or false positive. For example, we think we hear a wolf and raise the alarm, but there was no wolf. In this case the danger passes without harm and the error has no consequences. On the other hand, if we think what we're hearing isn't a wolf, but it really is, then we are committing a Type 2 error or false negative. In this case, the consequences could be fatal. This in a nutshell is why human beings have a bias for seeing patterns that aren't really there. In survival terms, it pays to be watchful for patterns even if your conclusions are wrong much of the time. It doesn't end there, either. Shermer goes into detail about 25 fallacies that encourage people to believe weird things, including a whole slew of logical and psychological problems that lead inevitably to false conclusions. Shermer is much less interested in what people believe and why, than how they come to believe it. Accordingly, religion plays no real part in this book, except for his systematic debunking of ""creation science"" as just one example of pseudoscience. Similarly, pseudohistorical Holocaust deniers get a proper dressing down for their oblivious rejection of known facts. How should we deal with the many pitfalls that lead us to false thinking? Scepticism is Shermer's proposed solution, in the sense of keeping an open mind and remembering to weigh the facts objectively. This may be more a balm than a solution, given that people are going to bend the facts to better fit their a priori beliefs anyway. All of this leads me to the fascinating subject of fraud which I would have loved to see touched on in this book. Fraud is essentially the art of exploiting and capitalizing on other people's false beliefs. There has never been a time in human history when people were better-educated than today or better-equipped to reason out false beliefs, if they so choose. Nevertheless, fraud abounds because people remain highly gullible. A science-fiction writer makes a bet with a friend that he can get rich starting a religion – and it works. A dishonest quack who stands to make millions by discrediting the MMR vaccine falsifies his research and sets off a public health disaster that could threatens the lives of thousands. Why is it that the bigger and more audacious the fraud, the more vigorously people are willing to defend it? Perhaps that is a subject for another book, one that Shermer would be well-equipped to write."
13,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,2,"The final four pages of the book summarizes why people believe in weird things quite well. Funnily, the other 270-odd pages deal argues in an orthogonal manner to these propositions made by the author himself. Let me elaborate in my own words.The author says that as a culture, we seem to have trouble distinguishing science from pseudo-science, history from pseudo-history and sense from nonsense. He gives the underlying motivations for this shortcoming as follows:1. Atheists and skeptics are butting up against ten thousand years of recorded history and possibly hundred thousand years of evolution in arguing against religion, afterlife, miracles and supernatural phenomena.People believe in them because it is comforting, consoling and makes them feel good, thereby fulfilling a primordial psychological need.2. Weird things often offer immediate gratification, fulfilling yet another human need.3. The world is complex, intimidating and confusing but weird things offer simple answers to our problems. In contrast, science offers complicated reasoning and requires training and effort to work through.4. Scientific and secular systems of meaning and morality have proved relatively unsatisfactory to most people. Without a higher power in the universe, why be moral or ethical? What is the meaning of life then? People prefer the comforting pseudo-scientific answers to these questions than the cold, brutal logic of rationality.Now, if the author concludes that the above reasons are why people believe in weird things, what is the point in writing another 270-odd pages refuting creationism, holocaust denial, the cult of Ayn Rand etc by appealing to scientific reason? By his own admission, science is cold and brutal and in contrast, most people want simple, comforting answers to our existential questions. To me it looks as though I can sum up the book in one sentence that ' people believe in weird things because they are unscientific and irrational'. The title of the book was attractive to me, which is why I wanted to read and learn from the book. But I was disappointed because the issues which are dealt with are mostly weird things on the fringe rather than in the mainstream, except for one chapter which deals with a more prevalent notion of the 15-point difference in IQ between white and black Americans as an evolutionary trait. Arguments against holocaust denial and creationism are elaborated over many chapters and I found them rambling and uninteresting because the author's argument can be summed up as 'it is unscientific to deny the holocaust or believe in creationism'. The same goes for the chapter on Ayn Rand and how her appeal to rationalism through her philosophy of Objectivism eventually led to a weird 'cult of personality'. The author quotes Martin Gardner and Carl Sagan in his book, both of whom I admire very much. However, I was surprised to find that Martin Gardner endorsed this book as follows: ...'Michael Shermer's brilliant, informed, and incisive dissections of bogus science and history are a major contribution..."". It makes me even more skeptical than ever about endorsements and reviews of a book on its back flap!"
14,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59737478-amine,3,"Interesting read, enlightening a bit.The book does answer the question, to a satisfying degree at least.The weird things referred to are mainly: psychics, aliens, creation, holocaust denial, but many others are mentioned. The author provides arguments against those things and refutation to the arguments for them, relying on critical thinking and science.Honestly, I was not very satisfied with this book, as I somewhat expected more. The information presented is not mindbending or hard to wrap your head around, it should not be a mystery why people believe weird things, yet with so many people involved, one gets to thinking there must be something bigger to it, I am starting to think there isn't and I just think too much of people. (personal note)I also was not fond of the method the author uses, this book is more for people who do not believe in weird things than for those who do. Above that, this book does not provide raw material as much as it makes use of it, kind of gives you the fish instead of teaching you how to fish.On a more positive note, the material and the examples employed are highly valuable and deserve taking note of.The philosophy of skepticism promoted by the author seems to be promising and useful, and one of which I, as well as many others I bet (and hope), have stumbled into unintentionally. It is not so radical or counterintuitive, it touches upon the core of philosophy and science, yet it is very underrated, especially nowadays.Will this book enrich you with information and arguments? definitely. Will it stop you from believing weird thing? maybe."
15,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,4,"Why People Believe Weird Things is kind of a modernistic blend of Martin Gardner’s pioneering Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science and Carl Sagan’s masterpiece, The Demon-haunted World. Author and prominent skeptic Michael Shermer begins with a recollection of his own conversion from evangelical Christian to skeptic, and generalizes from his personal experiences in an overview of the difference between science and pseudoscience/superstition starring the 25 Fallacies That Lead Us To Believe Weird Things, a somewhat more technically oriented version of Sagan’s famous Baloney Detection Kit.Shermer briefly discusses several of the usual suspects in pseudoscience—ESP, alien abductions and medieval witch hunts—and devotes considerable attention to two topics of current importance: creationism and historical revisionism, the latter with special emphasis on Holocaust denial. While the rotten corpse of creation “science” has been picked clean (see, for example, Why Darwin Matters: The Case against Intelligent Design by the same author; or, for a quicker read, Science Evolution and Creationism published by the National Academy of Sciences), Holocaust denial is not that commonly covered in general books on skepticism, and should be. Shermer, who has studied Holocaust revisionism in depth, going so far as to interview (politely) the principal deniers, takes this “weird thing” as a teaching example in why we should believe the Holocaust was as horrific and deadly as is claimed by mainstream historians. The trick, he explains, is to see how numerous lines of evidence, though none are complete and all may not be perfectly consistent (and we’d suspect them if they were), converge on a common historical narrative. It is also important to pay attention to the tactics the deniers use to cast false doubt, as they all show evidence of flawed reasoning. Though Shermer doesn’t make too much of it, there is an obvious parallel between the cumulative processes of science and history, and between the approaches of creationists and Holocaust deniers, respectively, to discredit them.This book, with its somewhat different point of view and selection of topics, nicely complements The Demon-haunted World as a general guide to critical thinking. Or, in the words of Penn and Teller, “How about you buy this book? It’s a great real. It’s funny, it’s smart, and it’ll be really hip not to be a credulous nut and the world will be a better place.”"
16,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,5,"I have always felt like the books I read intertwine themselves into my memories of that point in my life, but this book, more than any other, stands out as one that isn't just a part of my experience in a time and place but a book that actually changed how I think and view the world, in a meaningful way. Why People Believe Weird Things is a great first book for exploring the basics of critical thinking and gives one a chance to see real life examples of how faulty reasoning can lead one to fallacious conclusions. While some of the examples are so fringe as to be comical, they are no less illustrative of where reasoning can go awry. Recognizing the flawed justifications in these examples can also help one recognize them in as yet unexplored topics. I spent much of my teens, straight through my college years, studying books on tarot, astrology, ESP, ghosts, and any other sort of magical thinking. At the time, I thought this would give me control and power over my world. To understand how the lines on my hands would predict my future would be my opportunity to better respond to what life had coming my way. And yet, time and again, I found myself incapable of understanding and applying what I had read; found conflicting answers in books on the same topic and I saw this as a reflection of my own short comings and inability to grasp the concepts not as a limitation of the theories themselves.This first foray into skepticism and critical thinking taught me that there is no understanding in magic, no answers to my love life in the alignment of stars. Pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and untestable hypotheses do nothing to help us better understand our lives and cannot give us no control over our world. It’s been over a decade since I read this book and I feel like there is more wonder and awe in understanding the testable physical and rational world around me than there ever was in outdated and fallacious thinking. To understand, to question and to think critically is to better appreciate the world around us, and for me, this was a life changing discovery."

Who could argue against the evidence for evolution? And how do smart people believe such outlandish claims as ESP, alien abductions, and haunted houses? In his book, Michael Shermer explains the logical fallacies and cycles of belief that cause smart people to believe some really weird stuff. This book is worth reading for the in-depth discussion of logical fallacies alone; these fallacies should be taught in high school science classes. Shermer points out that part of the issue with pseudoscience is the way we approach science eduction: as a collection of facts, instead of an imperfect but self-correcting method for discovering the truth.Shermer treats believers kindly: he does not attack them as ignorant or crazy. Indeed, he claims that intelligence and belief in weird things are completely orthogonal (in other words, statistically unrelated). However, he does compare creationists with holocaust deniers (both fringe groups that use similar tactics to deny a well-established truth), and he certainly counts a belief in God, particularly a belief that God can be proven scientifically, as strange. Shermer's discussion of Ayn Rand's cult of objectivism is amusingly vitriolic, and one of my favorite sections of the book."
18,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7408040-mark-hartzer,4,"As much as I liked this book, I can't give it a full 5 star review because it is too dated. Yes, 'holocaust denial' folks are pretty much a fringe idiot band, but that was a long time ago comparatively speaking. There is nothing about global warming whatsoever. Nor is there anything about ""Scientology"". This is not to say this book is not worthwhile. It is. I'm afraid it is difficult to keep up with the various crackpot things with our ratings driven media, but i would enjoy an updated version of this book very much. "
19,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16676291-celena-o-brien,4,"	“Why People Believe Weird Things” by Michael Shermer is a primer on skepticism, written by an author whose once strong religious faith, gave way to down right dubitation. Shermer does his best to explain why people have the propensity to believe in things that cannot be proven (alien abductions, ghosts), and others that can be proven but are controversial such as holocaust denial, repressed memories, and psychic powers.	 His third chapter “How Thinking Goes Wrong,” points out 25 ways in which the average person can be deceived into believing the unbelievable. This can take the shape of anecdotal evidence,unscientific testing of the paranormal (after the fact reasoning, rationalization for failing to prove the theory etc.) 	Although this chapter and the others in the book are full of useful information it is sometimes hard for the laymen to keep up with all of the different theories of skepticism. I found myself looking up some of them in more detail (like the Hume's Method) in order to understand the concept accurately. I did the same thing for other chapters, like chapter eight on the cult of objectivism. Shermer covers the basics of this topic but I found it lacking in enough detail to understand it fully. 	To my surprise I found this book relatively free of bias. Of course Shermer is trying to argue is point, but he does not do so at the expense or the humiliation of the believers. He makes a point to say that an attack on creationism is not an attack on religion. Instead he has a problem with people who are trying to deny science at all costs to the benefit of their belief. He also, rightfully so, has a few choice words for holocaust deniers and those that believe in race superiority. I think those topics are rooted in something else entirely different from beliefs in ghosts and religion, so he goes at them with a different approach. 	All in all I found this book to be a good jumping off point to the field of skepticism. It is a relatively unbiased and thought provoking view on the beliefs that many people hold. He tries to explain the etiology of these beliefs, but probably should have limited it to a few topics so the reader does not have to do so much extra research. I would recommend this book to believers and nonbelievers alike. "
20,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112-scott-lerch,5,"This book helped me understand why there are so many people in the world that believe creationism, ESP, ghosts, UFOs, and other supernatural phenomena, and most importantly, why normal intelligent people will believe these weird ideas. After this book and Shermer's subsequent books I began to solidify my scientific worldview, and why I only accept naturalistic explanations. I became a skeptic and learned to truly question everything, but still hold on to provisional truths in science because of my new found respect and understanding for the scientific process."
21,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/675194-peter,4,"I picked up this book a few years ago, but just started reading it. I wanted a better understanding of how people can believe in certain things such as creation-science, but then deny other phenomena such as climate change. The author does a good job discussing how cults gain popularity, and how pseudoscience and pseudo-history are perpetrated. In light of today's hype of ""alternative facts"", and fake news, this book underscores the ever-growing importance of critical thinking. "

A no-holds-barred assault on popular superstitions and prejudices, with more than 80,000 copies in print, Why People Believe Weird Things debunks these nonsensical claims and explores the very human reasons people find otherworldly phenomena, conspiracy theories, and cults so appealing. In an entirely new chapter, ""Why Smart People Believe in Weird Things,"" Michael Shermer takes on science luminaries like physicist Frank Tippler and others, who hide their spiritual beliefs behind the trappings of science.Shermer, science historian and true crusader, also reveals the more dangerous side of such illogical thinking, including Holocaust denial, the recovered-memory movement, the satanic ritual abuse scare, and other modern crazes.

23,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232044-fraser,4,"I had been meaning to read this book for years, but have finally got around to it after reading the social media rantings of an acquaintance against Bill Gates and vaccines. I found myself less interested in “debating” the well-established benefits of vaccines than in understanding the actual reasons WHY someone would believe the things this guy believes, against almost all credible evidence and logic. I’ve read lots on critical thinking and common fallacies, but still feel confused when seemingly intelligent, rational individuals sprout off conspiracy theories, then dig in their heels when presented evidence that counters their beliefs.While Shermer’s book does touch on reasons for belief systems, a disproportionate amount of space is given to the actual debunking of specific various pseudoscientific and pseudo historic claims. While these forays into absurdities make for interesting reading, I don’t need to be convinced that the Earth is more than 10,000 years old or that the Holocaust actually happened. A more pressing question is why are flat-earthers and chemtrail believers suddenly a thing?I think this book was published in 1996 and while the psychology insights into personality traits and fallacious reasoning perhaps haven’t changed much, any modern treatise on the subject needs to examine the role the Internet (and more specifically social media) has played in faulty belief systems."
24,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51588923-shhhhh-ahhhhh,4,"This is a good book but I wish the author had not injected quite so much of his personal beliefs into it. He follows the trope of the wounded believer, someone who was once fully into a poorly supported belief or system of belief and, upon being disabused of that illusion, became somewhat irrationally skeptical. I say this because, though his reasoning generally seems sound, he has closed himself off to understandings of certain practices as something more than woo, sometimes in cases where that position is non-controversial in the discipline that studies it (myths, for example). So, in regards to him being a typical skeptic, Shermer isn't my favorite. This book, however, does an excellent job despite that element of his own worldview being wrapped inside of his arguments. What did he get right? A lot. He led off early in the book critiquing people's beliefs, but not only those of 'true believers' but also of people who has allowed their skepticism to grow to unruly proportions, requiring exorbitant proof of everything. He was spot on in identifying libertarianism as a cult of personality. Also, I didn't know that it was a real cult that dissolved. Modern libertarians tend not to include that part in their discussion of Rand's work, if they know about it at all. He's spot on in debunking the shifting goalposts of creationists in their strategic attack on the education system. Also, i had no idea that that's where Gish Gallup originated. His section defining science is spot on, and a bit of science history that I was unaware of. It would do people well to know it, which is why I'll be including it in this review. His entire section on holocaust deniers is pure gold and remains useful in dealing with antiseminitism and ethnonationalism on the internet today. His arguments about altered states of consciousness are unfortunate, especially in the wake of the wealth of data we have about things like synaptic cross-talk during peak flow experiences or when on psychedelics. Shermer goes on to examine claims regarding dubious beliefs, such as in psychic power, and how the people encouraging these beliefs are pulling the seemingly supernatural tricks that they are. The definition of science from the amicus curae used to defend the US against creationism in 1986: ""Science is devoted to formulating and testing naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena. It is a process for systematically collectingand recording data about the physical world, then categorizing and studyingthe collected data in an effort to infer the principles of nature that bestexplain the observed phenomena."" Next, the scientific method is discussed,beginning with the collection of ""facts,"" the data of the world. ""The gristfor the mill of scientific inquiry is an ever increasing body of observationsthat give information about underlying 'facts.' Facts are the properties ofnatural phenomena. The scientific method involves the rigorous, methodicaltesting of principles that might present a naturalistic explanation forthose facts""Do recommend. "
25,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,3,"Michaels Shermer is my favorite skeptic - I've been reading his column in ""Scientific American"" for years and years. Only lately have I discovered that he has written books as well. I don't know where I've been. Sadly a whole book of Shermer so far hasn't been as astute and to the point as his columns generally are. I'm still not quite sure what to think of this. The basic point can be summed up in one sentence though: ""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons"" (p. 283). I learned this from ""the Believing Brain"" as well. There is a chapter on how thinking goes wrong and then there is an exploration in various misconceptions some people hold. Such as cults, alien abductions, creationism and Holocaust deniers. Whereas the first topics are quite interesting in themselves, Shermer lost me with the Holocaust deniers. I've heard about them, but not much. Perhaps there were more of them at the time this book was written. Of course this is an important thing, but nonetheless it felt slightly out of place with the other topics. I hardly think this book will sway anyone who is not a sceptic. ""As James Randi says, believers in the paranormal are like 'unsinkable rubber ducks'"" (p.72). What I found most interesting was the trial of evoultion vs. creationism in part three of the book. This little tid-bit of information is something I had entirely missed: that there was an act 590 passed in Arkansas that ""creation-science"" should be given equal time in class rooms as evolution. Although this was ruled against, it was brought up in Louisiana and brought to the supreme court. Science won, just. However, that such a thing could go to court at all comes from the vast majority of lay people believing in some sort of creationism (87%)whereas most scientist are in the 9% of the population who believe that God had no part in the development of life on earth. Having brought up Christian but seeing no cause for an either-or argument, I was well into adulthood before I really saw why evolution would be a problem for religion. After all, it wasn't a problem for me. Blaming evolution for all the evils in society - as some ultra-right Christians do - is still mind boggling and new to me. The earth wasn't a more moral place before Darwin. Who was a pastor, by the way. Anyway, besides this fascinating plunge into ultra-right thinking, I didn't get much out of this book that I didn't know before. "
26,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2269105-michael-p,3,"This is a good book and is probably worth your time, but I hoped for more, that more being subjects that Shermer leaves out. The weird things covered are the ravings of Edgar Casey and his followers, near-death experiences, alien encounters, literal witch hunts, Ayn Rand and the cult of Objectivism, Intelligent Design, Holocaust denial, and those who claim that physics prove the existence of one god or another. This is a lot of subjects, but there are few stranger beliefs than Scientology or Mormonism, yet Shermer does not mention them. He does not investigate the miracles of Jesus as revealed in the New Testament or the pesudopigraphia. There is a lot he does not examine.I might be less inclined to make an issue of this, but the longest sections in the book are about Intelligent Design and Holocaust denial, about 125 of the 278 pages, nearly half the book. Does Holocaust denial really need three chapters and 75 pages, especially when one of the chapters is mostly biographies of the leading deniers? Shermer’s exposures of the failings in their arguments are devastating to their cause once he finally gets to them, but it takes him a long time to get to them. I too often found myself wishing that Shermer would get to the point and leave room for some of the topics he skips. One section I wish was longer was his not-really critique of Ayn Rand. He does convincingly demonstrate that Objectivism is a failed philosophy in some of its clams and that Rand and her followers fit the criteria of a cult if you leave the religious criteria out of it, but in the end he agrees with a lot of what Objectivism teaches and so does not challenge some of its tenants such as laissez faire capitalism. In a political climate in which many hold this as one of the highest cultural and political goods, as I write a Vice-Presidential candidate is controversially a Rand follower, it would have been beneficial to readers had Shermer questioned the efficacy of either capitalism or capitalism in its laissez faire form. The latter is a weird thing worth debunking even when Schemer wrote.I’ve tried to give a realistic appraisal of this book so that you may make an informed decision as to whether or not you should read it. What Shermer does well, he does very well. Some of the book might have been done better."
27,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5382558-caitlin-bronson,4,"In my head, I've been a skeptic for a while but in my heart, I've always looked at skeptics as a bunch of humorless buzzkills. Michael Shermer's book didn't completely alleviate that, but he makes a pretty stirring defense of skepticism as both a desirable personal attribute and a worldview. He explains the methodology of science and skepticism and then spends each chapter debunking a particular ""weird"" belief, pointing out how various inputs and desires can cause thinking to ""go wrong,"" leaving popular deception as the logical output.I enjoyed the book quite a bit, and bought into Shermer's arguments on the whole--but I don't quite understand why he chose to include the weird beliefs he did. Given that his primary thesis is that skepticism is a valid protection against harmful and manipulative ideologies, it's odd to me that he chose to include basically innocuous beliefs like ESP and alien abductions alongside the more seriously harmful young earth creationism, Holocaust denial, and Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy. For me, that kind of content-neutral analysis made the tone a little uneven and undercut the book's impact somewhat.Overall, though, I'm definitely converted to skepticism as a way of life (even if it is still fun to tell ghost stories, talk about urban legends, or hunt for Big Foot in the woods late at night). I'd love to see an update now that we're 20 years further into the Information Age and just lived through a resurgence of fake news, alternatives facts, and willful mistrust."

This book changed my life in that it allowed me to understand, maybe for the first time, why people think what they think; and how to differentiate between ""thinking"" and ""believing."" This book details the human thought process and how people interact with ideas and why, tragically, we believe stupid, stupid things.The book attacks the ""repressed memories"" movement, explaining not only why the method was garbage, but why it was so persuasive for so long. It also discusses the ""hysteria"" loop and why its so... common. But the most telling sections are on religion loops and the thought process of Holocaust denial. regardless of the subject, the underpinning is WHY people think what they think and how we catch ourselves in avoiding those pitfalls. I cannot do this book justice, but it is simply the most important book I have read in my young adult life. It changed the way I looked at concepts, ideas and the vulgar idea of people who say such trash as ""Well I believe X so its how I live."" A few months after I read the book, we elected a man who lived his life saying ""I believe what I believe and that's it."" And George W. Bush proved that EVERYONE should read this book so we never elect another dimwit like that. "

I wasn't happy with just accepting I had made mistakes, but wanted to know how and why I had fallen into believing so many incredibly strange things. IT was the title alone I think that lead me to getting this book, but holy hell was it illuminating. It lays out in pretty plain language how our thought patterns can easily be fooled, and ways to perhaps be on guard. After reading this I read more works by Shermer and eventually started subscribing to Skeptic magazine (which he edits). Through that found many other authors, web sites, and pod casts that can all be described as part of the skeptic community. All of which has had a huge impact on my life, especially in helping me keep an eye on my ""fantasy prone personality"". I never want to be in a place where my thinking can be so off, so ""weird"" that it leads me to making the kind of mistakes I've made in the past, and skepticism brings so many tools to the table to help me prevent that.All of which I would have never found if it had not been for this wonderful little book."
30,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,4,"This author makes a strong case for skepticism. The strongest case he makes, I believe, isn't so much in the dispelling of popular beliefs that have little evidence, but in his attitude toward them. Skeptics have a bad reputation (sadly, often earned) for being naysaying, closed-minded curmudgeons with no imagination.This author is a refreshing example of true skepticism, which he summarizes in a quote by Baruch Spinoza: ""I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them."" True skepticism is about curiosity, questioning, seeking evidence for claims that are made, rather than accepting them on faith or hope alone. The author even insists in several places that there's also a place for faith and hope, but they're insufficient for scientific reasoning.This book discusses several fascinating, popular beliefs and cults, dispelling claims that lack evidence, or that have contrary evidence. It includes discussions of holocaust deniers, alien abduction, paranormal phenomenon, creationism, mind reading, racism, the misuse of science to prove religious beliefs, even the Ayn Rand cult of personality."

It's very easy to mock weird beliefs but why do people believe in such things, given the lack of any sort of evidence? More pertinently why do otherwise smart, well educated people believe in weird things? This book presents a study of different areas of pseudo science and examines how each belief gains credence through a feedback loop of self reinforcement. One particularly interesting chapter looks at how the objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand - surely the last word in coldly rational self interest - turned into a self destructive personality cult in defiance of all logic.Shermer explains the principles of scientific and sceptical thought, with the important point that scepticism is a method not a position. Another important chapter deals with the confirmation bias - the tendency to look for evidence that supports an existing belief and to ignore anything that contradicts it - which is why the scientific process of peer review and evaluation is so important in rooting out bad science. I would recommend this book as an excellent introduction to sceptical and critical thinking."

There are also chapters examining the scientific method and logical errors, as well as the closing chapters on why seemingly intelligent people can fall into the trap of a weird belief. This text comes at what I believe to be a critical moment in the history of humanity (aren't they all though?). At a time where there is so much misleading, unsupported, and questionable claims uncritical thinking is the modus operandi for the television/video game consuming mass.

33,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"Why People Believe Weird Things is a great introduction to the cognitive psychology of beliefs. Even 17 years after this book was originally published, the core concepts explained by Shermer are still fascinating and relevant. A lot of it is somewhat depressing (it would have pleased me more to hear about how culture is moving away from pseudoscience, even if that's not happening) or frustrating (the entire section on the Holocaust deniers), but why people believe weird things - and why they are unwilling to change thier belief system even when it doesn't make logical sense and/or is not factual - is in my experience a somewhat depressing and frustrating topic. Nonetheless, I thought Shermer approached the topic in a clear and concise manner. This is definately a book that I would reccomend. (Though whether I would reccomend it over his subsequent books, such as The Believing Brain, remains to be seen. I'm reading his books in chronological order and I haven't gotten to that one yet.)"

36,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"Biases: blank slate tendencies towards IQ and gender, liberal, ignoring genetics, bad psychology science overall, overly holistic in his view on psychology and uses anecdotes to ""prove"" pointsWhat I feel overall:It's mainly a fine intro to his personal gang of skeptics and how they think about the world. But after seeing the 10th factually wrong study and conclusion in the book it started to diminish in value in my mind. Outdated science is still bad no matter why it's outdated. Besides the 3/10 psychology in the book, it's not a bad read at all. But it won't tell you anything about why superstition thinking exists or what skepticism is overall. He just doesn't dive into these topics. The book is mainly good anecdotes from the field and a good sales pitch for his own group.Pro:Shermer has a lot of personal anecdotes from being featured on TV shows, running his skeptic magazine and being a holistic thinker believing in or trying alternative remedies to get ahead. All that is interesting and engaging in many ways. Especially the first 200 pages are great and interesting and maybe a 8/10. When he describes his own experiences he seems to have a clear head and tells the story from a semi-neutral point of view but of course with himself as the hero of the stories where he fights superstitious people.Con:The main problem with this book is that it keeps a holistic view on things even when it comes to well-known facts. Lots of the psychology experiments he refers to are very much outdated and have long since been disproven. Of course back then we believed a lot of silly things about the human mind but I still have to be critical of this stuff no matter what dated it. Shermer has a very outdated psychology mind and he just mentions experiments without understanding why they may be good or bad studies. I can't mention all the bad science in the book but I'll go into some of it.He is a proponent of birth order theories and uses them to create an argument for some of his main points. Which of course falls apart if the critical reader looks into the field and sees how weak or lacking these results are. Then he also very often uses personal anecdotes to prove his cases. There is, for example, a part where he says that experiments show that women are more superstitious than men. While he tends to overuse experiments to explain everything he just refuses to believe this specific group of studies. He dismisses the experiments by telling about his personal experiences on the matter that go against these findings. So yet again he uses anecdotes to make a case but this time he feels that the anecdotes are strong enough to dismiss data.Also, he talks about a cut-off IQ number for creativity where creativity just stops following IQ increases after 125 IQ points. That's silly. That one has been disproven a long time ago and at any rate it's nonsensical and doesn't follow any clear evolutionary psychology line of thinking. And he has a ton of such weird statements that even a first-year psychology student would scoff at as even basic modern textbooks dismiss them as outdated thinking and bad experiments. Shermer, on the other hand, uses psychology science as a crutch to support any statement or argument he may have without illustrating how the experiment was done or why the mind might work that way. He just finds anything he can to create his engaging holistic stories. Critical? Not really. Skeptical? Not at all. At least he could have clearly named the experiments so that readers could easily look into the science.In the IQ and race chapter he not only is wrong but he is not even wrong in a right way. He dismisses any heritable race differences as according to him races are not real so ergo there is no difference between races. This is just extremely outdated thinking and a logical fallacy that's on the lower spectrum of silly. Today we even make medicine for certain races and there are races that are better adapted to avoid certain illnesses like malaria or races that have a higher chance of having heritable illnesses. At any rate inborn intelligence differences are found and they don't depend on there being races or not. But his logic stops at this gate. If races don't exist, according to him, then IQ and heritability are suddenly not issues he feels need to be answered anymore. Even though that's the very thing the chapter is about!But at any rate, even discounting the IQ chapter the book is very much outdated. One very long chapter is the chapter on Holocaust denialists. Now, I have heard of such people. But I have never met such a person and never even seen them online even though I know anti-Semitic weirdos are everywhere. It just feels weird to spend this many pages on a topic that only has a few weirdos believing in it. Shermer himself uses anti-Holocaust denial arguments that also feel hollow. Like the story about him finding KZ photos that denialists claimed were manipulated. By looking at them he concluded that they were not in any way manipulated but were, in fact, original photos. He never explains how he spotted that or how kind of photo expert he is. There is also some bad science in this chapter too. The Holocaust denier poll has long since been shown to be factually wrong and a critical mind can see that it's wrong just by looking at the huge numbers that make no logical sense.The creationist chapter also ran long. It's just that people like Richard Dawkins have already explained all that stuff in more engaging ways. So his chapter on creationists feels outdated too. Besides that creationism is not as strong a force today. As it doesn't really carry the same emotional weight anymore which makes the chapter feels irrational and panicky. He also never even mentions any other religion critically. I'm not sure why that is but it feels like he is on a mission to attack very specific groups only. The Ayn Rand chapter feels the same way. So does the IQ chapter. He uses personal attacks to illustrate why all those people are silly and wrong. It's one too many personal attacks especially when they take the center stage in several chapters.Then there is the whole Stephen Jay Gould thing. Apparently they were friends and the book is written at a time where social constructivists saw Gould as their cult-leader. Since then academics had time to research his findings and find holes in his arguments and data. He is today still remembered as an amazing storyteller, but then also a pseudoscientist. Today his name is synonymous with bad science and he is the go-to example when people talk about problems in social science and biases conclusions.Also, the whole Skeptic(TM) thing comes off as cultish. Shermer used to be a Christian and used all the alternative medicine he could find when he was an athlete. Now he writes about selling magazines and creating a following. It's not a cult but it does feel like some sort of personality cult at least.ConclusionIt's a decent intro to skepticism with a ton of great points and clear writing. The writing alone will engage academic readers not too afraid of tackling long arguments.The outdated psychology is what I feel iffy about here. That's the only science I know anything about so if that part is crap I assume he maybe got some of the other science wrong too? I'm not knowledgable enough to look critically at his math or descriptions of physics experiments.I can't recommend this book but if you do read it you'd probably enjoy it for most parts. If you have not studied psychology you may not even notice that there is something truly wrong with it. If you have studies psychology you may just not care about people misusing science. At any rate, I think most people are not critical enough to dislike such a book just for the crappy science alone."
37,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12447371-john-dolan,0,"It was difficult for me to assign a star rating to Michael Shermer’s book. (Not that we should necessarily ascribe too much value to star ratings anyway – it’s the review that counts, right? Well, maybe.)‘Why People Believe Weird Things’ is divided up into five sections. The first two sections and the fifth section are excellent, dealing with science and skepticism, pseudoscience and superstition, and an analysis of why weird concepts find a place in the human mind – even in the brains of ‘smart’ people.Sections three and four, however, which deal respectively with evolution vs creationism and Holocaust denial, IMHO add little to the book. For sure, these are important subjects, but I felt the author went off-piste here from his original subject, giving us long expositions on the arguments for and against the various positions: and these pages comprise over a third of the book.Nevertheless, this is still a book worth reading. There is gold to be mined."
38,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1371376-leah,3,"I enjoyed this book, but with a few qualifications. To start, the book should perhaps be titled, ""Some of the Weird Things People Believe,"" since the book doesn't really get into *why* people believe the things they do. With that caveat, I did enjoy the book for the most part.The author's central premise is to apply scientific or logical reasoning to some of the more well-known fringe beliefs in the US/Europe. If a fringe belief system calls itself scientific or uses the discourse of science/logic, Shermer's belief is that they should be open to being evaluated with the same measuring stick. He makes a big point that he's not trying to poke any holes in religious belief or faith. Rather, he underlines (several times) that religion and faith have nothing to do with science and reason, and that one can happily enjoy both logic and faith.The first section of the book is a good nutshell introduction to logical and scientific reasoning, with some tidbits of the history of scientific inquiry thrown in.The second section deals with creationism, or more specifically, ""creation science."" Shermer makes another big point that he doesn't have any bones to pick with creation beliefs. In fact, he outlines several other belief systems in the world with a similar creation myth to that of Christians. His problem is with ""creation scientists,"" those who purport to use science and the scientific method to position their religious beliefs in the scientific community.The third section of the book deals with Holocaust deniers. I found this fascinating, since I didn't realize this really existed. Again, because the deniers use the discourse of historical, logical inquiry, Shermer felt that they should be subject to an evaluation based on the same principles.Other sections in the book include an analysis Ayn Rand and the cult of objectivism and fortunetellers/psychics. Clearly, Shermer's expertise is in creationism and Holocaust denial. These two sections occupy 2/3 of the book. And this is one of the weak points, I think. The other chapters are tacked on, almost as afterthoughts by a publisher who thought that the creationism/deniers weren't enough for a book on their own. I also suspect publishers in the unfortunate title. Shermer knows a lot about creation ""science"" and Holocaust denial, as well as the actual scientific facts about the origins of human life, and the Holocaust. Those two sections are the most compelling of the book, since his expertise comes out strongly.Though it's beyond control of the author, the printing and publishing is also sub-par."
39,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1909118-ami,3,"Reading this immediately after a book on God & prayer is either the best idea or the worst idea. My brain feels like it's melting.*Well, after having read it, I can say that I appreciated the section on pseudoscience & Creationism, especially the author's assurance that science & religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. He states that they fill different niches in the psyche, so there's use for both of them, and that in his opinion, agnosticism is the most scientific approach. So that was cool. And also, he really ripped creation ""science"" a new one, and documented the 1985 Supreme Court trial to keep creationism out of public schools. There was a similarly relatively-engaging section on pseudohistory and Holocaust deniers. Unfortunately, the book ended with sort of a confusing muddle of physics & cosmology & this guy who is trying to use the eventuality of time travel to prove the existence of God & the Resurrection (I think?). It was waaaay too technical and I just couldn't follow most of it.The whole book could at times seem just a touch more technical than necessary or enjoyable for the common reader, and I had to dust off the fuzzy old bachelor's degree memories to understand parts of it. I guess I felt like my brain did a bunch of sit-ups, and I feel good about it afterwards, but it wasn't always enjoyable while I was reading. The author was mostly an interesting guy, and mostly an engaging writer, although not completely engaging. Somewhat engaging. 2.5-3 stars."
40,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1928100-stringy,3,"An excellent primer on some common weird beliefs and the reasons people get started believing in them. Several reviews here have said that Shermer doesn't get into the reasons *why*, but I think this was more than adequately dealt with. There's a chapter on cognitive errors, broken up into sections on scientific errors, pseudo-scientific errors, logical fallacies and psychological biases. Each major section (paranormal experiences, pseudo-science, witch hunts, pseudo-history, etc) explains the motivation and methods of maintaining the belief in spite of disapproval from the believer's peers. Shermer concludes this edition with a new chapter on how research shows that weird beliefs have nothing to do with intelligence, and are much more closely related to psychological traits such as openness, conscientiousness, perception of control, and so on. I found the information on Holocaust deniers fascinating, as I hadn't looked into it much before. The witch hunt/Satanic panic section was also good, although I'd love to see an updated version. I skimmed the pseudo-science section as I was quite familiar with those topics already, having read books specifically about them. I also would have liked the cults section to deal with more 'traditional' cults than Objectivism, but perhaps Shermer covers that in his later book on religions. This is a great book for people beginning to learn about skepticism. Long-time skeptics will most likely have read in-depth on their areas of specific interest already, so would be less likely to get a lot out of it. "
41,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2143854-walter,4,"This book is a very intriguing one: at times it's compelling, at times it's too timid, but, overall, it's an enjoyable experience. Michael Shermer is a professor and the leader of Skeptic Magazine (and, in effect, is the leading skeptic in our country). His basic thesis - that we should ask questions/challenge assumptions in order to understand our world and each other - is here applied to some of the more unique beliefs and concepts to which many hold like creationism/Intelligent Design, witchcraft, race/racism, etc. On the whole, Shermer does a good job of investigating the several sides to each issue and, most of the time, offers a reasonable and reasoned assessment of the situation.The major fault in the book, in my view, is the few times that he does not offer an opinion. In those situations it feels like he just chickened out and they contrast so completely to the sections where his assessments are illuminating, witheringly reasonable and uplifting.This being said, I recommend this book to those who are interested in true understanding. I may not agree with Shermer all of the time, but I do appreciate that he is willing to investigate/listen to multiple sides of various issues in an effort to understand the realities underneath. This is a valuable service to us all, as debunking myths and the often pernicious (and politically motivated) causes and their cardinal ideas is a function too little appreciated and greatly (and permanently) needed."
42,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10173983-pat,3,"Despite a title, foreword, introduction, prologue, and blurb which would all seem to indicate a rather precise and well defined purpose, Shermer's book never really gets around to discussing why people believe weird things. Even with a revised and expanded edition, adding over 40 pages of text to describe why smart people believe weird things, he still fails to deliver on his promise.Shermer spends a majority of his time recounting his personal encounters with pseudo-scientists, attacking their methods, and reaffirming the good science they attempt to displace. He maintains a good narrative structure throughout which makes it an enjoyable read, but the work have several problems. His arguments tend to be facile and shallow. This is especially true when he actually takes the time to elaborate on the initial promise of the book. It makes for a strange situation where the argument becomes the weakest on the focal point on the topic. He jumps between two tones: his purported one where he disinterestedly examines pseudo-scientists to understand them, viewing them as mislead in their own right. And another where he openly criticizes them as charlatans, frauds, etc. You can't exactly have it both ways. I admire much of what Michael Shermer does, but he only weakly translates this into book form. "
43,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122606-chelsea,3,"Interesting, but not what I was hoping for. (Which is silly, because the title is pretty accurate. I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Weird Things People Believe and Why They're Wrong"". Shermer went into that a little, but not as much as I would have liked.)I really enjoyed Shermer's take on Creationists, and why they're not only wrong, they're also a little crazy. I'd love to read a more current opinion from him on, say, Dubya. My favorite part of the book was chapter 10, Confronting Creationists: Twenty-five Creationist Arguments, Twenty-Five Evolutionist Answers, which does exactly what the title says it does.His section on Holocaust denial seemed dated (which, ironically, I would not say about Deborah Lipstadt's Denying the Holocaust, which came out four years earlier, and discusses the topic in much greater detail.).I think I was hoping for more topics like alien abductions (which is covered, but briefly), ghosts (barely mentioned, and mostly in a ""but that's not even worth mentioning"" tone), or Bigfoot (who wasn't mentioned at all. sorry, big guy). I think Shermer and I disagree on ""weird"" - his choices strike me as more flat-out wrong than weird."
44,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28227278-heather-sinclair,2,"I must admit up front - I didn't read every page of this book. Another admission - I was fooled by the title. I was expecting this book to mostly be about the psychology that leads people to believe in things like superstitions, alien abductions, and ghosts. Maybe I should have read the synopsis more carefully, because this book was mostly about the people who believe these things and what they believe. There's a HUGE chapter on creationism, and rather than delve into much of the psychology, there's a long history of the creationist movement, and christian science in general. Ditto for the chapter on alien abductions. I did appreciate that the author came at these subjects from a perspective of trying to understand - rather than undermine or mock - such beliefs. When the science and psychology of belief was discussed, it was interesting. Especially about why *smart* people believe things that can't possibly be proven to be true. Like, ever. This book is recommended for people interested in the history of creationism, holocaust deniers, alien abductions, and afro-centrism. Do not read it if you'll hoping to learn mor about why people believe weird things, though. It's not really about that. "
45,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1782684-freud-s-nightmare,1,"Don't judge a book by its cover; or in this case, even its TITLE. This book devotes embarrassingly little content to answering its title question. Instead the author seems preoccupied with convincing the reader to agree with him on WHAT constitutes as a weird thing and WHY it qualifies as such. He tends to manipulate data and use complicated explanations to disguise his own bias and neglects to examine his own ideas with the same scrutiny by which he measures the opposing ones. Consequently, the reader is apt to believe his arguments without recognizing how frequently they end up being self-refuting. The structure and approach provided a sound framework from which to approach this topic but he sunk the project completely by allowing his personal convictions to eclipse the objective. It's disturbing to see how something so clearly biased is being passed off as objectively scientific in professional circles. Even worse, what a serious discredit to both psychology and science in general to be associated with this drivel in the mainstream media. "
46,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,3,"My Review: Mr. Shermer attempts to explain the unexplained, not concerning what we think, but how we think it. In his book, he uses a plethora of examples wherein odd, irrational, illogical, highly improbable events and beliefs were endorsed by many seemingly sane individuals. We all think, witness, believe interesting and, oftentimes, unbelievable things. How and why, then, do we believe it? The author suggests several theories; all of which are plausible. Toward the end of the book, however, he expressed true insight. ""Because it feels good!"" For those who want to go to a heaven, it feels good to believe that there is one! For those who receive pleasant information from our psychics, it feels good to believe that she is genuine!

It taught me a couple of things about myself and one of them is that at times I've believed in some weird stuff. I try to do that as little as possible the older I get, because I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two and hopefully gained some wisdom. I think I've always been somewhat of a skeptic and am more skeptical the older I become. I also become more determined not to be taken in by a bunch of ""flapdoodle."" I was amazed at the number of topics covered and I liked Shermer's writing style - although when he started drawing formulas, I started skimming. I don't have to know ALL the scientific facts. "

Theory Influences ObservationAbout the human quest to understand the physical world, physicist and Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg concluded, 'What we observe is not nature itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.' * * * That theory shapes perceptions of reality is true not only for quantum physics but also for all observations of the world. When Columbus arrive in the New World, he had a theory that he was in Asia and proceeded to perceive the New World as such. * * * A theory of Asia produced observations of Asia, even though Columbus was half a world away. Such is the power of theory.2. The Observer Changes the Observed* * * This is why psychologists use blind and double-blind controls. Lack of such controls is often found in tests of paranormal powers and is one of the classic ways that thinking goes wrong in the pseudosciences. Science tries to minimize and acknowledge the effects of the observation on the behavior of the observed; pseudoscience does not. 3. Equipment Constructs ResultsThe equipment used in an experiment often determines the results. * * * Problems in Pseudoscientific Thinking4. Anecdotes Do Not Make a ScienceAnecdotes -- stories recounted in support of a claim -- do not make science. Without corroborative evidence from other sources, or physical proof of some sort, ten anecdotes are no better than one, and a hundred anecdotes are no better than ten. Anecdotes are told by fallible human storytellers. * * * What we need are controlled experiments, not anecdotes. We need 100 subjects with cancer, all properly diagnosed and matched. * * * If there are statistically significant differences, we better get confirmation from other scientists who have conducted their own experiments separate from ours before we hold a press conference to announce the cure for cancer.5. Scientific Language Does Not Make a Science* * * 6. Bold Statements Do Not Make Claims TrueSomething is probably pseudoscientific if enormous claims are made for its power and veracity but supportive evidence is scarce as hen's teeth. L. Ron Hubbard, for example, opens his Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, with this statement: 'The creation of Dianetics is a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his invention of the wheel and arch.' Sexual energy guru Wilhelm Reich called his theory of Orgonomy 'a revolution in biology and psychology comparable to the Copernican Revolution.' I have a thick file of papers and letters from obscure authors filled iwth such outlandish claims (I cll it the 'Theories of Everything' file). Scientists sometimes make this mistake, too, as we saw at 1:00 p.m., on March 23, 1989, when Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischman held a press conference to announce to the world that they had made cold nuclear fusion work. Gary Taubes's excellent book about the cold fusion debacle, appropriately named Bad Science (1993), thoroughly examines the implications of this incident. Maybe fifty years of physics will be proved wrong by one experiment, but don't throw out your furnace until that experiment has been replicated. The moral is that the more extraordinary the claim, the more extraordinarily well-tested the evidence must be.7. Heresy Does Not Equal CorrectnessThey laughed at Copernicus. They laughed at the Wright Brothers. Yes, well, they laughed at the Marx brothers. Being laughed at does not mean you are right. * * * History is replete with tales of the lone scientist working in spite of his peers and flying in the face of the doctrines of his or her own field of study. Most of them turned out to be wrong and we do not remember their names. * * * The scientific community canot be expected to test every fantastic claim that comes along, especially when so many are logically inconsistent. If you want to do science, you have to learn to play the game of science. This involves getting to know the scientists in your field, exchanging data and ideas with colleagues informally, and formally presenting results in conference papers, peer-reviewed journals, books, and the like.8. Burden of ProofWho has to prove what to whom? The person making the extraordinary claim has the burden of proving to the experts and to the community at large that his or her belief has more validity than the one almost everyone else accepts. You have to lobby for your opinion to be heard. Then you have to marshal experts on your side so you can convince the majority to support your claim over the one that they have always supported. Finally, when you are in the majority, the burden of proof switches to the outsider who wants to challenge you with his or her unusual claim. Evolutionists had the burden of proof for half a century after Darwin, but now the burden of proof is on creationists. It is up to creationists to show why the theory of evolution is wrong and why creationism is right, and it is not up to evolutionists to defend evolution. The burden of proof is on the Holocaust deniers to prove the Holocaust did not happen, not on Holocaust historians to prove that it did. The rationale for this is that mountains of evidence prove that both evolution and the Holocaust are facts."" p. 46-51---[Responding to Ayn Rand's philosophy's ""belief that morals can be held to some absolute standard or criteria."" Are all human actions morally equal? ""Of course not, any more than all human music is equal. We create hierarchies of what we like or dislike, desire or reject, and make judgments based on those standards. But the standards are themselves human creations and cannot be discovered in nature. One group prefers classical music over rock, and so judges Mozart to be superior to the Moody Blues. Similarly, one group prefers patriarchal dominance, and so judges male privilege to be morally honorable. Neither Mozart nor males are absolutely better, but only so when judged by a particular group's standards. Male ownership of females, for example, was once thought to be moral and is now thought immoral. The change happened not because we have discovered this as immoral but because our society (thank primarily to the efforts of women) has realized that women should have rights and opportunities denied to them when they are in bondage to males. And having half of society happier raises the overall happiness of the group significantly.Morality is relative to the moral frame of reference. As long as it is understood that morality is a human construction influenced by human cultures, one can be more tolerant of other human belief systems, and thus other humans. But as soon as a group sets itself up as the final moral arbiter of other people's actions, especially when its members believe they have discovered absolute standards of right and wrong, it marks the beginning of the end of tolerance, and thus reason and rationality. It is this characteristic more than any other that makes a cult, a religion, a nation, or any other group dangerous to individual freedom. Its absolutism was the biggest flaw in Ayn Rand's Objectivism, the unlikeliest cult in history. The historical development and ultimate destruction of her group and philosophy is the empirical evidence that documents this assessment. What separates science from all other human activities (and morality has never been successfully placed on a scientific basis) is its commitment to the tentative nature of all its conclusions. THere are no final answers in science, only varying degrees of probability. Even scientific 'facts' are just conclusions confirmed to such an extent that it would be reasonable to offer temporary agreement, but that assent is never final. Science is not the affirmation of a set of beliefs but a process of inquiry aimed at building a testable body of knowledge constantly open to rejection or confirmation. In science, knowledge is fluid and certainty fleeting. That is at the heart of its limitations. It is also its greatest strength."" p. 123-24---""Late in his life, Charles Darwin received many letters asking for his views on God and religion. On October 13, 1880, for example, he answered a letter from the editor of a book on evolution and free thought who was hoping to dedicate it to him. Knowing that the book had an antireligious slant, Darwin dissembled: 'Moreover though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects, yet it appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follow from the advance of science. It has, therefore, been always my object to avoid writing on religion, & I have confined myself to science.' p. 137---In McLean v. Arkansas, US District Judge William R. Overton ""listed the 'essential characteristics' of science as outlined by the expert witnesses: '(1) It is guided by natural law; (2) It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law; (3) It is testable against the empirical world; (4) Its conclusions are tentative . . . ; and (5) It is falsifiable."" p. 161---From the US Supreme Court amici brief in a parallel Louisiana case, Edwards v. Aguillard, by primarily Jeffrey Lehman: ""'Science is devoted to formulating and testing naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena. It is a process for systematically collecting and recording data about the physical world, then categorizing and studying the collected data in an effort to infer the principles of nature that best explain the observed phenomena."" p. 167---""The Louisiana trial in general, and the amicus brief in particular, had the effect of temporarily galvanizing the scientific community into not only defending science as a way of understanding the world that is different from religion but defining science as a body of knowledge accumulated through a particular method--the scientific method. * * * Yet scientists have encountered 'outside forces' before and have not responded quite so collectively and emotionally. A second factor in explaining the unification in the Louisiana case may be the scientists' nearly unanimous perception that the creationists' position lacked any validity whatsoever. As Fitch noted, the Louisiana creationism attack was turned back with unprecedented collective force because 'it defies all scientific reason.' Gell-Man agrees: 'That's right. It's not so much that we were being attacked from the outside, since outsiders can make worthwhile contributions. It's that these people were talking utter nonsense' (1990)."" p. 171-72---""[H]umans are, by nature, a forward-looking species always seeking greater levels of happiness and satisfaction. Unfortunately, the corollary is that humans are all too often willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life or to believe that a better life can only be attained by clinging to intolerance and ignorance, by lessening the lives of others. And sometimes, by focusing on a life to come, we miss what we have in this life. It is a different source of hope, but it is hope nonetheless: hope that human intelligence, combined with compassion, can solve our myriad problems and enhance the quality of each life; hope that historical progress continues on its march toward greater freedoms and acceptance for all humans; and hope that reason and science as well as love and empathy can help us understand our universe, our world, and ourselves."" p. 278---Recognizing that revolutionary scientific ideas are sometimes accepted in a paradigm shift, ""[s]till, we can formulate a general outline of what might constitute a weird thing as we consider specific examples. For the most part, what I mean by a 'weird thing' is: (1) a claim unaccepted by most people in that particular field of study, (2) a claim that is either logically impossible or highly unlikely, and/or (3) a claim for which the evidence is largely anecdotal and uncorroborated. In my introductory example, most theologians recognize that God's existence cannot be proven in any scientific sense, and thus Dembski's and Tipler's goal of using science to prove God is not only unacceptable to most members of his knowledge community, it is uncorroborated because it is logically impossible. Cold fusion, to pick another example, is unaccepted by almost all physicists and chemists, is highly unlikely, and positive results have not been corroborated. Yet there is a handful of smart people (Arthur C. Clarke is the most notable) who hold out hope for cold fusion's future.'Smart people' suffers from a similar problem in operational definition, but at least here our task is aided by achievement criteria that most would agree, and the research snows, require a minimum level of intelligence. Graduate degrees (especially the Ph.D.), university positions (especially at recognized and reputable institutions), peer-reviewed publications, and the like, allow us to concur that, while we might quibble over how smart some of these people are, the problem of smart people believing weird things is a genuine one that is quantifiable through measurable data."" p. 282-83---""[W]hat we mean by 'weird things' here is not strictly limited to superstition and the paranormal. For example, cold fusion, creationism, and Holocaust revisionism could not reasonably be classified as superstitions or paranormal phenomena. In his review of the literature in one of the best books on this subject (Believing in Magic), psychologist Stuart Vyse (1997) concludes that while the relationship between intelligence and belief holds for some populations, it can be just the opposite in others. He notes that the New Age movement in particular 'has led to the increased popularity of these ideas among groups previously thought to be immune to superstition: those with higher intelligence, higher socioeconomic status, and higher educational levels. As a result, the time-honored view of believers as less intelligent than non-believers may only hold for certain ideas or particular social groups.'For the most part intelligence is orthogonal to and independent of belief. In geometry, orthogonal means 'at right angles to something else'; in psychology orthogonal means 'statistically independent. Of an experimental design: such that the variates under investigation can be treated as statistically independent,' for example, 'the concept that creativity and intelligence are relatively orthogonal (i.e., unrelated statistically) at high levels of intelligence' (OED). Intuitively, it seems like the more intelligent people are the more creative they will be. In fact, in almost any profession significantly affected by intelligence (e.g., science, medicine, the creative arts), once you are at a certain level among the population of practitioners (and that level appears to be an IQ score of about 125), there is no difference in intelligence between the most successful and the average in that profession. At that point other variables, independent of intelligence, take over, such as creativity, or achievement motivation and the drive to succeed."" p. 285. ---""4. Education and BeliefStudies on the relationship between education and belief are, like intelligence, gender, and age, mixed. Psychologist Chris Brand (1981), for example, discovered a powerful inverse correlation of -.50 between IQ and authoritarianism (as IQ increases authoritarianism decreases). Brand concluded that authoritarians are characterized not by an affection for authority, but by 'some simple-minded way in which the world has been divided up for them.' In this case, authoritarianism was being expressed through prejudice by dividing the world up by race, gender, and age. Brand attributes the correlation to 'crystallized intelligence,' a relatively flexible form of intelligence shaped by education and life experience. But Brand is quick to point out that only when this type of intelligence is modified by a liberal education does one a sharp decrease in authoritarianism. In other words, it is not so much that smart people are less prejudiced and authoritarian, but that educated people are less so.Psychologists S. H. and L. H. Blum (1974) found a negative correlation between education and superstition (as education increased superstitious beliefs decreased). Laura Otis and James Alcock (1982) showed that college professors are more skeptical than either college students or the general public (with the latter two groups showing no difference in belief), but that within college professors there was variation in the types of beliefs held, with English professors more likely to believe in ghosts, ESP, and fortune-telling. Another study (Pasachoff et al. 1971) found, not surprisingly, that natural and social scientists were more skeptical than their colleagues in the arts and humanities; most appropriately, in this context, psychologists were the most skeptical of all (perhaps because they best understand the psychology of belief and how easy it is to be fooled).Finally, Richard Walker, Steven Hoekstra, and Rodney Vogl (2001) discovered that there was no relationship between science education and belief in the paranormal among three groups of science students at three different colleges. That is, 'having a strong scientific knowledge base is not enough to insulate a person against irrational beliefs. Students that scored well on these tests were no more or less skeptical of pseudoscientific claims than students that scored very poorly. Apparently, the students were not able to apply their scientific knowledge to evaluate these pseudoscientific claims. We suggest that this inability stems in part from the way that science is traditionally presented to students: Students are taught what to think but not how to think.'Whether teaching students how to think will attenuate belief in the paranormal remains to be seen. Supposedly this is what the critical thinking movement has been emphasizing for three decades now, yet polls show that paranormal beliefs continue to rise."" p. 290-91---On Confirmation Bias: ""In 1620 English philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon offered his own Easy Answer to the Hard Question: 'The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion * * * draws all things else to support and agree with it.' * * * Why do smart people believe weird things? Because, to restate my thesis in light Bacon's insight, smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons."" p. 296-97---""Of course, science contains a special self-correcting mechanism to get around the confirmation bias: other people will check your results or rerun the experiment. If your results were entirely the product of confirmation bias, someone will sooner or later catch you on it. That is what sets science apart from all other ways of knowing.Finally, and most importantly for our purposes here, the confirmation bias operates to confirm and justify weird beliefs. Psychics, fortune tellers, palm readers, and astrologers, for example, all depend on the power of the confirmation bias by telling their clients (some would call them 'marks') what to expect in their future. By offering them one-sided events (instead of two-sided events in which more than one outcome is possible), the occurence of the event is noticed while the nonoccurrence of the event is not."" p. 301"
55,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198371-jason,3,"Overall, this was a pretty enjoyable book, but nothing that really wows a person. I had hoped for more of the psychology and sociology behind exactly why we humans believe weird things. However, for the most part the book is just a collection of anecdotes and examples with a brief dabbling into the psychology of weird beliefs. It begins with a look at science vs pseudoscience and covers 25 common logical fallacies that contribute to erred thinking. Next the areas of phenomena like psychic powers, alien abductions, and creationism are pretty soundly put in their place for the limited pages given to them, on why the reasoning for such beliefs are erroneous. But Shermer takes a bit of a turn and somewhat awkwardly dedicates 68 pages of this book – a full one quarter of the book – to Holocaust denial. Or really, a somewhat conflated mashup of Holocaust denial, questioning, and revisionism, which all share similarities but are distinct positions. The odd part about it, was that he presents the Holocaust revisionist position as far more reasonable than one might expect while contrasting that with the more extreme, racist denier positions. However, he then somewhat flips that and lumps them altogether, setting out to debunk the extreme fringe denialism (leaving the earlier, milder revisionism position mostly untouched), but does a rather disappointing job at the debunking. Often, where he correctly points out the post hoc rationalizations used by the deniers, he’ll then use as evidence against them, the same sort of post hoc rationalizations to explain the evidence. This does nothing but make the deniers case look stronger, and the targeting of the soft targets while ignoring so much of the firmer, creates a feeling that Shermer cannot adequately answer many of the revisionist or denier claims, even if this isn’t necessarily so. This may be simply due to consideration for space, as the topic is a bit too involved to be handled as just a section of a larger book on weird beliefs, and he might have done better dedicating an entire book to the subject. Needless to say, Shermer’s debunking, while at times decent, largely came off as much too weak and honestly leaves one—while clear on the denier nonsense—more intrigued however by the more reasonable sounding revisionist claims that were left untouched. Maybe that’s the wise way to go however? To take Shermer’s presentation as a primer, then read the best two Holocaust books and the best two Holocaust revisionist books and see what the outcome is? Either way, it was an unfortunate allocation of page space that would have been served better as a fascinating book of its own. For the remainder of the book, Shermer seems to have some trouble regaining focus on what the book is supposed to be about – why people believe weird things. After the lengthy foray into the aside topic of the Holocaust, Shermer meanders a bit before hitting a few brief points on exactly why people believe weird things. Then he pretty much wraps it up in a quick summary, and for the most part we’re still left wondering why people believe weird things. The book gives us some general logical fallacies and touches on some problematic hardwiring of our minds, but never really gets into the meat and potatoes of exactly why people believe weird things. While a full quarter of the book is spent on the Holocaust, the remaining 75% of the book is almost entirely used for examples and anecdotes *about* some weird beliefs, but gives very little actual causal or explanatory reasons for why such beliefs are held. All in all, the book was a pleasant read, but in my opinion really fell short of accomplishing what the title implied the reader would learn. "
56,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,3,"Okay – I have a confession to make. I have no idea what I’m doing in life. Not just in my career choices, but in pretty much anything. I’m hungry… what should I eat? I don’t know. Whatever it is will probably either be so expensive that I can’t afford it, or it will slowly poison me until I die, alone, fat and malnourished, and also broke. I need to tighten that faucet. What? I was supposed to know about plumbers tape? Never heard of it, but it was a thing I was supposed to know about, and now I have a house full of water. Which will ruin the floor, and rot through the cabinets. Apparently, dogs shouldn’t eat garlic or grapes. They might just drop dead on the spot. Also, my mother goes to the Chiropractor for a free visit, and before I know it I’m standing in this guy’s office a week later, while he’s try to explain that she has early stage dementia and all sorts of medical problems (that no M.D. could ever find or diagnose) and that if she’d sign up for his $4000 special he’d fix her. And then it hits me. This guy is just as much of a dumbass as I am. And at that point I had to stand up and say, ‘Hey, I realize I don’t know anything about anything, but I’m starting to think that you don’t either.’But that guy, I swear, I don’t think he’s trying to swindle a 70 year-old woman on a fixed income. He actually believes what he’s saying (there is a much longer story about this chiropractor – as I have some background knowledge of this man from before he crossed paths with my mother, but I’m not going to get into that. I just want to make you understand that I really believe that he really believes what he’s saying). And that isn’t to rant against chiropractors. They have their place. I don’t think that place is diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. I’ll save my rants about that sort of stuff for a later date. But it does dovetail into what this book is about. So, this book, it’s kind of old now, it’s about why people believe weird things. I have my own thoughts about this, which he touches on a few times, but mostly, he just goes over a few examples of crazy ideas people have and then goes into some detail about why those ideas are crazy. Like I implied above, the book could be summed up in a few sentences. The bulk of the text is just supporting arguments, or digressions the author felt like making. So he goes over things like Holocaust denial and psychic remote viewing and explains the minutia of who the big players are in the movement, what they say, and why they are wrong.The gist of the book is simply that people tend to make decisions about their beliefs based on emotions, then use their rationalization skills in order to defend said beliefs. There, I did it all in a single sentence. Intelligence has little to do with believing something weird (he even has a chapter on why smart people believe weird things), nor does race, or gender. It’s just a people thing. If you are a person, you probably hold nonsensical beliefs about things, and if you’re smart, you’re probably better than most people at defending your dumb ideas, and more confident that you’re correct about your dumb beliefs – because you used your big brain to make all these great defenses against your detractors. But, like that Baha’I tract I reviewed several months ago, this also has an agenda. He’s really selling me of skepticism, a way of examining the world around me and determining the assumptions I can about it that are most likely to be true. And about weighing the probabilities that things other people ask me to believe are actually true. Which is fine, he’s not hiding that from the reader, he’s pretty upfront about it. But once I start thinking of it along those lines, I feel like it falls a bit short of some of my favorite books on the topic, most notably, Carl Sagan’s, The Demon Haunted World. Of course, I read The Demon Haunted world almost 20 years ago, and it blew my mind. I’ve read probably close to a dozen books that I’d nominally put in the same sort of category since, and have attended lectures on the topic, as well as listening to hundreds of hours of talk about critical thinking and skepticism. So a lot of the stories and anecdotes he shares in these pages feel like old hat to me. I’ve heard them all, and I’ve heard them all in a lot of other places. I actually read the first edition of this book back when it first came out, and I remember at the time thinking it was really good. But I’d never bother to pick up the revised and updated edition that came out a few years later (which this is). It’s still been a long time since even that came out (2002 maybe). I’ve long since forgotten the content of the book, so I’m reading this like it’s the first time all over again. Except – it does feel like I’ve read this before, and I have, except I forgot about. Despite always knowing I’d read it before. Whatever. Don’t judge me. I know what I’m saying and it makes perfect sense. To me, that is. So, this is something that is part of a much longer conversation – one that plays out from book to book, as an author will make a point, and a whole book will come out later to rebut that, then another to rebut the rebuttal, and so on. So I’ve been following this back and forth since I first starting reading Sagan’s books, and now, to go back and read this, I don’t know, if just feels a bit out of time to me. Like it’s ground already well covered (which it might not have been back when this came out, I don’t know) I may go back and reread The Demon Haunted World soon, just to see if it still moves me the way it did all those year ago (I’ve actually read it three times, but all three were probably within a single year – it really floored me at the time).Still, I think the best parts of this are when the author, Michael Shermer, talks about his own journey, from a born-again Christian to new age practitioner to what he is today. He talks about that and it feels timeless. But then he transitions to specifics of alien abductions or the intelligence of races and the book feels very much of its time. I wish he didn’t try to cover such material in a single book. It went too quickly and very little time was spent on the underlying question of WHY.So, I don’t think this is a must read, if you believe one of the crazy things he covers in this book, I doubt you’ll come away with a changed mind (in fact, I’d wager I know 50 people that would agree with every part of this book, then get to the section on young earth creationism and say, ‘Waitaminute, he was making so much sense a minute ago, then he went bonkers’).I feel like this glosses over things too quick (although, he does point out that entrenched beliefs are not overcome with facts – so this could have been 1500 pages longer and it wouldn’t matter). And he spents too much time, I think, on the background of the holocaust denial movement. In all, I think three full chapters are spent on the larger topic of holocaust denial. In my personal life, I just don’t know if I ever come across people that take those claims seriously – but talk about the moon landings or child vaccinations and folks get really opinionated really quickly – but that stuff is barely touched on here. In all, read if you just have to, but otherwise, I think even some of Shermer’s other works are better at answering the question he asks in the title itself. This is just an overview of skepticism in general and a quick example that something as simple as understanding the burden of proof could make things so much easier for so many people. "
57,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85608235-paige-hammersley,4,"Why People Believe Weird Things by Michael Shermer starts interesting and funny, then gradually declines into the average boredom of a Wikipedia article. In an attempt to combat this, Shermer includes many personal anecdotes to add flavor to the text. These stories can be quite entertaining, but the attention is soon pulled back into the repetitive information. The explanatory portion grows increasingly monotonous as the book goes on, as he explains the same dull data many times either in the same chapter or the next. This problem is not just about a few of the ideas, either; the issue lies in the whole concept of the book. Eventually, you reach a point where you think, “Great, people believe weird things. Can we get to the ‘why’?” Unfortunately, you never really do get to the ‘why’.Another Goodreads review mentioned that the constant repetition and personal musings in each chapter make topics carry on much longer than they should. Shermer could have explained most items in the book in one chapter or less, but instead are dragged out without reason. The book quickly loses its spark because of this. From the cover and its beginning, it appears quite promising. Readers are put under a haze that tells them the entire book will be both funny and informative. One can learn more about how people think as well as how to avoid believing weird things, while also finding laugh-out-loud tales throughout. This idea is quickly washed away as the book carries on. Each chapter feels like a high school essay on a straightforward concept that had a minimum word limit: They are filled with unnecessary information and reinforcements that make them much longer than one would assume them to be. The same review stated at the end that the person would recommend Why People Believe Weird Things to others because it is “for lack of a better description interesting”. Before seeing that, I would not have recommended it to anybody, but this reader has a point. Though the book has many flaws and could have been executed in a much more concise manner, it is still interesting enough to give some time to. While I still do not believe reading this book is worthwhile, listening to it may be a good idea. Having another task to do while hearing it takes the boredom out of its unending, repetitive information and allows its humor and insight to shine through. So, to anyone considering reading this book: Don’t. Invest in Audible."
58,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"I read 3 Shermer books tonight and which one said what get's a bit jumbled because they retread themselves so much so let me give my response to the thinker himself, because what's in these three books doesn't bother me so much as what isn't: Shermer is an intellectual coward.It's damn easy to say ""We're way more advanced than Neanderthals, and the Nazis were evil. I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
59,0805070893,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13411533-kaine-andrews,3,"I grabbed this book, expecting it to explore and debunk (or confirm) some of the weird things that people let cross their minds in the dark hours of the evening; even the chapter headings seemed to imply that would be the result.What I found instead is a fascinating, psychology-lite explanation of just how people come to some of these conclusions. It may not have been the book I thought I was getting, but it was certainly interesting.Providing a bit of insight into the why of how we think rather than just the what of it, the book provides rational explanations for such things as ghosts and flat earth logic, including discussions of what about such things provides comfort and logic to minds that desperately need it.On closing the book, the only thing I felt could have been done better was the presentation of the weird beliefs themselves; while the book does a decent job of explaining why people cling to these beliefs, even in the face of evidence or when presented with potential alternative explanations, it frequently begins each chapter by presenting the ""weird thing"" as being utterly ludicrous and overblown, lacking any sense of nuance and leading the reader to genuinely believe in the insanity of anyone who actually believes it.To be fair, I do tend to think a lot of those folks are crazy, but coming out of the gate swinging when you haven't even presented the theory seems a little extreme, in my book.Overall, worth poking at if you have an interest in psychology or the rationales that lead someone to potentially illogical beliefs, but less so if you're actually looking for weird things."
