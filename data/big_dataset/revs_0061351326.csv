0,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"This is an illustrated biography of Marie and Pierre Curie and an impressionistic exploration of the marks their pioneering research left on the world. As history, I thought it was great. Extensive reliance on primary sources, juxtaposition of the past (Marie's letters, a Russian map of Chernobyl) and the present (a phone interview with a nuclear security expert, collages by a survivor of Hiroshima), and a thorough list of annotated citations all made for a compelling, believable experience. As a work of art, the singularity of the work is impressive. Redniss not only created all the visuals and wrote the text, but she also designed the font and, I assume, did all her own typography. It's not comics (no attempts to depict time with sequential images), but this form of illustrated non-fiction is certainly unique and interesting.That said, I'm not sure what the format contributes to the history, or to Redniss's interpretation. The illustrations are beautiful, ghostly, sad, largely stemming from the luminescent qualities of the cyanotypes and a palette of cool blues, greens, and oranges (radium, as Redniss points out in a colophon, glows faintly blue), all of which contribute to the mystery and melancholy underlying the work and lives of the Curies, but I find the line drawings inappropriately dehumanized. Faces are mostly expressionless, with deeply lined eyes, but otherwise rendered with minimal (even child-like) line work, often resembling some of Picasso sketches. The effect is eerie, and I don't think it illuminates the interaction between the deep passions and equally powerful intellects of the Curies in the way the text does.Honestly, my favorite portion of the book was the quote from Loie Fuller in the beginning (herself a fascinating person at the edge of art and science), which captures the strange liminal sensation of the time (and of this book), when science's push against the boundaries of mystery was something you could see and touch.To see, to feel, to smell, to hear, to taste, these are the only invisible facts—but which we acknowledge are real—the sensations of horror that kills, of grief that prostrates, joy that uplifts, and faith that cures—what if these things can be registered and seen apart from the body, are they not then material things? And may they not indicate that other invisible materials exist—which are in reality material if we had the human capacity for observing them?... Perhaps Radium and its sister elements may one day help us here. We may not believe, but we do not know that we should not believe!Also, check out this glowing (apologies) review in the Times."
1,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate,4,"Way Outside the BoxSo I order this to read for our book club, thinking it would be just a normal account of the Curies' discovery of radioactivity. The book arrives. Surely there must be some mistake; this looks like something for children—pages filled with big colored illustrations mingled with occasional paragraphs of handwritten text. But no, while often childlike, the book is never childish. And the mixture of media gives only a hint of how widely author-artist Lauren Redniss has foraged to fill her cornucopia of art, science, and history.She starts by apologizing to Marie Curie for ignoring her insistence that ""there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life."" Not only does she make such a connection, she glories in it. Look at the chapter headings of the first part: Symmetry, Magnetism, Fusion—scientific terms, but also personal ones. In the opening chapter, Redniss portrays the separate lives of Pierre and Marie in symmetry, on opposite pages, before showing the magnetism that drew them together as a couple, and the fusion that produced a child. But she also tells us of Pierre's work on the symmetry of crystals, and Marie's on magnetism and radiation. The question of atomic fusion (and fission) lies far in the future.But Redniss goes there too. At the very end of the first part, amid drawings of Marie and Pierre embracing in their laboratory, she has the words: ""The new science needed a name."" Turn the page to a double spread glowing in a muted cloudburst, containing only the words, ""I coined the term radioactivity."" Then look again, and you realize that the cloudburst is really an atomic blast—not at all in your face, but lurking there as a threat.Although the longer second part continues with the story of the Curies, it strikes off sparks in many other directions: spiritualism, for example, the dancer Loïe Fuller, a list of famous Poles. A photograph of a man receiving radium treatment for a tumor in 1920 is juxtaposed with the first-hand account of a tumor survivor in 2001. Soon, we are jumping to Chernobyl, the Manhattan Project, and Three-Mile Island, and each time Redniss finds some unexpected witness to bring her message home. An FBI surveillance report; photos of the mutant zinnias and roses found near Harrisburg; the reports of a biologist studying wildlife in the Ukraine. One of the most effective spreads in the book is also the simplest, a black paper cutout used by a survivor of Hiroshima to show how her father's blackened skin peeled away at a touch.""A tale of love and fallout,"" says the subtitle. Nothing is predictable, neither the great discoveries nor their unexpected consequences, and love is the least logical thing of all. So by jumping around in subject and time, Redniss is only celebrating the power of surprise. She is thinking outside the box, way outside. The skill with which she balances the glory of the Curies' discoveries and their continued benefits against their terrible consequences would be remarkable even in a book that was all text. But the illustrations offer a further layer of unpredictability. In almost no case does she simply illustrate the action; her drawings are bold, somewhat expressionist, even disturbing. I can't say that I like them as art, but as a constantly shifting matrix for a subject that refuses to be pinned down, their effect is powerful indeed.My only real complaint is that patches on the hard cover are printed in slightly raised ink like fine sandpaper, that you fear coming off on your hands. But close the cover and put out the lights, and you will see their purpose: the book literally glows in the dark!"
2,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,3,"This book is an illustrated biography of Pierre and Marie Curie, and be forewarned that the cover art glows in the dark. It took me several moments to realize that I was not experiencing a paranormal event one dark night.I have mixed feelings about this book. Marie Currie is someone I have been fascinated with since I was a kid, and it was fun to read about her again, and learn quite a few new interesting nuggets in the process. The art in this book is wonderfully evocative - ghostly and luminous, but towards the latter half of the book, there was almost too much text, and muddling of the main story line. Still, I liked it, and will certainly be reading other books by this author."
3,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,5,"It seems absurd to try to talk about this book without you being able to see it. It is easy enough to describe the story Lauren Redniss tells in this graphic biography, but hard to describe the emotional colour her images bring to her words. The details of Marie Sklodowksa and Pierre Curie's joint biographies are reasonably familiar to readers of science history - his early scientific talent and her struggle to get a scientific education; their romance and marriage; their separate and joint research, and distillation of first radium and then polonium; his early death, and the famous story of Marie taking over his chair at the Sorbonne, walking in and picking up his lecture where he had left it; Marie's ongoing work and passionate (and scandalous) affair with Paul Langevin; her work in World War One with mobile x-ray units, where she was joined by her teenage daughter Irene, who herself went on to become a nuclear physicist, also working with her husband, Frederick Joliot and, like her parents before her, sharing a Nobel Prize with him; Marie's death from aplastic pernicious anaemia, the result of prolonged exposure to radiation, in 1934 aged 66.What Redniss brings to the pile of literature that already surrounds the couple is a sense of the passion of their relationship - and especially of Marie as a physical and sensual woman - that is coupled to the intensity of their scientific research. I have always been somewhat puzzled, looking at the photos of Marie Curie once out of her teenage years, that this rather shadowy, rather dowdy woman could have been at the centre of one of France's most titillating love stories - that she could actually have duels fought over her. But Redniss makes tremendous use of archival material. From Marie's diary just before Pierre's death, written as the family was on holidayWe collected flowering chestnut branches and gathered a huge bouquet of large water buttercups that you loved so ... We slept nuzzled against each other, as always ... I sat down against you and lay across your body ... I had a little clenching in my heart holding you there, but I felt happy... And then after his death, run down by a horse-drawn cart on a rainy Paris streetThey brought you in and placed you on the bed ... I kissed you and you were still supple and almost warm.... Pierre, my Pierre, you are there, calm as a poor wounded man resting in his sleep, his head bandaged. Your face is sweet, as if you dream.... My Pierre, I got up after after slept rather well, relatively calm. That was barely a quarter of an hour ago, and now I want to howl again - like a savage beast.""Four years after death, Marie fell heavily for his former student, the (married) scientist Paul Langevin. The two exchanged torrid letters when separated, even if only for a matter of hours. From Langevin:I am trembling with impatience at the thought of seeing you return at last, and of telling you how much I missed you. I kiss you tenderly awaiting tomorrow.Redniss conveys more information in a small number of words than you would expect possible. She doesn't stint on the science or the story, and her style is personal, but never quirky or too I-thinky. You get the sense of someone who has conducted a great deal of researcj, and then pared back and pared back and pared back, without losing any colour.And colour is at the heart of this book. Where Judith Schalansky's 'Atlas of Remote Islands', similarly a mix of words and images, was restrained in its palette, Redniss' book is joyous and unbounded. The end papers are ochre Rothko-esque colour fields, that feel soaked in pigment; each chapter is signalled by a midnight blue double-page spread with spidery white words picked out across it; the water buttercups are a radiant spray of yellow and red, blue and green. While Redniss' drawing style is not one I would spend time with on a wall - somewhere between Clemente, de Chirico and the happiest bits of Expressionism - paired with her story, it works.In particular, Redniss has adapted the photographic printing technique of cyanotype, where chemically treated paper is exposed to sunlight, with the positive spaces masked - the sunlight causes a reaction that turns the exposed paper Prussian blue - the colour of old-fashioned blueprints. The areas that were masked seem, when revealed, to let light shine through from a hidden source. As Redniss writes in an endnoteUsing this process to create the images in this book made sense to me for a number of reasons. First, the negative of an image gives an impression of an internal light, a sense of glowing that I felt captured what Marie Curie called radium's ""spontaneous luminosity"". ... Second, because photographic imaging was central to the discovery both of X-rays and of radioactivity ... Last, I later learned, Prussian blue capsules were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a ""safe and effective"" treatment for internal contamination by radioactive cesium and radioactive thallium.Interpolated with the story of Marie and Pierre's life is the 20th century's radioactive history: Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, radiation therapy, ""fossy jaw"", Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Redniss finds one small detail to illustrate each of these big stories: a woman in Pennsylvania who collects, photographs and presses flowers mutated by the fallout from Three Mile Island; a scientist who researches birds in the area surrounding Chernobyl; a Japanese woman who was 13 on the day the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, who makes for Redniss a paper cutout that shows how her father's blackened skin peeled off his body, exposing the red muscle underneath. Never sentimental, these interludes - especially this last - have incredible emotional heft. And finally - the cover glows in the dark. What more delight can you ask for?"
4,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1031706-hannah-garden,4,"I thought this book was just so lovely. The illustrations are amoeba-y--grave and slender--elegant creepy jellicle elegies for the Curies. I like the text, too--the font is sick and the syntax is precise and gentle, like little wooden pieces that fit together with barely audible clicks.  "
5,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126060-alicen,4,I loved this book for the sheer fact that when I put it down the other night and turned off the lights it GLOWED. A beautiful book in its genre-bending (is it a biography? A graph novel?) that I highly recommend (although I will note for those who know a lot about Marie Curie's life already it might be a tad boring). 
6,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5956712-barbara-mcewen,4,"4.5 stars- All right graphic novel fans, art lovers, and science nerds, this is for you. This one is a work of art. You get to learn tidbits of science, some juicy gossip, and it is packaged beautifully. It is not, by any stretch, exhaustive for those of you wanting a full biography. My only qualm, if I want to be picky, is you do jump around in time between Pierre and Marie Curie's lifetime and the creation of the atomic bomb and other subsequent uses of their findings. I think it is an artistic choice and it is very attractive but a bit jumpy. There isn't any separation or indication you are moving onto another topic. Still, I would buy this as a coffee table book if anyone who visited me read."
7,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2274107-summer,2,I thought this was okay. The art wasn't particularly impressive to me and the narrative was disjointed. It would talk about periods of Marie Curie's life chronologically but then it would suddenly jump ahead in time and switch topics periodically. It did contain some interesting information but I would recommend watching a documentary or read a biography about Marie Curie over this. 
8,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"""My head is so full of plans that it seems aflame...""From RADIOACTIVE: Marie and Pierre Curie, A Tale of Love and Fallout, by Lauren Redniss, 2011.#ScienceSeptemberA unique and original work that combines stunning artwork, original documentation and archival material, the biography of Marie and Pierre Curie, and the antecedents and ramifications of their discoveries of polonium and radium...Interspersed within the history and love story of the Curies, Redniss cuts to a later events - Manhattan Project, Hiroshima, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island- to show the Pandora's box of the discoveries in their Paris laboratories. The earth shattering disasters, but also the advancements in medicine with radiation therapy on cancer patients. Pierre took a vial of radium to dinner parties... Marie slept with it under her pillow. Pierre died in a carriage accident, perhaps spared the inevitable painful death that Marie endured from long term radiation exposure... Their laboratory materials and notebooks still clicking the Geiger counters as radioactive 100+ years later.Along with Redniss's haunting and imaginative artwork, cast in a glowing blue cyanotype, she shows photographs, letters, and maps, all alongside a detailed text. Excerpts from Marie's doctoral dissertation and mentions of her TWO Nobel Prizes: Physics, 1903 - shared with Pierre, and Chemistry 1911, solo.💫 A beautiful and innovative work that immortalizes the work and life of these scientific pioneers. Highly recommended for biography, science, and art lovers."
9,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,3,"This was my first graphic novel (well, not really a novel -- graphic work of non-fiction? too long), and I think the medium may just not be for me. If I had to describe this book in one word, that word would be ""distracting.""I was distracted by everything, particularly the pictures and the artistic but annoying-to-read font. The narrative itself was distracting, jumping around in time and space even though it all connected back to radioactivity. A more tolerant reader might have appreciated the collage-like effect, which clearly involved a lot of effort and creativity. I acknowledge all that, but it just wasn't for me.Sometimes it felt like Redniss just didn't have that much to say, and was using art and gimmicks (like putting only a few words on a page) to stretch the story to book length. It really felt more like I was reading an article than a book. Sometimes I felt like the story was dumbed down, although that may have simply been a visceral reaction to having pictures in my books which I thought I outgrew a long time ago. Other times I felt like it was over my head with all the chemistry stuff. Science is not usually my preferred reading area, and although I ended up enjoying books like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks and The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, I think that attests to the quality of those books rather than to my aptitude for or interest in science reading. Unfortunately, Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie is not one of the books that managed to bridge the gap between me and science.So three stars because I recognize the creativity here and a lot of interesting bits about the Curies and radioactivity, but only three because it just didn't work that well for me."
10,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,5,"As a total art design project, the book is stellar. Using cyanotype prints is brilliant, the bluish glow irresistible; mesmerizing the enthralled reader like a 50s illusionist until one wonders if a CT Scan needs scheduling. Redniss designed the type (Eusapia LR, named for Eusapia Palladino, a spiritualist, whose seances the Curies attended), and it fits the radioactive subject matter. Reverse white type on a dark background is hard to read; and the orange pages are close to impossible, but perhaps having to peer closely at the text imprints the words better. Interviews with people who have worked with, dug around and been toasted by radiation add mutant flavor to the tale of love and fallout. The Curies' + descendants is a bizarre tale, and Redniss shares it as art that accentuates the horror of the killer elements, the blinding light of the physics, the sublime restfulness of amour, and the ridiculousness of humanity on its quest for the ultimate healer/destroyer. Redniss has created something entirely new - like the Joliet-Curies and their artificial radioactivity."
11,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,5,"A graphic novel on the life of Marie and Pierre Curie. This book is done in mixed media format containing drawings, paintings, photographs, and cyanotype print. This is probably the most interestingly done graphic novel I have ever read. The story of the two scientists is also fascinating. I highly recommend this book."
12,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265660-mainon,5,"WOW.This book is a new addition to my list of all-time favorites. Here is a short, incomplete list of the things I loved about it:1. The subject. It's about Marie Curie, who is one of the most accomplished scientists of all time -- educational and inspiring! It's also about her actual discoveries, and how they changed the way we thought about the very nature of things. Double educational and inspiring! PS: did you know she was the first person, man or woman, to receive two Nobel prizes?2. The breadth. The book isn't careful about tracking the life of Mme. Curie, or talking only about things she accomplished. It has an easy-going, free-association kind of style, like a conversation with a brilliant and well-read friend, that can range from a list of other Polish superstars to Mme. Curie's sex scandal to the scientists behind the Manhattan Project to the story of a couple who think visits to radioactive caves have helped treat the wife's Hepatitis C. And yet it all feels planned rather than disjointed!3. The art. I'm a huge fan of books-as-art, where the experience of reading is enhanced by font, paper color and thickness, illustration, text size and color, and creative layouts. This book has all of that, and yet I never once thought a page seemed too busy or that anything lacked a purpose. Instead, every time I turned the page, I looked forward to seeing what my eyes would get to encounter next! PS: some of the images on the cover are glow-in-the-dark! And some of the internal illustrations were created using cyanotype, a photographic printing process that produces a cyan-blue print. Not only is it fitting that these illustrations were created using a chemical process, but the result is reminiscent of the soft glow of radium that so entranced Mme. Curie.4. The size. This is shaped like a coffee table book, tall and wide but slim. This makes it perfect for displaying and a pleasure to read (although there are one or two pages where the layout requires the font to be just a bit too small for my taste -- but then, having to peer closely at a few of the pages is also part of the reading experience!) This would also make a fabulous gift -- maybe for a new high school graduate? In short, I can't think of another time when I've seen such a wonderful amalgamation of art and science in a single package. Also, I learned a lot, and  enjoyed myself thoroughly (two things that I often experience singly, but nothing beats experiencing them at the same time!)Six exclamation points in this review: this may be a new record."
13,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,3,"Redniss this year got a MacArthur ""genius"" grant for her work, and so I decided to check out her graphic history of Marie and Pierre Curie, which she illustrated and hand lettered, and in which she used a printing technique that allows some of the pages to glow in the dark, appropriately enough.By and large, I thought this was terrific, except for one small quibble. She interrupted the chronological story of the Curies with somewhat random leaps forward into the present day to explain everything from Three Mile Island to Chernobyl to a cave where people go to get radon exposure, and I thought the technique was a little off-putting at times.The biographical information was great, though, and I had no idea what a melodramatic life the Curies had led. I knew about how sick they became through exposure to radiation, but I didn't know that Pierre was crushed to death beneath a horse and wagon, or that Marie became involved with a married French scientist five years later, and the ensuing scandal caused some members of the Nobel Prize committee to urge her not to attend the ceremony for her second Nobel. It was also fascinating to see how her children carried on her work, and to know that she set up many mobile X-ray labs during WWI to help guide surgeons in doing wartime operations.I marvel at the design work that accompanied the other intensive research for this book."
14,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6087693-carl,4,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked this book up from the library. I just knew it was recommended highly by others, and as a scientist I was interested in the topic of the Curie's and radioactivity.My first clue that I was in for something quite different was the size of the book–it was 8.5 x 11. When I opened it I was even more surprised. There were no white pages with black print text, except for an occasional one which was very different from the traditional ones. Instead there were pages with line drawings and cyanotype prints and some text. The cyanotype prints are interesting because they replicate the glow of radium, which Marie and Peter Curie discovered. The text, or print, itself is interesting because it was created by the author for this volume.The story is interestingly told–how Marie and Pierre Curie loved and studied and discovered radioactivity. But in between the telling of this story are interesting stories and pages about radioactivity subsequent to the Curies and their discoveries: the Manhattan Project, the Nevada underground testing, the Chernobyl disaster, and others.This is truly a unique and interesting book, and I'm glad I read it, or whatever I did with it."
15,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1421407-janet,5,"Gorgeous, improbably wonderful graphic novel about the love affair and scientific work of Pierre and Marie Curie. I saw it first in an exhibition in the New York Public Library, and fell in love with it. The volatility of the elements they were working with… the danger and the excitement… the illustrations are amazing. I still remember those shocking first minutes of seeing what Redniss had undertaken, breathtaking and enchanting."
16,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1815319-robyn,4,"THE COVER GLOWS IN THE DARK! Dedication:

 With apologies to Marie Curie, who said, “There is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life.”

 Part biography part historical account, Radioactive looks at Marie Curie’s scientific accomplishments, her personal life, and her everlasting effect on our world. Lauren Redniss’ thoughtful technique provides the reader with a unique visual experience. What Dazzled: I can say I haven’t encountered anything quite like this, or if I have it didn’t leave much of an impression. I was astonished at the amount of information packed into 208 pages where many of the pages were only artwork. The author focuses primarily on Marie Curie beginning with her early years secretly attending college, working as a governess, and falling in love (not with Pierre Curie). Our attention is also drawn to different time periods and the events taking place such as the Manhattan Project and an interview of a personal account of chemotherapy in 2001. Together this was just an amazing package.What Fizzled: I won’t lie, I didn’t love the artwork. Several times I thought, this looks like children’s scribbles. It’s definitely not a style I want hanging on my walls, but I did come to appreciate it. More so when I read the author’s note about cyanotype print and Eusapia LR typeface. Jots and Thoughts: Radioactive really made me think about what is a graphic novel, and whether or not this is one. First, there’s no easy definition of what exactly constitutes a graphic novel. Some guidelines have been used in regard to form, content, and publication. I’m sure as I continue to read more and learn more about graphic novels my opinion will change, but for now I feel Radioactive is right on the line of being considered a graphic novel. In particular there’s three pages dedicated to the topic of Pierre Curie’s death beginning on page 96. The scene starts with text but the next 5 pages rely solely on Redniss’ artwork to convey the events. The horse-drawn carriage pulling a massive cargo load / the driver and horse trying to stop but the load’s momentum pushing them onward / two figures carry a limp body away. Visual storytelling, right? But for the most part the text is what pushes the narrative along while the artwork and photographs provide atmosphere. But that’s not entirely accurate, because there are other great examples of when the text hands the narrative baton to the artwork. This is going to take some time to process. This is being turned into a movie!"
17,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5213747-kurt,5,"Here's the short form. Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie, A Tale of Love and Fallout is a biography of Marie Curie. That is roughly accurate and thoroughly uninteresting. In addition to being beautiful and beautifully told, this book is the story of Marie Curie, of her discoveries of radium and polonium, and of the legacies of them all.Redniss begins her first chapter, Symmetry, cleverly and counter-intutively. On the left hand page is information about Pierre Curie, whom, we can pretty safely deduce, will be the husband of Marie. On the right hand page is the first news of Marie Skłodowska. So far so good. Turn the page and a non sequitur, more information about Pierre but written in a way that doesn't connect to the previous page.Ah.The left hand pages of Symmetry are all Pierre. The right hand pages are all Marie.Redniss is not always so aggressive about her structure, but it's smart to make her move in the opening pages because it teaches us that we have to be ready for the next trick, whatever it might be. Throughout her writing, the author locates the parallels between the Curies' love, lives, and research, and intertwines them from one chapter to the next. It is a tight and smart dramaturgical trick, nor does she get carried away with it. She discusses Marie Curie's first Nobel prize - in physics, with her husband and fellow researcher Henri Becquerel - and how Alfred Nobel made his fortune from which he could dispense philanthropic cheer via his development of dynamite. Similarly, Redniss notes, the Curies' discovery of radium and its use as a tool for treating cancer is also the foundation of the knowledge that will bring us the atomic bomb.Then there's the artwork.""Cyanotype"" is a photographic processing technique that results in a distinctive blue tint - blueprints! - and is the basis of Redniss's work, although she goes on to paint and add to the basic backdrop throughout. The results are washes of bright color that often as not echo the content of the associated text. Or in the example above, the text on the right mirrors the positive space of the portrait on the left.Not to be leave anything to someone else's choices, she further designed her own font for the book. The details of the artwork and the design are included at the end of the book.I'm trying to keep in mind that all of the reasons I think this book is amazing and fantastic are the exact same reasons you might find it pretentious or cloying or overwrought or overly complicated. For me, it is a marvel of nonfiction storytelling that honors not only the subject's chronological life, but also the fallout of that life (Redniss's pun, not mine) and how one person (or one discovery) can ripple out forward. The metaphorical and symbolic possibilities of the artwork further enhance the writing by suggesting ideas and details without claiming them as written text would have to do, albeit perhaps with a caveat here and a caveat there.This is probably a work that will divide its readership quickly and easily. If you don't care for the artwork, you'll be turned away from the text. The structure is the next hurdle, but I'm willing to bet that if you embrace the first, you'll embrace the second."
18,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28699145-emily,5,"This is a unique and compelling book. What I like most about it is how Redniss intertwines not only the scientific and personal lives of Marie and Pierre Curie, but also the lives of many individuals who were influenced by the Curie's discoveries (directly or indirectly). While the overarching Curie story is told chronologically, the other stories are woven in at purposeful times and this makes the connections even more impactful and insightful. For instance, after Marie was contemplating the structure and energy of the atom, the next two pages simply show a picture of an atomic bomb test. This answers Marie's questions with startling force. One of the most moving side stories was of a Japanese girl, Sadae Kasaoka, who survived the bombing of Hiroshima. This was so vivid and moving that it was difficult to read. (view spoiler)[""Then I looked up and saw a strange scene. People, whose whole bodies looked whitish, had their hands up in front of their chests with something tattered hanging from them. They were staggering in procession toward the military hospital, covered in ash. That tattered thing was their peeling skin."" (hide spoiler)]Redniss uses text, color, layout, quotes, and chronology effectively to create a powerful glimpse into these two important lives and the countless lives that they affected. I use this book when I teach to illustrate the idea of discovery, and how we are continually building upon what has come before and are constantly learning new facets about ""old"" discoveries. I also desire to show how the monumental figures in history are affected in their daily lives and how they are connected with other people, other ideas, and other discoveries. "
19,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122151-jasmine,3,"okay this is my last review before I go on vacation. [yay!!!] and since I have no intention of talking to any of you while I'm on vacation [nothing personal I'm just not bringing my computer or talking to anyone who isn't my best friend] I better make it good. This book is perfectly fine. I is not worth the run on it that occurred, but I get why it didn't end up on back order like so many of the others and we got it in again pretty quick. it's nothing to write home about. BUT do not for a second think I'm saying this is a bad book. It's not, it's just not a great book. What do I mean? The art is seldom relevant to the pictures, it's beautiful but weird and unnecessary. There is a lot of text on each page in a very unpleasant font (subjectivity for the win). HOWEVER, I learned a lot from this book, like all the Marie Curie mythology total bull she knew the radiation was killing her, she wasn't some innocent idiot walking around carrying radium. Generally all the characters very cool people, they don't believe in patenting science, they all were pacifists. They are awesome. I think you could read this book to kids, it gets a little sexual, but those parts lean more towards the boring then the interestingly dirty so you could probably convince the kid to skip them. Or read them I mean kids are aware of sex aren't they? It's a good book for people who know nothing about marie curie [me] but aren't willing to spend more than a few hours learning about her. "
20,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"My husband gave this to me as an early Valentine's Day gift because he heard about it on NPR and knows me really well--I mean, how could I resist an art book that combines history, science and a love story? That GLOWS IN THE DARK? So yeah, it was an excellent gift. This is basically the story of Marie and Pierre Curie--their marriage and their work, and the things that came out of both aspects of their relationship. The narrative moves back and forth through history from the late 1800s/early 1900s up to present time, touching on Chernobyl, the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, Hiroshima, and many other parts of our world that have been affected in some way by the Curies' work. The art is beautiful and haunting, and though some reviewers have called it passionless, I have to disagree and say that it fits perfectly with the story Redniss is telling here. There's a lot of tragedy that surrounds the Curies and their work, and I think Redniss has done an excellent job of portraying that in her illustrations. And the typeface she created for this project also fits perfectly. It all adds up to make the story feel like a fairy tale.My only complaint about the book as a whole is that I felt the narrative didn't tell quite as clear of a story as I would have liked. But that's really only a minor problem in my mind--the presentation is so well done I almost don't even care. :)"

I found it very good. It is full of drawings and the text is embedded in the drawings. Apart from the biographic elements, there are also parts that describe the outcomes of the Curies' research, such as the story of a Hiroshima survivor, description of the Chernobyl explosion, nuclear tests in Nevada dessert etc.I learned many thing I didn't know. Did you know people used to decorate their stuff (such as telephone buttons and doorknobs) with radium? Noone knew the repercussions back then. Marie Curie was sleeping with the radium under her bed and she and her daughter were giving x-rays to hundreds of soldiers and stayed in the room. It is so interesting to learn all these things. I think I will read more biographies of scientists.Oh and I liked the general art-style of the book, the drawings are interesting, not what you would call typically pretty, but I liked it."
25,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5883209-rachel,3,"3.5 This was a good graphic novel. The pictures were a bit distracting and off at times but the information and story were good. The information about Marie Curie and her husband Pierre was really enlightening. It goes through the whole of Marie's life. It discusses the discoveries and science behind the discoveries. I almost forgot one thing that was distracting was the off shoot stories. There were a few of these which weren't directly a part of the story. They were about Radium or the atomic bomb or radiation. I found these a bit distracting and frustrating mainly at the end. There was one about the atomic bomb in Hiroshima, which I understood why the author included this woman's personal experiences but then I wanted to know what happened to her and it was only a couple page spread. A bit distracting from Marie's life. I did learn a lot from this and would recommend it. Also it was laying next to my bed when I went to sleep one night and the cover has glow in the dark art and I thought that was pretty cool. "
26,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923872-garrett-zecker,5,"Redniss' portrait of Marie and Pierre Curie was a completely surprising discovery. I was at the checkout at my local library when I saw it on the new arrivals shelf. While the librarian was completing some task for me, the cover jumped out, and I threw it on the stack after reading the quick blurb on the back. What I got was a brilliant – and I mean brilliant – surprise. Evidently, I knew little about the story of the Curies, so to begin, the actual story of their discovery, successes, failures, and mark they left on science, the outcome of the wars, and thousands upon thousands of things we take for granted in modern life is staggering. Marie and Pierre's relationship was beautiful, and so was the Hamilton-esque twists and turns that are presented in stark, well plotted organized chapters. In between much of the action, Redniss presents small intermissions that are directly related to the story thematically, albeit indirect consequences or historical moments that were a result of their work. Some are shocking, some fun, and some horrifically tragic. Finally, throughout the book Redniss has presented exquisite mixed-media artwork, all with a centerpiece of beautiful and haunting cyanotype artwork that illustrates the story. I was literally at the edge of my seat for this book, reading it twice through – once quickly in that manner one devours a book they are truly enjoying and a second time to savor some of the more poetic, beautiful moments (and visual masterpieces). Of course, I immediately told my wife she had to read it and recommended it to ten or fifteen of my friends – some with a particular fondness of the Hamilton-ness of the plot, while others would enjoy the stark, strong feminism that drove Curie's heart and mind. My true love for this book came in the middle of the night when, randomly waking to use the bathroom I stumbled through the dark and became shocked that the book was beckoning to me still. The ghostly apparition of it was looking straight at me, and it was only after waking up a little bit more did I realize that Redniss had one little extra easter egg for me in the sheer beauty of It Books' volume... A faint glow outlined the illustrations and the title, the ghostly radiation of Marie's visage stared at me in phosphorescent paint. If there was any question about whether or not I was in love with Redniss' book, they were gone. A truly magical, sad, beautiful, wonderful volume – so rare for adults in the modern era, that I can simply say I have never beheld the beauty of a book like it."
27,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11330925-mary,4,"This book is a work of art. The cover glows in the dark (radiation!) and the represenations inside are dramatic. The title is accurate. It is a story of love--both for Marie and Pierre together, but also for them with other partners, and for their children. It is a story of fallout because working with radiation had terrible effects on their health. In a larger sense, the fallout was healing for radiation therapy and x-ray diagnoses, but destructive in other terrible ways with nuclear weapons.The narrative was disjointed at times when we jumped from the Curies to modern day uses of radioactivity. Also as lovely as the book was, the print on bright orange or yellow pages was hard to read. "
28,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13339635-jessica-rosner,5,"Amazing true story, gorgeous artwork.I knew too little about Marie Curie. Not only a genius, but a flesh and blood heroine and moral compass (though her lover’s wife might disagree).She devoted herself and devoured herself in her quest to learn about and use the powers of radium. This brilliant book also reveals how in our relatively short history the United States made shameful choices (atomic testing in populated areas, questioning by the despicable HUAC of some of the best and brightest, instilling a fear of Russians to act as scapegoat for our own deeds) by weaving in stories about where science led us, for good and evil."

I didn’t expect to love it as much as it did, but it’s haunting, it’s informative, it’s so well thought out. It’s just good. The effort that Redniss put into the creation of this book really shows. I loved her storytelling skills and the flip between Marie Curie’s present and the fallout/ripples of her life in the future. I’m so happy I had the chance to see the film adaptation, which led me to this beautiful piece of work. "
30,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11442903-james,5,"This rating is just slightly inflated because the narrative isn't as coherent as I want it to be, but the artwork and satisfying art-object-ness that Redness obsessively created (a brand new font! glow in the dark paint that is slowly decaying!) makes it so, so beautiful. When the first bomb dropped in Pt. 3 I held my breath. The genealogy of genius in the families somehow feels fascinating and not like smart-people porn."

It covers her scientific achievements but also provides the reader with a sense of who the Curies were and the deep affection that underpinned their scientific collaboration. The book also touches on her affair with Paul Langevin but does not overly sensationalize what was, without a doubt, a major and very public scandal in her life. The artwork is beautiful and haunting. Well worth picking this up if you're curious about women in science, Marie Curie, or graphic novels as a form for biography."
37,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112265-katie,4,"In Radioactive, Lauren Redniss depicts the lives and work of Marie and Pierre Curie through a combination of text and illustrations. Interspersed within this narrative are related stories about the lasting effects their work, mostly that which concerned radioactivity. These include accounts of major events like the Hiroshima bombing, Three Mile Island, and Chernobyl. It also includes other stories about those who go to radon mines for the supposed health benefits, factory workers in the 1920s who became ill from putting paint brushes dipped in radium in their mouths to achieve the fine strokes needed for painting glowing watches, and cancer survivors treated with radiation. I really liked the illustrations in this book. Quite a few illustrations in this book are created by something called cyanotype printing that creates really compelling images in blue and white. (If you aren’t familiar with it, do a Google image search.) In her afterward, Redniss talks about the reasons she used this technique. One, it makes it appear as though the image is glowing internally, capturing radium’s luminosity. Second, the process uses the principles of photographic imaging, which was central to radioactivity, and finally, the chemicals produced by cyanotype printing can also be used to treat the effects of exposure to certain types of radiation. I found these images very striking before reading her reasons for using them, and hearing her reasons made them even more compelling. The cyanotype prints were beautiful, yet at the same time eerie and rather haunting. It highlights the idea that amidst all the excitement surrounding these incredible discoveries, there is this undertone of something just plain sad, knowing how invisibly poisonous the work environment was and all the bad that would come from the principles they were working to uncover. While reading this book, I wavered between utter amazement of people’s ability to understand and manipulate our complex world and a complete fear of the exact same thing. So much good and bad can come from same scientific principles. The Curies, like so many other scientists of the era, feared the evil that would come from their work. What a complicated dilemma, to be so intelligent and passionate about your work, committed to knowledge sharing in the scientific community, but at the same time knowing what this knowledge can be used for. On a happy note, there are other practical applications for the work of the Curies. The principles of the Curie point, which is a relationship between heat and magnetism, are used in plate tectonics, measuring caffeine in beverages, and treating hypothermia. The principle of piezoelectricity is used in propelling droplets in inkjet printers, controlling the beeps of smoke detectors, and reducing vibrations in tennis rackets. I don’t really understand these concepts, but it is nice to think about the scientists sitting around trying to figure out how to measure the caffeine content of coffee or how to make a smoke detector beep and not just those scientists making bombs. I loved one of the photographs in the book that showed Marie Curie lecturing to a classroom entirely filled with men. Way to go, Marie! "
38,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15425257-althea-j,4,"I think Hannah captures the feel of this book beautifully in her review, you should check it out.I enjoyed this book viscerally, but it also spoke to a particular interest of mine --- I get super jazzed when I come across a work that would make an EXCELLENT teaching tool. Specifically, I'm currently fascinated by how graphic novels can be used in the classroom to spark students' interest and heighten their learning experience. Now, before you run screaming from this book because I mentioned its educative capacity, I should note that one of the features that makes it so promising is that it looks NOTHING like your typical boring old textbook. It is a graphic novel hybrid that combines gorgeous full page artwork with engaging text, telling the story of the Curies, interspersed with historical information and interviews that span to the present day.I'll try to keep this brief, but in case anyone is interested, here are the bulletpoint reasons I think this book would make a stellar addition to the syllabus of high school chemistry classes. - The narrative describing the Curies brings them to life in a relatable way. These aren't just famous scientists who discovered x, y and z. They are people who had their hearts broken, sought out academic opportunities that fed their ambition, found passion for discovery, found love in one another in an intellectual partnership, were driven by curiosity, and who had human flaws. How can we expect young people to envision themselves as scientists if we don't take these figures off pedestals and encourage them to see the people behind their legend? - Redniss ties in important events relating to radioactivity that happened outside of the Curies' timeline and life narrative (The Manhattan Project, Hiroshima, Chernobyl...) in a way that directly connects the Curies' work to future scientific discoveries, uses, and general historical context. This gave me, as the reader, a much broader understanding and allowed me to draw interesting connections.  - A lot of the complicated science was presented in an accessible way. To be honest, I didn't fully grasp certain concepts, but I imagine that the questions that were raised in my head, and potentially students' minds, would serve as excellent jumping off points for more in depth discussion of the concepts in a classroom setting. And nothing motivates a student's active engagement like a question that they want answered. - Several of the historical events that were brought up (like Chernobyl and 3-Mile Island) were presented in a way that left me hungry to know more about them. This is one of my favorite indicators of educative capacity -- the extent to which a work inspires a student to want to pursue more information. This book is a great starting point that will likely spark an interest in the subject and has a ton of potential for provoking future avenues of self-directed learning."
39,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/221119-sara-latta,5,"""Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie. A Tale of Love and Fallout"" (Harper Collins, 2011), by Lauren Redniss, is a fascinating scientific biography of the famous couple and their family. Along with Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1903 for their pioneering work in radioactivity (Marie herself coined the word ""radioactivity""). Marie won a second Nobel Prize in 1911 for her discovery of radium and polonium; in 1935, their daughter and son-in-law, Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie garnered the Nobel Prize for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. 	Redniss interweaves her story of the Curies’ scientific progress with accounts of the many ways--both positive and negative--in which their research has touched our lives. There is a moving profile of a Japanese woman who watched her father die after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima as well as an interview with a young man who was successfully treated for an aggressive tumor with radiation therapy. 	""Radioactive"" is also a deeply affecting romance. ""With the constant companionship that accompanied their research,"" Redniss writes, ""the Curies' love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwriting intermingle in their notebooks. On the cover of one black canvas laboratory log, the initials ""M"" and ""P"" are scripted directly one atop the other."" Their romantic and scientific collaboration was cut short in 1906 when Pierre was struck and killed by a horse-drawn carriage. A few years after Pierre's death, Marie had an affair with a married man that provoked such a scandal that she was advised not to attend the Nobel ceremony where she was to accept her second prize (she went anyway). Marie died in 1934 as a result of prolonged exposure to radiation; it surely would have killed Pierre as well if the horse hadn't done so first.	Last, ""Radioactive"" is a remarkable work of art; it is simply a beautiful book. Redniss illustrates her text with photographs, line drawings, and cyanotope prints that seem to glow with the luminosity of radium. Even the choice of using cyanotype printing ties into the theme of radioactivity. The process uses light-sensitive chemicals that form a compound commonly known as Prussian blue, an approved treatment for exposure to certain types of radioactivity. 	There is even an amusing ""Radioactive Bestiary and Garden"" at the end of the book, featuring (among others) Spider-Man, who gained his superhuman abilities after being bitten by an irradiated spider, and Brazil nuts, the world's most naturally radioactive food. 	""Radioactive"" is not specifically marketed as a book for young adults, but the science is accessible enough for most teens. Redniss' gorgeous artwork will win over readers with a more artistic bent. This is bound to be one of my favorite books of the year. Review first published in the News-Gazette, April 24, 2011.

Rarely reads history or biography. Picked book up on a whim. Possibly compensating for tendencies in self and others to rate high.)""It was okay"" sounds about right.I respect the author's experimental approach to the non-fiction book format, but some aspects work better than others. The integration of art adds certain feels, but unevenness of production is a bit distracting for me. The typeface Redniss designed for the book works for the shorter lines coupled with visuals, but they become unreadable walls of text beyond that. Rhythm changes are incorporated, with varying success. Interdependent professional and personal life is a major theme of the content, mirrored in its form. Chapter heads have double meanings, focus flips back and forth strategically, quotes foreshadow... but the content soon becomes scattered. Transitions deteriorate. The author brings in many interesting stories from after the Curies' time, but doesn't seem to know quite how to integrate them. After, jumping back in time is a struggle. Her effort to remove herself from the content, to remain ""objective"" outside structural choices, editing, and the surprise note section, sometimes takes away from the heart of the book, and its integrative approach. Overall, lots of interesting things going on. The author has good intentions, and makes many clever decisions, so my objects of ridicule may be intentional conceptual choices. Regardless, execution needs tweaking. I hope Redniss keeps making things. "
41,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,5,"Besides researching and writing this book, the author designed its type and created its art work. She used paper coated with light sensitive materials, imaging which was critical to the discovery of X-Rays and radiology. Lauren Redniss well deserves the National Book Award nomination for her writing and for her bibliographic art.The book has the feel of its content. The use of color illustration and positioning of type on the page evoke the images of radiation both good and the bad. The story is both tender and sad with just the right color and drawings - light or heavy as the story commands.While the ""fallout"" of the Curies' work is well known, the story of their lives is not. The man of this couple, which jointly ushered in the modern world, was killed in a horse and carriage accident and later, the woman's next partner fought 5 duels over her honor. Their daughter went on, with her spouse - a protégé of the dueler - to win a Nobel for the discovery of artificial radioactivity.The legacy of their discoveries from life saving uses in medical technology to life extinguishing uses in bombs, to environmental havoc of power plant melt downs are portrayed. The political side is shown in portraits of those who sacrificed to warn of the dangers.This is not an in depth study, nor does it purport to be. It is a tribute to the Curie family, with special emphasis on Marie. It is a breakthrough in book design and in presenting complex scientific material, personal relationships and social and political currents of history."
42,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5013497-mark,5,"I had heard the name Marie Curie, but I did not know much about this pioneering scientist. Wow, what an eye-opener. She was born in Poland in 1867 and moved to Paris in 1891, to study science at the University of Paris. A couple years later, she meets Pierre Curie, an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry. They soon marry and begin blazing a path, that will bring both wonder to the world and incredible destruction.This all will launch, with their discovery of polonium and radium, which sets off a long list of breakthroughs, leading to “radioactivity”, a term they both coined. I think we know where this is heading.I am not much of a science geek, but I do not think there has ever been a pairing, in the history of science, that has reached these monumental achievements. The couple ended up winning the Nobel Peace Prize for physics and eight years later, Marie earned a second one for chemistry.Yes, this wonderful graphic biography, is a love story and a scientific history lesson but it is also explores the horrible repercussions: “The Fallout” part of the title. Hiroshima, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl make appearances, along with a few lesser horror stories featuring the evils of radiation.I cannot express how perfect this all comes together, with simple illustrations and a vibrant palette of colors, all held together with a strong narrative drive. Find this book!"
43,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076553-nicole,5,"It's a biography of the Curies but also a work of art. The illustrations tell their own narrative as beautifully as the text. It truly made me care about the Curies and their era in a way that I wouldn't have normally. In addition to the gorgeous pictures, the author includes stories you probably would never had heard anywhere else. For example, she tells about all the young women in New Jersey who were hired to paint watch dials with the ""undark"" paint that was made from radium, who subsequently came down with all sorts of horrible symptoms (up to and including death) from twisting the paintbrushes between their lips to keep the tip sharp. She also tells how the Curies were so fascinated by their new-found element that they would take it home in a jar and show it off at dinner parties--in fact, Marie even used a stick of radium as a nightlight for a while. And, get this, after Pierre's death, Marie took up with a married man and her lover nearly fought a duel to defend her honor against a newspaper columnist (take that 20th-century TMZ). All the while, Redniss is paralleling the lives of the Curies with the ""life"" that radium takes on. There are interviews with cancer survivors whose lives were saved by radiation. There's an interview with a survivor of Hiroshima. And I have to admit, the bit about the buttercups made me cry. You'll see what I mean."
44,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30119-korri,3,"Considering that the last biography I read about Marie Curie was the 1979 ValueTale The Value of Learning: The Tale of Marie Curie, I was looking forward to a more sophisticated book. The illustrations, made by cyanotype printing, seem to cast a glow not dissimilar to radium's 'spontaneous luminosity'. While the making of the images is interesting, the art itself is very simple and feels more like doodles than finished work. The biography starts with the Curies' childhoods and charts their love and research, the latter rendered in comprehensible language for the non-science-y reader. The subtitle of the book (A Tale of Love and Fallout) refers not only to the couple's relationship but to the nuclear implications or fallout of their work. While this aspect of the book is very important and interesting, the placement of asides about cancer radiation, a member of the Manhattan Project, Hiroshima, 'Doom Towns', Chernobyl, etc feel off; they seem to disrupt instead of flow from the biographical narrative. Laura Redniss has created a disjointed art/biography but, since I get distracted by pretty things and since it has taught me new information, I rather liked it."

Once exposed to the sun’s UV rays, this chemically-treated paper turns a deep blue color. The text in the book is a unique typeface Redniss designed using the title pages of 18th- and 19th-century manuscripts from the New York Public Library archive. She named it Eusapia LR, for the croquet-playing, sexually ravenous Italian Spiritualist medium whose séances the Curies used to attend. The book’s cover is printed in glow-in-the-dark ink....Stunningly beautiful in both concept and execution, Radioactive is a rare cross-pollination of art and science, the kind of storytelling that makes us care about stories.""Who can resist the lure of a book like this?

It’s filled with vivid art and easy to read text. I especially liked the inclusion of various other information and tidbits relating back to the Curie’s work and the interconnectedness between their work and other scientists.Not only is it informational and crafted with stunning illustrations, Redniss took extra care in showcasing all that could be possible in sharing a biographical work - adding special features from the font of the text to the ink the pages are printed in.Also, a really awesome perk, some sections glow in the dark, just like the radioactive materials Marie and Pierre Curie discovered.It’s a beautiful book and a must have for your personal library.Read if you like: non fiction - biography, science, graphic novels, illustrated works, "
47,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5748595-amanda,4,"This was a strange and intriguing book. I'm not sure if I've read anything like it...the closest I can compare it to would be the Griffin & Sabine books. Radioactive is a dual history of Pierre and Marie Curie's discoveries in radioactivity and the impact those discoveries have made on history, coupled with the personal stories of several characters, with a focus on Marie Curie. I don't think I've thought once about the Curies since I graduated high school (science is not my forte), but I'm glad I learned more about them and their work. This is a large-sized book, with a mix of collage, drawing, old photographs, and articles all meshed together. It is really beautiful. Redniss has this unique device where she switches back and forth from the Curies' history to random accounts by other scientists, workers in nuclear energy today, or even victims of the Hiroshima bombing. At first, it's jarring, but then I realized that each interruption was meant to make the reader think of the consequences of the Curies' research in radioactivity, something they thought was exciting and full of possibility. The book elucidates both the beauty and the horror of radioactivity without thumping you over the head with it. "

I was fascinated, even if I didn’t quite get everything I read.The minute I saw this book, I knew it was a book that I had to read.

I finally broke down and bought it.It was a worthwhile purchase. I’d classify it as a graphic novel, a picture book for grownups, with brilliant illustrations that add to the text. Lauren Redniss, who wrote the text and created the illustrations, tells the story of Marie and Pierre Curie, a story of the power and destruction that came with the discovery of radiation.

As far as the detail goes, I don't just mean the personal touches Redniss adds with the interviews, but also that her very artistic process using a font face she designed from New York Library manuscripts and cyanotype prints that make each drawing seem to have a radioactive glow...plus the book itself also glows in the dark.Redniss also makes this more than a simple love story - it's complicated by the historical fallout (pun intended) of the Curies' research and questions around science, ethics, and personal responsibility.This was the first book I've picked up recently that made me realize that not all books are going to work electronically - there's no way you could read this on an iPad even if it were available and have the same experience.

New York Times
.HT:http://www.slate.com/id/2280395/, as emailed to me by my mother.This book glows in the dark! Just like radium!...Do you think that it has radium in it?For some reason the title here does not give the proper subtitle: ""A Tale of Love and Fallout"".Marie Curie was in what we would now call grad school from 1895-1903 (eight years), and had a baby in 1897 (her third year). In 1903, Marie Curie became the first woman to earn a doctorate in France, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for her work later that year. Why isn't the turnaround that fast today?She did earn her doctorate, and inherited Pierre's professorship after his untimely death, so I'm not entirely sure why we call her ""Mme Curie"" and not ""Prof. Curie"" or ""Dr. Curie""."

The graphics immersed you into this book, as well as the clever way Redniss interspersed the linear timeline of Marie Curie's life with seemingly random (but highly relevant) vignettes regarding radiation, accidents, and science. There was just enough details to give me an understanding of Curie's work without devolving into a scientific treatise. I was left wanting to know more and wondering why Hollywood has completely failed to bring this important woman to life on the silver screen. The tragedy of the untimely death of her husband, her highly controversial love affair with fellow scientist Paul Langevin, and the fact she is the first PERSON (let alone woman) to win two Nobel Prizes would make for a thrilling film adaptation.My library is featuring this work as our Book to Art Club selection, and I could not be more pleased.

Barely 200 pages, not very long especially when you consider the large amount of illustrations and cyanotype printing (as the author notes, it makes the illustrations glow with the same luster that Curie used to describe radium). I learned a lot about Marie and Pierre Curie and the vast influence their discoveries and research has had on our world - most for the better but some unfortunately for the worst. I found myself frequently reading bits and pieces of this aloud to my family and now my 13 year old son is reading it too. He's especially interested in the Chernobyl information. I really liked learning about how radium was used and misused and how Curie wasn't just the first woman to win 2 Noble Prizes in her life, she was the first scientist to ever win twice-you go girl! "

Consequently, Marie and Pierre's courtship is interwoven with explanations about radium and x-ray technology; Marie's unhappy affair after her husband's death is interwoven with the horrors of Chernobyl and Hiroshima. The author elegantly titles her chapters (""Symmetry,"" ""Magnetism,"" ""Fusion,"" etc.) with scientific/romantic double entendres, adding to the sexiness of it all. Though the project falls a tad short of its mark, it's a case of ""shoot for the moon and if you miss you will still be among the stars."" Satisfying and thought-provoking. "

Judging by the title, I expected something more like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Much more emotionally involved and actually trying to get the reader involved in her, not just the science. Also, the images looked like they were drawn by a small child without the effect of being adorably odd. Now, usually there is a reason to illustrate things a certain way, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out the significance of drawing that way. Altogether a disjointed novel. I wouldn't recommend it unless it were to be studied academically."

While I expected to learn more about the work of the Curies, the author brought me to Hiroshima, Chernobyl, Three-Mile Island and far beyond. These were both unexpected diversions, unexplained and curious. I'm still not sure what to make of the information presented, but it is unlike anything I ever read. And then there are the illustrations: cyanotype prints of lovely/ugly figures, city scapes, and crystals. The illustrations are bold, odd and beautiful; capturing the complexity of the story presented. "

But the narrative is a little bit all over the place, making the ultimate effect seem more like a notebook of stuff related to radioactivity than a love story about Maria Skłodowska and Pierre Curie. There is a sudden, jolting aside about Oppenheimer that seems to set the stage for a series of tangents. I appreciate the inclusion of maps of Chernobyl and Hiroshima, but the way it's done makes it seem like an interruption rather than an organic connection. A visual pleasure, and a really interesting book, just not _quite_ as good as I wish it was. "

86,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66323993-pvoberstein,3,"Radioactive: A Tale of Love and Fallout is an unusual graphic biography by author-illustrator Lauren Redniss. It has recently been adapted into a film directed by Marjane Satrapi (of 
Persepolis
 fame), which is how it came to my attention, though I have yet to see the movie. Redniss tells the stories of Marie and Pierre Curie, two of the most important scientific minds of the early 20th century, chronicling both their personal and scientific lives.Some who understands art could give a much better description than myself, but I found Redniss’ style to be something of a cross between Pablo Picasso and Terry Gilliam. I’m admittedly ambivalent on the aesthetic aspects of it, though the cyanotype printing process that Redniss employed does beautifully fit with the themes of the work. The whole book is permeated with a certain sadness, one which comes from the reader knowing what radiation poisoning is, unlike the pioneers of radiation theory.The work itself is somewhat hard to classify, sometimes shifting between dry biographical prose and “fairy tale” poetry, interspersed with discursive discussions about everything from Hiroshima to Chernobyl, and even a few primary documents. In terms of sheer factual content it’s not particularly dense – you’d probably learn just as much reading a few Encyclopædia Britannica articles – but it’s the way that the story is told that grabs you. Redniss clearly did her research – the endnotes are filled with references to the personal papers of the Curies themselves – and has interviewed a wide spectrum of individuals with some connection to the world of radioactivity. (Though I’m going to be a pedantic nitpicker and point out that the original Godzilla was not created by hydrogen bomb fallout, as the “Radioactive Bestiary and Garden” alleges, but merely awakened from His ancient slumber by hydrogen bomb testing.)On the whole, Radioactive does a good job of providing humanizing insights into the life of Marie Curie, but struggles a little when trying to explain where she fits in to the history of scientific discovery. Much of the discursive sections seem to hold the Curies at least partially responsible for the world of nuclear weapons that followed them. While there are brief discussions of the other scientists who paved the way for the Manhattan Project, I think the framing places too much credit/blame on the Curies for the secondary consequences of their discoveries. Great if you’re searching for nuggets about the lives and the world of the Curies, but it should definitely be supplementing some other source."
87,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3307682-jenn-lebow,0,"This week I took Einstein, Blossom, and Ladybug in for their annual portraits. A toy store sits right next door to the portrait place. In the window sat Ladybug’s bliss: a giant plush Sesame Street Abby Cadabby doll. Abby easily stands four feet tall. Ladybug has talked about it for three days straight, and she has a birthday coming up. I love the idea of her opening a huge box on her birthday, finding Abby, and flinging her arms around Abby’s fairy wings, so I stopped to ask the price.Well. It was prohibitive, at least when weighed against our usual spending range for birthdays. Plus, there’s no telling with kiddos. Maybe she would love it for years; maybe she’d ditch it in the corner after a few days. Either way, the cost was more than I was willing to pay.In contrast, for the three authors whose books I’m reviewing this month, the costs faced could not stop wholehearted pursuit of a passion. In fact, paying the price left each of the women in a freer place than before. Anne Lamott, Yoani Sánchez, and Lauren Redniss delineate the workings of hearts entranced in their respective books Some Assembly Required, Havana Real, and Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout.Anne Lamott, whether you find her infuriating or delightful, never shies away from facing up to her own faults. By her own admission, she loves to helpfully meddle in the lives of her people, and she ruefully confesses her realization that “helpful” often sounds like “interference.” However, Anne encounters, early in this account, a love she can’t ignore or resist: love for her newborn grandson, Jax, a baby whose pull is almost magnetic in its involuntary force.In the wake of her love for Jax, Anne gives up (for the most part) something she might otherwise have justified, even to herself: her “right” to meddle with her son, and co-author, Sam and his girlfriend, Amy. Jax’s parents. Anne finds, to her astonishment, that as her love for Jax grows, so does her ability to allow Sam and Amy to parent as they will, to relate as they wish, to decide on their own future, and Jax’s, without her input. Or at least without all of it.This ability allows her to embrace a shared moment with Sam at a Hindu meditation gathering. On a later trip to India, Anne receives a conference call arranged by the leader of that gathering. The ensuing conversation, mostly shouts from the leader, punctuated by bursts of affection from Sam, Amy, and Anne, leaves her laughing, crying, and grateful.In true Lamott fashion, an irrepressible faith and sink-into-able love win out. Anne and Sam Lamott light the way for many who, as grandparents, will need to pay the cost of such an overwhelming love – the cost of keeping out of the parents’ finding their way. And Anne does this in a mostly gracious, always humorous, way when she writes, “Because I’m human, which is to say crazy in some respects, and some people who shall remain nameless tricked me into loving them too deeply and ruined my life.”Though the humor is wryer in Havana Real, Yoani Sánchez’ collection of posts from her popular (and banned in her native Cuba) blog, Generación Y, Sánchez’ indelible optimism and determination comes through clearly. Sánchez, a native of Havana, moved to Switzerland in 2002, but returned to Cuba – against the advice of family and friends – in 2004. Determined to live freely, Yoani started her blog to tell her own story of her experience as an everyday Cuban facing difficulties under the longstanding Castro regime. Since then, as her book details, she has been blocked from her own blog when it was removed from public servers available in Cuba. But beyond that, officials keep her under surveillance, refuse her entrance to public gatherings, and have abducted and beaten her.Still, Yoani blogs on, and not only writes her own blog, but trains other Cubans to begin their own blogs. From her efforts, dozens of Cubans are telling their stories to the world.Why would she risk everything to do this? Why would she come back from living in comfort and freedom in Switzerland, putting herself in danger and by her own admission, giving her beloved son Teo a rockier childhood than he otherwise might have had? As I read, one main reason impressed itself on me: Yoani Sánchez loves her country and longs for its freedom more than she values her comfort. As she writes, “I have indeed committed a heinous offense: I have believed myself to be free… I refuse to accept the systematic swatting at my ‘rights as a citizen’… [T]hough I have never stolen anything from others, they want to ‘steal’ again and again, that which I believe belongs to me: an island, its dreams, its legacy.”The legacy left by the subject of Lauren Redniss’ visually stunning book Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout, Marie Curie, is almost incalculable. Marie, born in Poland, emigrated to France to pursue a career in science. The first passion that caused her to leave something else behind was her love for Pierre Curie. Their work-and-love affair achieved an importance to Marie that even overrode her deep desire to return to Poland. Pierre, Redniss writes, “saw a woman who would not fetter his scientific ambitions but rather act as collaborator, muse, and guide.”In a mix of haunting artwork, explanations of the Curies’ work, and modern-day uses and consequences of their discoveries (inkjet printers use technology that Pierre Curie invented), Redniss argues that the Curies’ devotion to their scientific careers gave them deep satisfaction. “With the constant companionship that accompanied their research, the Curies’ love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwritings intermingle in their notebooks.”The Curies discovered radium and polonium (named for Marie’s beloved Poland), and spent years observing their effects. “The Curies had demonstrated the existence of radium and polonium through their radioactivity, but fellow scientists remained skeptical. It was as if the elements had been grasped only by shadows, and so could be considered no more definitive than, say, the word of a Spiritualist medium. Chemists in particular wanted to see them, to touch them. Only concrete evidence would be persuasive.”It took the Curies four years to distill 1/10 of a gram of radium chloride from raw materials.Passion for science, and their work with radium, cost them a great deal of time, but more importantly, it began to cost them their health. Marie was too ill to travel to Stockholm to accept their first Nobel Prize. She suffered miscarriages and developed fibrous lesions. Pierre grew so ill he had to resign his post at the Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry at the Sorbonne. Redniss writes, “Radioactivity had made the Curies immortal. Now it was killing them.”Still, in the face of health concerns, Marie’s passion for scientific discovery allowed her to view her own symptoms as information, her own mortality useful in her pursuit of scientific advancement. She “chronicled her own deterioration as laboratory data,” including on her charts her temperature, color and amount of urine, and amount of pain.Marie Curie died of anemia due to radiation exposure. She, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, had won two when she died. Her professorship at the Sorbonne was the first time in 650 years of the university’s existence that a woman earned one. Her daughter Irène won a Nobel Prize with her husband. Her granddaughter Hélène became a nuclear physicist, her grandson Pierre a biophysicist. The work she did with her husband has had lasting effects on our lives. Radiation is still used to fight cancer, to give one example, and of course atomic bombs come to mind.For all of these women, a love stronger than their love for themselves caused them to consider what price this new love was worth. Thankfully, all three of these authors chose to chronicle devotion, to give us the chance to learn how to calculate and navigate those choices for ourselves. "
88,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71679987-anika-utke,5,"The vivid chemically composed, cyanotype printed illustrations perfectly set the mood and tone to tell Marie Curie’s story in Laura Redniss’s Radioactive. Beginning the narrative is a preface “with apologies to Marie Curie, who said ‘There is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life (Redniss, 6).”’ Though later the reader will discover the context of this quote is in regards to a high profile sex scandal Marie Curie was involved in, the question remains: Would Curie have wanted this? Does Redniss cross a line by going against Curie’s wishes to tell her story in a way that centers upon the crossing of Marie’s science with her personal life? I don’t have an answer, though maybe Marie Curie would have with those weird ghost seances her and Pierre involved themselves in. However, I do believe this novel is on a similar level to that of Art Spiegelman’s Maus. That story followed Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, through his survival of The Holocaust while interweaving the personal relationship of the two into a highly creative and symbolic graphic novel. And for all these elements, the story was highly effective. Perhaps more so than it would have been if it were merely written down. What better way to represent the story of the Curies than by producing it with a form of chemical science of its own: cyanotype printing? Thus, while it may offend the sensible wishes of its subject, I feel like this new lens on Curie’s life was not only poignant, but highly successful. In creating a cross referencing narrative that spans from Curie’s relationships forged out of brilliant scientific partnerships that emboldens her work, to the heartbreak and scandal she endured all while becoming the first to win two Nobel prizes for her work in radioactivity, the extent of her accomplishments are fully realized. The addition of snippets from the future that highlight the importance and ramifications her work would go on to have also add to a complex narrative of complex human beings. In my seventh grade science class, I first heard of Marie Curie. She was a poster among a wall of other posters of male scientists. I felt far removed when hearing about her, as the science didn’t mean much to me. However, this novel serves to better humanize its subjects to connect with audiences that may not otherwise have paid much attention. Despite the fact that the book is formatted in a creative new approach to Curie through stylistic illustration, I find this doesn’t mean the novel is anyway lesser. It simply offers a wider range of audience to learn about Marie Curie. For a younger audience, for those whose brains lean more artistically than scientifically, for those who are drawn in by the stories of human love and tragedy rather than humans loving beakers and green glowy things, Redniss has offered Marie Curie a new perspective and a new set of ears interested in keeping her story alive."
89,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665098-mark,5,"Wow. Just Wow. This book is like none that I have read. It is hard to describe because it is many things, but not exactly like any particular type of book. It resembles a graphic novel. It resembles an art book. It resembles a biography. It resembles a history of radioactivity.  The story is framed by a biography of Marie Curie, the narrative includes her love story with her husband husband Pierre and the lover she took as a widow, Paul Langevin. It also describes her scientific partnership with both men which led to Madam Curie winning two Nobel Prizes in Physics (The discovery of radioactivity) and Chemistry (The discovery of the elements Polonium and Radium). The discovery of radium is one of the most tenacious and persistent stories in science. Marie and Pierre took 5 tons of pitchblende ore and separated a few specs of radium chloride over a four year process of back breaking chemical separation and purification. The final steps required were primarily through multiple recrystallizations with each step slowly producing a slightly more pure product. All of these was done in an inadequate abandoned shed formally used for human dissection in the med school, using crude tools like iron kettles and heavy rods to stir the mixtures. The continuation of the scientific work ws carried out by the Curie's daughter and son and law, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. This second generation's scientific work led to another Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Discovery of synthetic radioactive elements). Like Nobel's invention of dynamite before him Frédéric Joliot-Curie wished his work to be carried only for the good of man, but his work provided the key step that lead to the creation of nuclear weaponsInterspersed in the main story are historical accounts on radioactivity such as the Hiroshima bombing, the sad fate of women who painted luminous watch dials with radium paint, atomic bomb testing, development of nuclear power, radioactivity in medicine, Three Mile Island, and the Chernobyl disaster.Every page that is not a photographer is a work of art created by the author inspired by the words on the page. She used a technique called cyanotype printing whereby she applied a solution to paper and masked it with the negative of her desired drawing. Exposure to sunlight creates the pigment Prussian Blue. A water rinse removes the solution from the masked areas. She indicates this process is relative because the final result is similar to the glowing described by Marie Curie of radium, it involves photography which was key in the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity, and Prussian Blue itself is used to treat radioactive poisoning. It is a short read, but a deep work of both art and literature."

Persepolis
 fame), which is how it came to my attention, though I have yet to see the movie. Redniss tells the stories of Marie and Pierre Curie, two of the most important scientific minds of the early 20th century, chronicling both their personal and scientific lives.Some who understands art could give a much better description than myself, but I found Redniss’ style to be something of a cross between Pablo Picasso and Terry Gilliam. I’m admittedly ambivalent on the aesthetic aspects of it, though the cyanotype printing process that Redniss employed does beautifully fit with the themes of the work. The whole book is permeated with a certain sadness, one which comes from the reader knowing what radiation poisoning is, unlike the pioneers of radiation theory.The work itself is somewhat hard to classify, sometimes shifting between dry biographical prose and “fairy tale” poetry, interspersed with discursive discussions about everything from Hiroshima to Chernobyl, and even a few primary documents. In terms of sheer factual content it’s not particularly dense – you’d probably learn just as much reading a few Encyclopædia Britannica articles – but it’s the way that the story is told that grabs you. Redniss clearly did her research – the endnotes are filled with references to the personal papers of the Curies themselves – and has interviewed a wide spectrum of individuals with some connection to the world of radioactivity. (Though I’m going to be a pedantic nitpicker and point out that the original Godzilla was not created by hydrogen bomb fallout, as the “Radioactive Bestiary and Garden” alleges, but merely awakened from His ancient slumber by hydrogen bomb testing.)On the whole, Radioactive does a good job of providing humanizing insights into the life of Marie Curie, but struggles a little when trying to explain where she fits in to the history of scientific discovery. Much of the discursive sections seem to hold the Curies at least partially responsible for the world of nuclear weapons that followed them. While there are brief discussions of the other scientists who paved the way for the Manhattan Project, I think the framing places too much credit/blame on the Curies for the secondary consequences of their discoveries. Great if you’re searching for nuggets about the lives and the world of the Curies, but it should definitely be supplementing some other source."
117,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3307682-jenn-lebow,0,"This week I took Einstein, Blossom, and Ladybug in for their annual portraits. A toy store sits right next door to the portrait place. In the window sat Ladybug’s bliss: a giant plush Sesame Street Abby Cadabby doll. Abby easily stands four feet tall. Ladybug has talked about it for three days straight, and she has a birthday coming up. I love the idea of her opening a huge box on her birthday, finding Abby, and flinging her arms around Abby’s fairy wings, so I stopped to ask the price.Well. It was prohibitive, at least when weighed against our usual spending range for birthdays. Plus, there’s no telling with kiddos. Maybe she would love it for years; maybe she’d ditch it in the corner after a few days. Either way, the cost was more than I was willing to pay.In contrast, for the three authors whose books I’m reviewing this month, the costs faced could not stop wholehearted pursuit of a passion. In fact, paying the price left each of the women in a freer place than before. Anne Lamott, Yoani Sánchez, and Lauren Redniss delineate the workings of hearts entranced in their respective books Some Assembly Required, Havana Real, and Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout.Anne Lamott, whether you find her infuriating or delightful, never shies away from facing up to her own faults. By her own admission, she loves to helpfully meddle in the lives of her people, and she ruefully confesses her realization that “helpful” often sounds like “interference.” However, Anne encounters, early in this account, a love she can’t ignore or resist: love for her newborn grandson, Jax, a baby whose pull is almost magnetic in its involuntary force.In the wake of her love for Jax, Anne gives up (for the most part) something she might otherwise have justified, even to herself: her “right” to meddle with her son, and co-author, Sam and his girlfriend, Amy. Jax’s parents. Anne finds, to her astonishment, that as her love for Jax grows, so does her ability to allow Sam and Amy to parent as they will, to relate as they wish, to decide on their own future, and Jax’s, without her input. Or at least without all of it.This ability allows her to embrace a shared moment with Sam at a Hindu meditation gathering. On a later trip to India, Anne receives a conference call arranged by the leader of that gathering. The ensuing conversation, mostly shouts from the leader, punctuated by bursts of affection from Sam, Amy, and Anne, leaves her laughing, crying, and grateful.In true Lamott fashion, an irrepressible faith and sink-into-able love win out. Anne and Sam Lamott light the way for many who, as grandparents, will need to pay the cost of such an overwhelming love – the cost of keeping out of the parents’ finding their way. And Anne does this in a mostly gracious, always humorous, way when she writes, “Because I’m human, which is to say crazy in some respects, and some people who shall remain nameless tricked me into loving them too deeply and ruined my life.”Though the humor is wryer in Havana Real, Yoani Sánchez’ collection of posts from her popular (and banned in her native Cuba) blog, Generación Y, Sánchez’ indelible optimism and determination comes through clearly. Sánchez, a native of Havana, moved to Switzerland in 2002, but returned to Cuba – against the advice of family and friends – in 2004. Determined to live freely, Yoani started her blog to tell her own story of her experience as an everyday Cuban facing difficulties under the longstanding Castro regime. Since then, as her book details, she has been blocked from her own blog when it was removed from public servers available in Cuba. But beyond that, officials keep her under surveillance, refuse her entrance to public gatherings, and have abducted and beaten her.Still, Yoani blogs on, and not only writes her own blog, but trains other Cubans to begin their own blogs. From her efforts, dozens of Cubans are telling their stories to the world.Why would she risk everything to do this? Why would she come back from living in comfort and freedom in Switzerland, putting herself in danger and by her own admission, giving her beloved son Teo a rockier childhood than he otherwise might have had? As I read, one main reason impressed itself on me: Yoani Sánchez loves her country and longs for its freedom more than she values her comfort. As she writes, “I have indeed committed a heinous offense: I have believed myself to be free… I refuse to accept the systematic swatting at my ‘rights as a citizen’… [T]hough I have never stolen anything from others, they want to ‘steal’ again and again, that which I believe belongs to me: an island, its dreams, its legacy.”The legacy left by the subject of Lauren Redniss’ visually stunning book Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout, Marie Curie, is almost incalculable. Marie, born in Poland, emigrated to France to pursue a career in science. The first passion that caused her to leave something else behind was her love for Pierre Curie. Their work-and-love affair achieved an importance to Marie that even overrode her deep desire to return to Poland. Pierre, Redniss writes, “saw a woman who would not fetter his scientific ambitions but rather act as collaborator, muse, and guide.”In a mix of haunting artwork, explanations of the Curies’ work, and modern-day uses and consequences of their discoveries (inkjet printers use technology that Pierre Curie invented), Redniss argues that the Curies’ devotion to their scientific careers gave them deep satisfaction. “With the constant companionship that accompanied their research, the Curies’ love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwritings intermingle in their notebooks.”The Curies discovered radium and polonium (named for Marie’s beloved Poland), and spent years observing their effects. “The Curies had demonstrated the existence of radium and polonium through their radioactivity, but fellow scientists remained skeptical. It was as if the elements had been grasped only by shadows, and so could be considered no more definitive than, say, the word of a Spiritualist medium. Chemists in particular wanted to see them, to touch them. Only concrete evidence would be persuasive.”It took the Curies four years to distill 1/10 of a gram of radium chloride from raw materials.Passion for science, and their work with radium, cost them a great deal of time, but more importantly, it began to cost them their health. Marie was too ill to travel to Stockholm to accept their first Nobel Prize. She suffered miscarriages and developed fibrous lesions. Pierre grew so ill he had to resign his post at the Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry at the Sorbonne. Redniss writes, “Radioactivity had made the Curies immortal. Now it was killing them.”Still, in the face of health concerns, Marie’s passion for scientific discovery allowed her to view her own symptoms as information, her own mortality useful in her pursuit of scientific advancement. She “chronicled her own deterioration as laboratory data,” including on her charts her temperature, color and amount of urine, and amount of pain.Marie Curie died of anemia due to radiation exposure. She, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, had won two when she died. Her professorship at the Sorbonne was the first time in 650 years of the university’s existence that a woman earned one. Her daughter Irène won a Nobel Prize with her husband. Her granddaughter Hélène became a nuclear physicist, her grandson Pierre a biophysicist. The work she did with her husband has had lasting effects on our lives. Radiation is still used to fight cancer, to give one example, and of course atomic bombs come to mind.For all of these women, a love stronger than their love for themselves caused them to consider what price this new love was worth. Thankfully, all three of these authors chose to chronicle devotion, to give us the chance to learn how to calculate and navigate those choices for ourselves. "
118,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71679987-anika-utke,5,"The vivid chemically composed, cyanotype printed illustrations perfectly set the mood and tone to tell Marie Curie’s story in Laura Redniss’s Radioactive. Beginning the narrative is a preface “with apologies to Marie Curie, who said ‘There is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life (Redniss, 6).”’ Though later the reader will discover the context of this quote is in regards to a high profile sex scandal Marie Curie was involved in, the question remains: Would Curie have wanted this? Does Redniss cross a line by going against Curie’s wishes to tell her story in a way that centers upon the crossing of Marie’s science with her personal life? I don’t have an answer, though maybe Marie Curie would have with those weird ghost seances her and Pierre involved themselves in. However, I do believe this novel is on a similar level to that of Art Spiegelman’s Maus. That story followed Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, through his survival of The Holocaust while interweaving the personal relationship of the two into a highly creative and symbolic graphic novel. And for all these elements, the story was highly effective. Perhaps more so than it would have been if it were merely written down. What better way to represent the story of the Curies than by producing it with a form of chemical science of its own: cyanotype printing? Thus, while it may offend the sensible wishes of its subject, I feel like this new lens on Curie’s life was not only poignant, but highly successful. In creating a cross referencing narrative that spans from Curie’s relationships forged out of brilliant scientific partnerships that emboldens her work, to the heartbreak and scandal she endured all while becoming the first to win two Nobel prizes for her work in radioactivity, the extent of her accomplishments are fully realized. The addition of snippets from the future that highlight the importance and ramifications her work would go on to have also add to a complex narrative of complex human beings. In my seventh grade science class, I first heard of Marie Curie. She was a poster among a wall of other posters of male scientists. I felt far removed when hearing about her, as the science didn’t mean much to me. However, this novel serves to better humanize its subjects to connect with audiences that may not otherwise have paid much attention. Despite the fact that the book is formatted in a creative new approach to Curie through stylistic illustration, I find this doesn’t mean the novel is anyway lesser. It simply offers a wider range of audience to learn about Marie Curie. For a younger audience, for those whose brains lean more artistically than scientifically, for those who are drawn in by the stories of human love and tragedy rather than humans loving beakers and green glowy things, Redniss has offered Marie Curie a new perspective and a new set of ears interested in keeping her story alive."
119,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665098-mark,5,"Wow. Just Wow. This book is like none that I have read. It is hard to describe because it is many things, but not exactly like any particular type of book. It resembles a graphic novel. It resembles an art book. It resembles a biography. It resembles a history of radioactivity.  The story is framed by a biography of Marie Curie, the narrative includes her love story with her husband husband Pierre and the lover she took as a widow, Paul Langevin. It also describes her scientific partnership with both men which led to Madam Curie winning two Nobel Prizes in Physics (The discovery of radioactivity) and Chemistry (The discovery of the elements Polonium and Radium). The discovery of radium is one of the most tenacious and persistent stories in science. Marie and Pierre took 5 tons of pitchblende ore and separated a few specs of radium chloride over a four year process of back breaking chemical separation and purification. The final steps required were primarily through multiple recrystallizations with each step slowly producing a slightly more pure product. All of these was done in an inadequate abandoned shed formally used for human dissection in the med school, using crude tools like iron kettles and heavy rods to stir the mixtures. The continuation of the scientific work ws carried out by the Curie's daughter and son and law, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. This second generation's scientific work led to another Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Discovery of synthetic radioactive elements). Like Nobel's invention of dynamite before him Frédéric Joliot-Curie wished his work to be carried only for the good of man, but his work provided the key step that lead to the creation of nuclear weaponsInterspersed in the main story are historical accounts on radioactivity such as the Hiroshima bombing, the sad fate of women who painted luminous watch dials with radium paint, atomic bomb testing, development of nuclear power, radioactivity in medicine, Three Mile Island, and the Chernobyl disaster.Every page that is not a photographer is a work of art created by the author inspired by the words on the page. She used a technique called cyanotype printing whereby she applied a solution to paper and masked it with the negative of her desired drawing. Exposure to sunlight creates the pigment Prussian Blue. A water rinse removes the solution from the masked areas. She indicates this process is relative because the final result is similar to the glowing described by Marie Curie of radium, it involves photography which was key in the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity, and Prussian Blue itself is used to treat radioactive poisoning. It is a short read, but a deep work of both art and literature."

147,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3307682-jenn-lebow,0,"This week I took Einstein, Blossom, and Ladybug in for their annual portraits. A toy store sits right next door to the portrait place. In the window sat Ladybug’s bliss: a giant plush Sesame Street Abby Cadabby doll. Abby easily stands four feet tall. Ladybug has talked about it for three days straight, and she has a birthday coming up. I love the idea of her opening a huge box on her birthday, finding Abby, and flinging her arms around Abby’s fairy wings, so I stopped to ask the price.Well. It was prohibitive, at least when weighed against our usual spending range for birthdays. Plus, there’s no telling with kiddos. Maybe she would love it for years; maybe she’d ditch it in the corner after a few days. Either way, the cost was more than I was willing to pay.In contrast, for the three authors whose books I’m reviewing this month, the costs faced could not stop wholehearted pursuit of a passion. In fact, paying the price left each of the women in a freer place than before. Anne Lamott, Yoani Sánchez, and Lauren Redniss delineate the workings of hearts entranced in their respective books Some Assembly Required, Havana Real, and Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout.Anne Lamott, whether you find her infuriating or delightful, never shies away from facing up to her own faults. By her own admission, she loves to helpfully meddle in the lives of her people, and she ruefully confesses her realization that “helpful” often sounds like “interference.” However, Anne encounters, early in this account, a love she can’t ignore or resist: love for her newborn grandson, Jax, a baby whose pull is almost magnetic in its involuntary force.In the wake of her love for Jax, Anne gives up (for the most part) something she might otherwise have justified, even to herself: her “right” to meddle with her son, and co-author, Sam and his girlfriend, Amy. Jax’s parents. Anne finds, to her astonishment, that as her love for Jax grows, so does her ability to allow Sam and Amy to parent as they will, to relate as they wish, to decide on their own future, and Jax’s, without her input. Or at least without all of it.This ability allows her to embrace a shared moment with Sam at a Hindu meditation gathering. On a later trip to India, Anne receives a conference call arranged by the leader of that gathering. The ensuing conversation, mostly shouts from the leader, punctuated by bursts of affection from Sam, Amy, and Anne, leaves her laughing, crying, and grateful.In true Lamott fashion, an irrepressible faith and sink-into-able love win out. Anne and Sam Lamott light the way for many who, as grandparents, will need to pay the cost of such an overwhelming love – the cost of keeping out of the parents’ finding their way. And Anne does this in a mostly gracious, always humorous, way when she writes, “Because I’m human, which is to say crazy in some respects, and some people who shall remain nameless tricked me into loving them too deeply and ruined my life.”Though the humor is wryer in Havana Real, Yoani Sánchez’ collection of posts from her popular (and banned in her native Cuba) blog, Generación Y, Sánchez’ indelible optimism and determination comes through clearly. Sánchez, a native of Havana, moved to Switzerland in 2002, but returned to Cuba – against the advice of family and friends – in 2004. Determined to live freely, Yoani started her blog to tell her own story of her experience as an everyday Cuban facing difficulties under the longstanding Castro regime. Since then, as her book details, she has been blocked from her own blog when it was removed from public servers available in Cuba. But beyond that, officials keep her under surveillance, refuse her entrance to public gatherings, and have abducted and beaten her.Still, Yoani blogs on, and not only writes her own blog, but trains other Cubans to begin their own blogs. From her efforts, dozens of Cubans are telling their stories to the world.Why would she risk everything to do this? Why would she come back from living in comfort and freedom in Switzerland, putting herself in danger and by her own admission, giving her beloved son Teo a rockier childhood than he otherwise might have had? As I read, one main reason impressed itself on me: Yoani Sánchez loves her country and longs for its freedom more than she values her comfort. As she writes, “I have indeed committed a heinous offense: I have believed myself to be free… I refuse to accept the systematic swatting at my ‘rights as a citizen’… [T]hough I have never stolen anything from others, they want to ‘steal’ again and again, that which I believe belongs to me: an island, its dreams, its legacy.”The legacy left by the subject of Lauren Redniss’ visually stunning book Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout, Marie Curie, is almost incalculable. Marie, born in Poland, emigrated to France to pursue a career in science. The first passion that caused her to leave something else behind was her love for Pierre Curie. Their work-and-love affair achieved an importance to Marie that even overrode her deep desire to return to Poland. Pierre, Redniss writes, “saw a woman who would not fetter his scientific ambitions but rather act as collaborator, muse, and guide.”In a mix of haunting artwork, explanations of the Curies’ work, and modern-day uses and consequences of their discoveries (inkjet printers use technology that Pierre Curie invented), Redniss argues that the Curies’ devotion to their scientific careers gave them deep satisfaction. “With the constant companionship that accompanied their research, the Curies’ love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwritings intermingle in their notebooks.”The Curies discovered radium and polonium (named for Marie’s beloved Poland), and spent years observing their effects. “The Curies had demonstrated the existence of radium and polonium through their radioactivity, but fellow scientists remained skeptical. It was as if the elements had been grasped only by shadows, and so could be considered no more definitive than, say, the word of a Spiritualist medium. Chemists in particular wanted to see them, to touch them. Only concrete evidence would be persuasive.”It took the Curies four years to distill 1/10 of a gram of radium chloride from raw materials.Passion for science, and their work with radium, cost them a great deal of time, but more importantly, it began to cost them their health. Marie was too ill to travel to Stockholm to accept their first Nobel Prize. She suffered miscarriages and developed fibrous lesions. Pierre grew so ill he had to resign his post at the Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry at the Sorbonne. Redniss writes, “Radioactivity had made the Curies immortal. Now it was killing them.”Still, in the face of health concerns, Marie’s passion for scientific discovery allowed her to view her own symptoms as information, her own mortality useful in her pursuit of scientific advancement. She “chronicled her own deterioration as laboratory data,” including on her charts her temperature, color and amount of urine, and amount of pain.Marie Curie died of anemia due to radiation exposure. She, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, had won two when she died. Her professorship at the Sorbonne was the first time in 650 years of the university’s existence that a woman earned one. Her daughter Irène won a Nobel Prize with her husband. Her granddaughter Hélène became a nuclear physicist, her grandson Pierre a biophysicist. The work she did with her husband has had lasting effects on our lives. Radiation is still used to fight cancer, to give one example, and of course atomic bombs come to mind.For all of these women, a love stronger than their love for themselves caused them to consider what price this new love was worth. Thankfully, all three of these authors chose to chronicle devotion, to give us the chance to learn how to calculate and navigate those choices for ourselves. "
148,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71679987-anika-utke,5,"The vivid chemically composed, cyanotype printed illustrations perfectly set the mood and tone to tell Marie Curie’s story in Laura Redniss’s Radioactive. Beginning the narrative is a preface “with apologies to Marie Curie, who said ‘There is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life (Redniss, 6).”’ Though later the reader will discover the context of this quote is in regards to a high profile sex scandal Marie Curie was involved in, the question remains: Would Curie have wanted this? Does Redniss cross a line by going against Curie’s wishes to tell her story in a way that centers upon the crossing of Marie’s science with her personal life? I don’t have an answer, though maybe Marie Curie would have with those weird ghost seances her and Pierre involved themselves in. However, I do believe this novel is on a similar level to that of Art Spiegelman’s Maus. That story followed Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, through his survival of The Holocaust while interweaving the personal relationship of the two into a highly creative and symbolic graphic novel. And for all these elements, the story was highly effective. Perhaps more so than it would have been if it were merely written down. What better way to represent the story of the Curies than by producing it with a form of chemical science of its own: cyanotype printing? Thus, while it may offend the sensible wishes of its subject, I feel like this new lens on Curie’s life was not only poignant, but highly successful. In creating a cross referencing narrative that spans from Curie’s relationships forged out of brilliant scientific partnerships that emboldens her work, to the heartbreak and scandal she endured all while becoming the first to win two Nobel prizes for her work in radioactivity, the extent of her accomplishments are fully realized. The addition of snippets from the future that highlight the importance and ramifications her work would go on to have also add to a complex narrative of complex human beings. In my seventh grade science class, I first heard of Marie Curie. She was a poster among a wall of other posters of male scientists. I felt far removed when hearing about her, as the science didn’t mean much to me. However, this novel serves to better humanize its subjects to connect with audiences that may not otherwise have paid much attention. Despite the fact that the book is formatted in a creative new approach to Curie through stylistic illustration, I find this doesn’t mean the novel is anyway lesser. It simply offers a wider range of audience to learn about Marie Curie. For a younger audience, for those whose brains lean more artistically than scientifically, for those who are drawn in by the stories of human love and tragedy rather than humans loving beakers and green glowy things, Redniss has offered Marie Curie a new perspective and a new set of ears interested in keeping her story alive."
149,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665098-mark,5,"Wow. Just Wow. This book is like none that I have read. It is hard to describe because it is many things, but not exactly like any particular type of book. It resembles a graphic novel. It resembles an art book. It resembles a biography. It resembles a history of radioactivity.  The story is framed by a biography of Marie Curie, the narrative includes her love story with her husband husband Pierre and the lover she took as a widow, Paul Langevin. It also describes her scientific partnership with both men which led to Madam Curie winning two Nobel Prizes in Physics (The discovery of radioactivity) and Chemistry (The discovery of the elements Polonium and Radium). The discovery of radium is one of the most tenacious and persistent stories in science. Marie and Pierre took 5 tons of pitchblende ore and separated a few specs of radium chloride over a four year process of back breaking chemical separation and purification. The final steps required were primarily through multiple recrystallizations with each step slowly producing a slightly more pure product. All of these was done in an inadequate abandoned shed formally used for human dissection in the med school, using crude tools like iron kettles and heavy rods to stir the mixtures. The continuation of the scientific work ws carried out by the Curie's daughter and son and law, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. This second generation's scientific work led to another Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Discovery of synthetic radioactive elements). Like Nobel's invention of dynamite before him Frédéric Joliot-Curie wished his work to be carried only for the good of man, but his work provided the key step that lead to the creation of nuclear weaponsInterspersed in the main story are historical accounts on radioactivity such as the Hiroshima bombing, the sad fate of women who painted luminous watch dials with radium paint, atomic bomb testing, development of nuclear power, radioactivity in medicine, Three Mile Island, and the Chernobyl disaster.Every page that is not a photographer is a work of art created by the author inspired by the words on the page. She used a technique called cyanotype printing whereby she applied a solution to paper and masked it with the negative of her desired drawing. Exposure to sunlight creates the pigment Prussian Blue. A water rinse removes the solution from the masked areas. She indicates this process is relative because the final result is similar to the glowing described by Marie Curie of radium, it involves photography which was key in the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity, and Prussian Blue itself is used to treat radioactive poisoning. It is a short read, but a deep work of both art and literature."

176,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66323993-pvoberstein,3,"Radioactive: A Tale of Love and Fallout is an unusual graphic biography by author-illustrator Lauren Redniss. It has recently been adapted into a film directed by Marjane Satrapi (of 
Persepolis
 fame), which is how it came to my attention, though I have yet to see the movie. Redniss tells the stories of Marie and Pierre Curie, two of the most important scientific minds of the early 20th century, chronicling both their personal and scientific lives.Some who understands art could give a much better description than myself, but I found Redniss’ style to be something of a cross between Pablo Picasso and Terry Gilliam. I’m admittedly ambivalent on the aesthetic aspects of it, though the cyanotype printing process that Redniss employed does beautifully fit with the themes of the work. The whole book is permeated with a certain sadness, one which comes from the reader knowing what radiation poisoning is, unlike the pioneers of radiation theory.The work itself is somewhat hard to classify, sometimes shifting between dry biographical prose and “fairy tale” poetry, interspersed with discursive discussions about everything from Hiroshima to Chernobyl, and even a few primary documents. In terms of sheer factual content it’s not particularly dense – you’d probably learn just as much reading a few Encyclopædia Britannica articles – but it’s the way that the story is told that grabs you. Redniss clearly did her research – the endnotes are filled with references to the personal papers of the Curies themselves – and has interviewed a wide spectrum of individuals with some connection to the world of radioactivity. (Though I’m going to be a pedantic nitpicker and point out that the original Godzilla was not created by hydrogen bomb fallout, as the “Radioactive Bestiary and Garden” alleges, but merely awakened from His ancient slumber by hydrogen bomb testing.)On the whole, Radioactive does a good job of providing humanizing insights into the life of Marie Curie, but struggles a little when trying to explain where she fits in to the history of scientific discovery. Much of the discursive sections seem to hold the Curies at least partially responsible for the world of nuclear weapons that followed them. While there are brief discussions of the other scientists who paved the way for the Manhattan Project, I think the framing places too much credit/blame on the Curies for the secondary consequences of their discoveries. Great if you’re searching for nuggets about the lives and the world of the Curies, but it should definitely be supplementing some other source."

However, this novel serves to better humanize its subjects to connect with audiences that may not otherwise have paid much attention. Despite the fact that the book is formatted in a creative new approach to Curie through stylistic illustration, I find this doesn’t mean the novel is anyway lesser. It simply offers a wider range of audience to learn about Marie Curie. For a younger audience, for those whose brains lean more artistically than scientifically, for those who are drawn in by the stories of human love and tragedy rather than humans loving beakers and green glowy things, Redniss has offered Marie Curie a new perspective and a new set of ears interested in keeping her story alive."

It is hard to describe because it is many things, but not exactly like any particular type of book. It resembles a graphic novel. It resembles an art book. It resembles a biography. It resembles a history of radioactivity.  The story is framed by a biography of Marie Curie, the narrative includes her love story with her husband husband Pierre and the lover she took as a widow, Paul Langevin. It also describes her scientific partnership with both men which led to Madam Curie winning two Nobel Prizes in Physics (The discovery of radioactivity) and Chemistry (The discovery of the elements Polonium and Radium). The discovery of radium is one of the most tenacious and persistent stories in science. Marie and Pierre took 5 tons of pitchblende ore and separated a few specs of radium chloride over a four year process of back breaking chemical separation and purification. The final steps required were primarily through multiple recrystallizations with each step slowly producing a slightly more pure product. All of these was done in an inadequate abandoned shed formally used for human dissection in the med school, using crude tools like iron kettles and heavy rods to stir the mixtures. The continuation of the scientific work ws carried out by the Curie's daughter and son and law, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. This second generation's scientific work led to another Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Discovery of synthetic radioactive elements). Like Nobel's invention of dynamite before him Frédéric Joliot-Curie wished his work to be carried only for the good of man, but his work provided the key step that lead to the creation of nuclear weaponsInterspersed in the main story are historical accounts on radioactivity such as the Hiroshima bombing, the sad fate of women who painted luminous watch dials with radium paint, atomic bomb testing, development of nuclear power, radioactivity in medicine, Three Mile Island, and the Chernobyl disaster.Every page that is not a photographer is a work of art created by the author inspired by the words on the page. She used a technique called cyanotype printing whereby she applied a solution to paper and masked it with the negative of her desired drawing. Exposure to sunlight creates the pigment Prussian Blue. A water rinse removes the solution from the masked areas. She indicates this process is relative because the final result is similar to the glowing described by Marie Curie of radium, it involves photography which was key in the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity, and Prussian Blue itself is used to treat radioactive poisoning. It is a short read, but a deep work of both art and literature."

206,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66323993-pvoberstein,3,"Radioactive: A Tale of Love and Fallout is an unusual graphic biography by author-illustrator Lauren Redniss. It has recently been adapted into a film directed by Marjane Satrapi (of 
Persepolis
 fame), which is how it came to my attention, though I have yet to see the movie. Redniss tells the stories of Marie and Pierre Curie, two of the most important scientific minds of the early 20th century, chronicling both their personal and scientific lives.Some who understands art could give a much better description than myself, but I found Redniss’ style to be something of a cross between Pablo Picasso and Terry Gilliam. I’m admittedly ambivalent on the aesthetic aspects of it, though the cyanotype printing process that Redniss employed does beautifully fit with the themes of the work. The whole book is permeated with a certain sadness, one which comes from the reader knowing what radiation poisoning is, unlike the pioneers of radiation theory.The work itself is somewhat hard to classify, sometimes shifting between dry biographical prose and “fairy tale” poetry, interspersed with discursive discussions about everything from Hiroshima to Chernobyl, and even a few primary documents. In terms of sheer factual content it’s not particularly dense – you’d probably learn just as much reading a few Encyclopædia Britannica articles – but it’s the way that the story is told that grabs you. Redniss clearly did her research – the endnotes are filled with references to the personal papers of the Curies themselves – and has interviewed a wide spectrum of individuals with some connection to the world of radioactivity. (Though I’m going to be a pedantic nitpicker and point out that the original Godzilla was not created by hydrogen bomb fallout, as the “Radioactive Bestiary and Garden” alleges, but merely awakened from His ancient slumber by hydrogen bomb testing.)On the whole, Radioactive does a good job of providing humanizing insights into the life of Marie Curie, but struggles a little when trying to explain where she fits in to the history of scientific discovery. Much of the discursive sections seem to hold the Curies at least partially responsible for the world of nuclear weapons that followed them. While there are brief discussions of the other scientists who paved the way for the Manhattan Project, I think the framing places too much credit/blame on the Curies for the secondary consequences of their discoveries. Great if you’re searching for nuggets about the lives and the world of the Curies, but it should definitely be supplementing some other source."
207,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3307682-jenn-lebow,0,"This week I took Einstein, Blossom, and Ladybug in for their annual portraits. A toy store sits right next door to the portrait place. In the window sat Ladybug’s bliss: a giant plush Sesame Street Abby Cadabby doll. Abby easily stands four feet tall. Ladybug has talked about it for three days straight, and she has a birthday coming up. I love the idea of her opening a huge box on her birthday, finding Abby, and flinging her arms around Abby’s fairy wings, so I stopped to ask the price.Well. It was prohibitive, at least when weighed against our usual spending range for birthdays. Plus, there’s no telling with kiddos. Maybe she would love it for years; maybe she’d ditch it in the corner after a few days. Either way, the cost was more than I was willing to pay.In contrast, for the three authors whose books I’m reviewing this month, the costs faced could not stop wholehearted pursuit of a passion. In fact, paying the price left each of the women in a freer place than before. Anne Lamott, Yoani Sánchez, and Lauren Redniss delineate the workings of hearts entranced in their respective books Some Assembly Required, Havana Real, and Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout.Anne Lamott, whether you find her infuriating or delightful, never shies away from facing up to her own faults. By her own admission, she loves to helpfully meddle in the lives of her people, and she ruefully confesses her realization that “helpful” often sounds like “interference.” However, Anne encounters, early in this account, a love she can’t ignore or resist: love for her newborn grandson, Jax, a baby whose pull is almost magnetic in its involuntary force.In the wake of her love for Jax, Anne gives up (for the most part) something she might otherwise have justified, even to herself: her “right” to meddle with her son, and co-author, Sam and his girlfriend, Amy. Jax’s parents. Anne finds, to her astonishment, that as her love for Jax grows, so does her ability to allow Sam and Amy to parent as they will, to relate as they wish, to decide on their own future, and Jax’s, without her input. Or at least without all of it.This ability allows her to embrace a shared moment with Sam at a Hindu meditation gathering. On a later trip to India, Anne receives a conference call arranged by the leader of that gathering. The ensuing conversation, mostly shouts from the leader, punctuated by bursts of affection from Sam, Amy, and Anne, leaves her laughing, crying, and grateful.In true Lamott fashion, an irrepressible faith and sink-into-able love win out. Anne and Sam Lamott light the way for many who, as grandparents, will need to pay the cost of such an overwhelming love – the cost of keeping out of the parents’ finding their way. And Anne does this in a mostly gracious, always humorous, way when she writes, “Because I’m human, which is to say crazy in some respects, and some people who shall remain nameless tricked me into loving them too deeply and ruined my life.”Though the humor is wryer in Havana Real, Yoani Sánchez’ collection of posts from her popular (and banned in her native Cuba) blog, Generación Y, Sánchez’ indelible optimism and determination comes through clearly. Sánchez, a native of Havana, moved to Switzerland in 2002, but returned to Cuba – against the advice of family and friends – in 2004. Determined to live freely, Yoani started her blog to tell her own story of her experience as an everyday Cuban facing difficulties under the longstanding Castro regime. Since then, as her book details, she has been blocked from her own blog when it was removed from public servers available in Cuba. But beyond that, officials keep her under surveillance, refuse her entrance to public gatherings, and have abducted and beaten her.Still, Yoani blogs on, and not only writes her own blog, but trains other Cubans to begin their own blogs. From her efforts, dozens of Cubans are telling their stories to the world.Why would she risk everything to do this? Why would she come back from living in comfort and freedom in Switzerland, putting herself in danger and by her own admission, giving her beloved son Teo a rockier childhood than he otherwise might have had? As I read, one main reason impressed itself on me: Yoani Sánchez loves her country and longs for its freedom more than she values her comfort. As she writes, “I have indeed committed a heinous offense: I have believed myself to be free… I refuse to accept the systematic swatting at my ‘rights as a citizen’… [T]hough I have never stolen anything from others, they want to ‘steal’ again and again, that which I believe belongs to me: an island, its dreams, its legacy.”The legacy left by the subject of Lauren Redniss’ visually stunning book Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout, Marie Curie, is almost incalculable. Marie, born in Poland, emigrated to France to pursue a career in science. The first passion that caused her to leave something else behind was her love for Pierre Curie. Their work-and-love affair achieved an importance to Marie that even overrode her deep desire to return to Poland. Pierre, Redniss writes, “saw a woman who would not fetter his scientific ambitions but rather act as collaborator, muse, and guide.”In a mix of haunting artwork, explanations of the Curies’ work, and modern-day uses and consequences of their discoveries (inkjet printers use technology that Pierre Curie invented), Redniss argues that the Curies’ devotion to their scientific careers gave them deep satisfaction. “With the constant companionship that accompanied their research, the Curies’ love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwritings intermingle in their notebooks.”The Curies discovered radium and polonium (named for Marie’s beloved Poland), and spent years observing their effects. “The Curies had demonstrated the existence of radium and polonium through their radioactivity, but fellow scientists remained skeptical. It was as if the elements had been grasped only by shadows, and so could be considered no more definitive than, say, the word of a Spiritualist medium. Chemists in particular wanted to see them, to touch them. Only concrete evidence would be persuasive.”It took the Curies four years to distill 1/10 of a gram of radium chloride from raw materials.Passion for science, and their work with radium, cost them a great deal of time, but more importantly, it began to cost them their health. Marie was too ill to travel to Stockholm to accept their first Nobel Prize. She suffered miscarriages and developed fibrous lesions. Pierre grew so ill he had to resign his post at the Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry at the Sorbonne. Redniss writes, “Radioactivity had made the Curies immortal. Now it was killing them.”Still, in the face of health concerns, Marie’s passion for scientific discovery allowed her to view her own symptoms as information, her own mortality useful in her pursuit of scientific advancement. She “chronicled her own deterioration as laboratory data,” including on her charts her temperature, color and amount of urine, and amount of pain.Marie Curie died of anemia due to radiation exposure. She, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, had won two when she died. Her professorship at the Sorbonne was the first time in 650 years of the university’s existence that a woman earned one. Her daughter Irène won a Nobel Prize with her husband. Her granddaughter Hélène became a nuclear physicist, her grandson Pierre a biophysicist. The work she did with her husband has had lasting effects on our lives. Radiation is still used to fight cancer, to give one example, and of course atomic bombs come to mind.For all of these women, a love stronger than their love for themselves caused them to consider what price this new love was worth. Thankfully, all three of these authors chose to chronicle devotion, to give us the chance to learn how to calculate and navigate those choices for ourselves. "
208,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71679987-anika-utke,5,"The vivid chemically composed, cyanotype printed illustrations perfectly set the mood and tone to tell Marie Curie’s story in Laura Redniss’s Radioactive. Beginning the narrative is a preface “with apologies to Marie Curie, who said ‘There is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life (Redniss, 6).”’ Though later the reader will discover the context of this quote is in regards to a high profile sex scandal Marie Curie was involved in, the question remains: Would Curie have wanted this? Does Redniss cross a line by going against Curie’s wishes to tell her story in a way that centers upon the crossing of Marie’s science with her personal life? I don’t have an answer, though maybe Marie Curie would have with those weird ghost seances her and Pierre involved themselves in. However, I do believe this novel is on a similar level to that of Art Spiegelman’s Maus. That story followed Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, through his survival of The Holocaust while interweaving the personal relationship of the two into a highly creative and symbolic graphic novel. And for all these elements, the story was highly effective. Perhaps more so than it would have been if it were merely written down. What better way to represent the story of the Curies than by producing it with a form of chemical science of its own: cyanotype printing? Thus, while it may offend the sensible wishes of its subject, I feel like this new lens on Curie’s life was not only poignant, but highly successful. In creating a cross referencing narrative that spans from Curie’s relationships forged out of brilliant scientific partnerships that emboldens her work, to the heartbreak and scandal she endured all while becoming the first to win two Nobel prizes for her work in radioactivity, the extent of her accomplishments are fully realized. The addition of snippets from the future that highlight the importance and ramifications her work would go on to have also add to a complex narrative of complex human beings. In my seventh grade science class, I first heard of Marie Curie. She was a poster among a wall of other posters of male scientists. I felt far removed when hearing about her, as the science didn’t mean much to me. However, this novel serves to better humanize its subjects to connect with audiences that may not otherwise have paid much attention.

Persepolis
 fame), which is how it came to my attention, though I have yet to see the movie. Redniss tells the stories of Marie and Pierre Curie, two of the most important scientific minds of the early 20th century, chronicling both their personal and scientific lives.Some who understands art could give a much better description than myself, but I found Redniss’ style to be something of a cross between Pablo Picasso and Terry Gilliam. I’m admittedly ambivalent on the aesthetic aspects of it, though the cyanotype printing process that Redniss employed does beautifully fit with the themes of the work. The whole book is permeated with a certain sadness, one which comes from the reader knowing what radiation poisoning is, unlike the pioneers of radiation theory.The work itself is somewhat hard to classify, sometimes shifting between dry biographical prose and “fairy tale” poetry, interspersed with discursive discussions about everything from Hiroshima to Chernobyl, and even a few primary documents. In terms of sheer factual content it’s not particularly dense – you’d probably learn just as much reading a few Encyclopædia Britannica articles – but it’s the way that the story is told that grabs you. Redniss clearly did her research – the endnotes are filled with references to the personal papers of the Curies themselves – and has interviewed a wide spectrum of individuals with some connection to the world of radioactivity. (Though I’m going to be a pedantic nitpicker and point out that the original Godzilla was not created by hydrogen bomb fallout, as the “Radioactive Bestiary and Garden” alleges, but merely awakened from His ancient slumber by hydrogen bomb testing.)On the whole, Radioactive does a good job of providing humanizing insights into the life of Marie Curie, but struggles a little when trying to explain where she fits in to the history of scientific discovery. Much of the discursive sections seem to hold the Curies at least partially responsible for the world of nuclear weapons that followed them. While there are brief discussions of the other scientists who paved the way for the Manhattan Project, I think the framing places too much credit/blame on the Curies for the secondary consequences of their discoveries. Great if you’re searching for nuggets about the lives and the world of the Curies, but it should definitely be supplementing some other source."
237,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3307682-jenn-lebow,0,"This week I took Einstein, Blossom, and Ladybug in for their annual portraits. A toy store sits right next door to the portrait place. In the window sat Ladybug’s bliss: a giant plush Sesame Street Abby Cadabby doll. Abby easily stands four feet tall. Ladybug has talked about it for three days straight, and she has a birthday coming up. I love the idea of her opening a huge box on her birthday, finding Abby, and flinging her arms around Abby’s fairy wings, so I stopped to ask the price.Well. It was prohibitive, at least when weighed against our usual spending range for birthdays. Plus, there’s no telling with kiddos. Maybe she would love it for years; maybe she’d ditch it in the corner after a few days. Either way, the cost was more than I was willing to pay.In contrast, for the three authors whose books I’m reviewing this month, the costs faced could not stop wholehearted pursuit of a passion. In fact, paying the price left each of the women in a freer place than before. Anne Lamott, Yoani Sánchez, and Lauren Redniss delineate the workings of hearts entranced in their respective books Some Assembly Required, Havana Real, and Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout.Anne Lamott, whether you find her infuriating or delightful, never shies away from facing up to her own faults. By her own admission, she loves to helpfully meddle in the lives of her people, and she ruefully confesses her realization that “helpful” often sounds like “interference.” However, Anne encounters, early in this account, a love she can’t ignore or resist: love for her newborn grandson, Jax, a baby whose pull is almost magnetic in its involuntary force.In the wake of her love for Jax, Anne gives up (for the most part) something she might otherwise have justified, even to herself: her “right” to meddle with her son, and co-author, Sam and his girlfriend, Amy. Jax’s parents. Anne finds, to her astonishment, that as her love for Jax grows, so does her ability to allow Sam and Amy to parent as they will, to relate as they wish, to decide on their own future, and Jax’s, without her input. Or at least without all of it.This ability allows her to embrace a shared moment with Sam at a Hindu meditation gathering. On a later trip to India, Anne receives a conference call arranged by the leader of that gathering. The ensuing conversation, mostly shouts from the leader, punctuated by bursts of affection from Sam, Amy, and Anne, leaves her laughing, crying, and grateful.In true Lamott fashion, an irrepressible faith and sink-into-able love win out. Anne and Sam Lamott light the way for many who, as grandparents, will need to pay the cost of such an overwhelming love – the cost of keeping out of the parents’ finding their way. And Anne does this in a mostly gracious, always humorous, way when she writes, “Because I’m human, which is to say crazy in some respects, and some people who shall remain nameless tricked me into loving them too deeply and ruined my life.”Though the humor is wryer in Havana Real, Yoani Sánchez’ collection of posts from her popular (and banned in her native Cuba) blog, Generación Y, Sánchez’ indelible optimism and determination comes through clearly. Sánchez, a native of Havana, moved to Switzerland in 2002, but returned to Cuba – against the advice of family and friends – in 2004. Determined to live freely, Yoani started her blog to tell her own story of her experience as an everyday Cuban facing difficulties under the longstanding Castro regime. Since then, as her book details, she has been blocked from her own blog when it was removed from public servers available in Cuba. But beyond that, officials keep her under surveillance, refuse her entrance to public gatherings, and have abducted and beaten her.Still, Yoani blogs on, and not only writes her own blog, but trains other Cubans to begin their own blogs. From her efforts, dozens of Cubans are telling their stories to the world.Why would she risk everything to do this? Why would she come back from living in comfort and freedom in Switzerland, putting herself in danger and by her own admission, giving her beloved son Teo a rockier childhood than he otherwise might have had? As I read, one main reason impressed itself on me: Yoani Sánchez loves her country and longs for its freedom more than she values her comfort. As she writes, “I have indeed committed a heinous offense: I have believed myself to be free… I refuse to accept the systematic swatting at my ‘rights as a citizen’… [T]hough I have never stolen anything from others, they want to ‘steal’ again and again, that which I believe belongs to me: an island, its dreams, its legacy.”The legacy left by the subject of Lauren Redniss’ visually stunning book Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout, Marie Curie, is almost incalculable. Marie, born in Poland, emigrated to France to pursue a career in science. The first passion that caused her to leave something else behind was her love for Pierre Curie. Their work-and-love affair achieved an importance to Marie that even overrode her deep desire to return to Poland. Pierre, Redniss writes, “saw a woman who would not fetter his scientific ambitions but rather act as collaborator, muse, and guide.”In a mix of haunting artwork, explanations of the Curies’ work, and modern-day uses and consequences of their discoveries (inkjet printers use technology that Pierre Curie invented), Redniss argues that the Curies’ devotion to their scientific careers gave them deep satisfaction. “With the constant companionship that accompanied their research, the Curies’ love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwritings intermingle in their notebooks.”The Curies discovered radium and polonium (named for Marie’s beloved Poland), and spent years observing their effects. “The Curies had demonstrated the existence of radium and polonium through their radioactivity, but fellow scientists remained skeptical. It was as if the elements had been grasped only by shadows, and so could be considered no more definitive than, say, the word of a Spiritualist medium. Chemists in particular wanted to see them, to touch them. Only concrete evidence would be persuasive.”It took the Curies four years to distill 1/10 of a gram of radium chloride from raw materials.Passion for science, and their work with radium, cost them a great deal of time, but more importantly, it began to cost them their health. Marie was too ill to travel to Stockholm to accept their first Nobel Prize. She suffered miscarriages and developed fibrous lesions. Pierre grew so ill he had to resign his post at the Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry at the Sorbonne. Redniss writes, “Radioactivity had made the Curies immortal. Now it was killing them.”Still, in the face of health concerns, Marie’s passion for scientific discovery allowed her to view her own symptoms as information, her own mortality useful in her pursuit of scientific advancement. She “chronicled her own deterioration as laboratory data,” including on her charts her temperature, color and amount of urine, and amount of pain.Marie Curie died of anemia due to radiation exposure. She, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, had won two when she died. Her professorship at the Sorbonne was the first time in 650 years of the university’s existence that a woman earned one. Her daughter Irène won a Nobel Prize with her husband. Her granddaughter Hélène became a nuclear physicist, her grandson Pierre a biophysicist. The work she did with her husband has had lasting effects on our lives. Radiation is still used to fight cancer, to give one example, and of course atomic bombs come to mind.For all of these women, a love stronger than their love for themselves caused them to consider what price this new love was worth. Thankfully, all three of these authors chose to chronicle devotion, to give us the chance to learn how to calculate and navigate those choices for ourselves. "
238,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71679987-anika-utke,5,"The vivid chemically composed, cyanotype printed illustrations perfectly set the mood and tone to tell Marie Curie’s story in Laura Redniss’s Radioactive. Beginning the narrative is a preface “with apologies to Marie Curie, who said ‘There is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life (Redniss, 6).”’ Though later the reader will discover the context of this quote is in regards to a high profile sex scandal Marie Curie was involved in, the question remains: Would Curie have wanted this? Does Redniss cross a line by going against Curie’s wishes to tell her story in a way that centers upon the crossing of Marie’s science with her personal life? I don’t have an answer, though maybe Marie Curie would have with those weird ghost seances her and Pierre involved themselves in. However, I do believe this novel is on a similar level to that of Art Spiegelman’s Maus. That story followed Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, through his survival of The Holocaust while interweaving the personal relationship of the two into a highly creative and symbolic graphic novel. And for all these elements, the story was highly effective. Perhaps more so than it would have been if it were merely written down. What better way to represent the story of the Curies than by producing it with a form of chemical science of its own: cyanotype printing? Thus, while it may offend the sensible wishes of its subject, I feel like this new lens on Curie’s life was not only poignant, but highly successful. In creating a cross referencing narrative that spans from Curie’s relationships forged out of brilliant scientific partnerships that emboldens her work, to the heartbreak and scandal she endured all while becoming the first to win two Nobel prizes for her work in radioactivity, the extent of her accomplishments are fully realized. The addition of snippets from the future that highlight the importance and ramifications her work would go on to have also add to a complex narrative of complex human beings. In my seventh grade science class, I first heard of Marie Curie. She was a poster among a wall of other posters of male scientists. I felt far removed when hearing about her, as the science didn’t mean much to me. However, this novel serves to better humanize its subjects to connect with audiences that may not otherwise have paid much attention. Despite the fact that the book is formatted in a creative new approach to Curie through stylistic illustration, I find this doesn’t mean the novel is anyway lesser. It simply offers a wider range of audience to learn about Marie Curie. For a younger audience, for those whose brains lean more artistically than scientifically, for those who are drawn in by the stories of human love and tragedy rather than humans loving beakers and green glowy things, Redniss has offered Marie Curie a new perspective and a new set of ears interested in keeping her story alive."
239,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665098-mark,5,"Wow. Just Wow. This book is like none that I have read. It is hard to describe because it is many things, but not exactly like any particular type of book. It resembles a graphic novel. It resembles an art book. It resembles a biography. It resembles a history of radioactivity.  The story is framed by a biography of Marie Curie, the narrative includes her love story with her husband husband Pierre and the lover she took as a widow, Paul Langevin. It also describes her scientific partnership with both men which led to Madam Curie winning two Nobel Prizes in Physics (The discovery of radioactivity) and Chemistry (The discovery of the elements Polonium and Radium). The discovery of radium is one of the most tenacious and persistent stories in science. Marie and Pierre took 5 tons of pitchblende ore and separated a few specs of radium chloride over a four year process of back breaking chemical separation and purification. The final steps required were primarily through multiple recrystallizations with each step slowly producing a slightly more pure product. All of these was done in an inadequate abandoned shed formally used for human dissection in the med school, using crude tools like iron kettles and heavy rods to stir the mixtures. The continuation of the scientific work ws carried out by the Curie's daughter and son and law, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. This second generation's scientific work led to another Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Discovery of synthetic radioactive elements). Like Nobel's invention of dynamite before him Frédéric Joliot-Curie wished his work to be carried only for the good of man, but his work provided the key step that lead to the creation of nuclear weaponsInterspersed in the main story are historical accounts on radioactivity such as the Hiroshima bombing, the sad fate of women who painted luminous watch dials with radium paint, atomic bomb testing, development of nuclear power, radioactivity in medicine, Three Mile Island, and the Chernobyl disaster.Every page that is not a photographer is a work of art created by the author inspired by the words on the page. She used a technique called cyanotype printing whereby she applied a solution to paper and masked it with the negative of her desired drawing. Exposure to sunlight creates the pigment Prussian Blue. A water rinse removes the solution from the masked areas. She indicates this process is relative because the final result is similar to the glowing described by Marie Curie of radium, it involves photography which was key in the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity, and Prussian Blue itself is used to treat radioactive poisoning. It is a short read, but a deep work of both art and literature."

Pierre, Redniss writes, “saw a woman who would not fetter his scientific ambitions but rather act as collaborator, muse, and guide.”In a mix of haunting artwork, explanations of the Curies’ work, and modern-day uses and consequences of their discoveries (inkjet printers use technology that Pierre Curie invented), Redniss argues that the Curies’ devotion to their scientific careers gave them deep satisfaction. “With the constant companionship that accompanied their research, the Curies’ love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwritings intermingle in their notebooks.”The Curies discovered radium and polonium (named for Marie’s beloved Poland), and spent years observing their effects. “The Curies had demonstrated the existence of radium and polonium through their radioactivity, but fellow scientists remained skeptical. It was as if the elements had been grasped only by shadows, and so could be considered no more definitive than, say, the word of a Spiritualist medium. Chemists in particular wanted to see them, to touch them. Only concrete evidence would be persuasive.”It took the Curies four years to distill 1/10 of a gram of radium chloride from raw materials.Passion for science, and their work with radium, cost them a great deal of time, but more importantly, it began to cost them their health. Marie was too ill to travel to Stockholm to accept their first Nobel Prize. She suffered miscarriages and developed fibrous lesions. Pierre grew so ill he had to resign his post at the Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry at the Sorbonne. Redniss writes, “Radioactivity had made the Curies immortal. Now it was killing them.”Still, in the face of health concerns, Marie’s passion for scientific discovery allowed her to view her own symptoms as information, her own mortality useful in her pursuit of scientific advancement. She “chronicled her own deterioration as laboratory data,” including on her charts her temperature, color and amount of urine, and amount of pain.Marie Curie died of anemia due to radiation exposure. She, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, had won two when she died. Her professorship at the Sorbonne was the first time in 650 years of the university’s existence that a woman earned one. Her daughter Irène won a Nobel Prize with her husband. Her granddaughter Hélène became a nuclear physicist, her grandson Pierre a biophysicist. The work she did with her husband has had lasting effects on our lives. Radiation is still used to fight cancer, to give one example, and of course atomic bombs come to mind.For all of these women, a love stronger than their love for themselves caused them to consider what price this new love was worth. Thankfully, all three of these authors chose to chronicle devotion, to give us the chance to learn how to calculate and navigate those choices for ourselves. "
268,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71679987-anika-utke,5,"The vivid chemically composed, cyanotype printed illustrations perfectly set the mood and tone to tell Marie Curie’s story in Laura Redniss’s Radioactive. Beginning the narrative is a preface “with apologies to Marie Curie, who said ‘There is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life (Redniss, 6).”’ Though later the reader will discover the context of this quote is in regards to a high profile sex scandal Marie Curie was involved in, the question remains: Would Curie have wanted this? Does Redniss cross a line by going against Curie’s wishes to tell her story in a way that centers upon the crossing of Marie’s science with her personal life? I don’t have an answer, though maybe Marie Curie would have with those weird ghost seances her and Pierre involved themselves in. However, I do believe this novel is on a similar level to that of Art Spiegelman’s Maus. That story followed Spiegelman’s father, Vladek, through his survival of The Holocaust while interweaving the personal relationship of the two into a highly creative and symbolic graphic novel. And for all these elements, the story was highly effective. Perhaps more so than it would have been if it were merely written down. What better way to represent the story of the Curies than by producing it with a form of chemical science of its own: cyanotype printing? Thus, while it may offend the sensible wishes of its subject, I feel like this new lens on Curie’s life was not only poignant, but highly successful. In creating a cross referencing narrative that spans from Curie’s relationships forged out of brilliant scientific partnerships that emboldens her work, to the heartbreak and scandal she endured all while becoming the first to win two Nobel prizes for her work in radioactivity, the extent of her accomplishments are fully realized. The addition of snippets from the future that highlight the importance and ramifications her work would go on to have also add to a complex narrative of complex human beings. In my seventh grade science class, I first heard of Marie Curie. She was a poster among a wall of other posters of male scientists. I felt far removed when hearing about her, as the science didn’t mean much to me. However, this novel serves to better humanize its subjects to connect with audiences that may not otherwise have paid much attention. Despite the fact that the book is formatted in a creative new approach to Curie through stylistic illustration, I find this doesn’t mean the novel is anyway lesser. It simply offers a wider range of audience to learn about Marie Curie. For a younger audience, for those whose brains lean more artistically than scientifically, for those who are drawn in by the stories of human love and tragedy rather than humans loving beakers and green glowy things, Redniss has offered Marie Curie a new perspective and a new set of ears interested in keeping her story alive."

It is hard to describe because it is many things, but not exactly like any particular type of book. It resembles a graphic novel. It resembles an art book. It resembles a biography. It resembles a history of radioactivity.  The story is framed by a biography of Marie Curie, the narrative includes her love story with her husband husband Pierre and the lover she took as a widow, Paul Langevin. It also describes her scientific partnership with both men which led to Madam Curie winning two Nobel Prizes in Physics (The discovery of radioactivity) and Chemistry (The discovery of the elements Polonium and Radium). The discovery of radium is one of the most tenacious and persistent stories in science. Marie and Pierre took 5 tons of pitchblende ore and separated a few specs of radium chloride over a four year process of back breaking chemical separation and purification. The final steps required were primarily through multiple recrystallizations with each step slowly producing a slightly more pure product. All of these was done in an inadequate abandoned shed formally used for human dissection in the med school, using crude tools like iron kettles and heavy rods to stir the mixtures. The continuation of the scientific work ws carried out by the Curie's daughter and son and law, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. This second generation's scientific work led to another Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Discovery of synthetic radioactive elements). Like Nobel's invention of dynamite before him Frédéric Joliot-Curie wished his work to be carried only for the good of man, but his work provided the key step that lead to the creation of nuclear weaponsInterspersed in the main story are historical accounts on radioactivity such as the Hiroshima bombing, the sad fate of women who painted luminous watch dials with radium paint, atomic bomb testing, development of nuclear power, radioactivity in medicine, Three Mile Island, and the Chernobyl disaster.Every page that is not a photographer is a work of art created by the author inspired by the words on the page. She used a technique called cyanotype printing whereby she applied a solution to paper and masked it with the negative of her desired drawing. Exposure to sunlight creates the pigment Prussian Blue. A water rinse removes the solution from the masked areas. She indicates this process is relative because the final result is similar to the glowing described by Marie Curie of radium, it involves photography which was key in the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity, and Prussian Blue itself is used to treat radioactive poisoning.

296,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66323993-pvoberstein,3,"Radioactive: A Tale of Love and Fallout is an unusual graphic biography by author-illustrator Lauren Redniss. It has recently been adapted into a film directed by Marjane Satrapi (of 
Persepolis
 fame), which is how it came to my attention, though I have yet to see the movie. Redniss tells the stories of Marie and Pierre Curie, two of the most important scientific minds of the early 20th century, chronicling both their personal and scientific lives.Some who understands art could give a much better description than myself, but I found Redniss’ style to be something of a cross between Pablo Picasso and Terry Gilliam. I’m admittedly ambivalent on the aesthetic aspects of it, though the cyanotype printing process that Redniss employed does beautifully fit with the themes of the work. The whole book is permeated with a certain sadness, one which comes from the reader knowing what radiation poisoning is, unlike the pioneers of radiation theory.The work itself is somewhat hard to classify, sometimes shifting between dry biographical prose and “fairy tale” poetry, interspersed with discursive discussions about everything from Hiroshima to Chernobyl, and even a few primary documents. In terms of sheer factual content it’s not particularly dense – you’d probably learn just as much reading a few Encyclopædia Britannica articles – but it’s the way that the story is told that grabs you. Redniss clearly did her research – the endnotes are filled with references to the personal papers of the Curies themselves – and has interviewed a wide spectrum of individuals with some connection to the world of radioactivity. (Though I’m going to be a pedantic nitpicker and point out that the original Godzilla was not created by hydrogen bomb fallout, as the “Radioactive Bestiary and Garden” alleges, but merely awakened from His ancient slumber by hydrogen bomb testing.)On the whole, Radioactive does a good job of providing humanizing insights into the life of Marie Curie, but struggles a little when trying to explain where she fits in to the history of scientific discovery. Much of the discursive sections seem to hold the Curies at least partially responsible for the world of nuclear weapons that followed them. While there are brief discussions of the other scientists who paved the way for the Manhattan Project, I think the framing places too much credit/blame on the Curies for the secondary consequences of their discoveries. Great if you’re searching for nuggets about the lives and the world of the Curies, but it should definitely be supplementing some other source."
297,0061351326,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3307682-jenn-lebow,0,"This week I took Einstein, Blossom, and Ladybug in for their annual portraits. A toy store sits right next door to the portrait place. In the window sat Ladybug’s bliss: a giant plush Sesame Street Abby Cadabby doll. Abby easily stands four feet tall. Ladybug has talked about it for three days straight, and she has a birthday coming up. I love the idea of her opening a huge box on her birthday, finding Abby, and flinging her arms around Abby’s fairy wings, so I stopped to ask the price.Well. It was prohibitive, at least when weighed against our usual spending range for birthdays. Plus, there’s no telling with kiddos. Maybe she would love it for years; maybe she’d ditch it in the corner after a few days. Either way, the cost was more than I was willing to pay.In contrast, for the three authors whose books I’m reviewing this month, the costs faced could not stop wholehearted pursuit of a passion. In fact, paying the price left each of the women in a freer place than before. Anne Lamott, Yoani Sánchez, and Lauren Redniss delineate the workings of hearts entranced in their respective books Some Assembly Required, Havana Real, and Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout.Anne Lamott, whether you find her infuriating or delightful, never shies away from facing up to her own faults. By her own admission, she loves to helpfully meddle in the lives of her people, and she ruefully confesses her realization that “helpful” often sounds like “interference.” However, Anne encounters, early in this account, a love she can’t ignore or resist: love for her newborn grandson, Jax, a baby whose pull is almost magnetic in its involuntary force.In the wake of her love for Jax, Anne gives up (for the most part) something she might otherwise have justified, even to herself: her “right” to meddle with her son, and co-author, Sam and his girlfriend, Amy. Jax’s parents. Anne finds, to her astonishment, that as her love for Jax grows, so does her ability to allow Sam and Amy to parent as they will, to relate as they wish, to decide on their own future, and Jax’s, without her input. Or at least without all of it.This ability allows her to embrace a shared moment with Sam at a Hindu meditation gathering. On a later trip to India, Anne receives a conference call arranged by the leader of that gathering. The ensuing conversation, mostly shouts from the leader, punctuated by bursts of affection from Sam, Amy, and Anne, leaves her laughing, crying, and grateful.In true Lamott fashion, an irrepressible faith and sink-into-able love win out. Anne and Sam Lamott light the way for many who, as grandparents, will need to pay the cost of such an overwhelming love – the cost of keeping out of the parents’ finding their way. And Anne does this in a mostly gracious, always humorous, way when she writes, “Because I’m human, which is to say crazy in some respects, and some people who shall remain nameless tricked me into loving them too deeply and ruined my life.”Though the humor is wryer in Havana Real, Yoani Sánchez’ collection of posts from her popular (and banned in her native Cuba) blog, Generación Y, Sánchez’ indelible optimism and determination comes through clearly. Sánchez, a native of Havana, moved to Switzerland in 2002, but returned to Cuba – against the advice of family and friends – in 2004. Determined to live freely, Yoani started her blog to tell her own story of her experience as an everyday Cuban facing difficulties under the longstanding Castro regime. Since then, as her book details, she has been blocked from her own blog when it was removed from public servers available in Cuba. But beyond that, officials keep her under surveillance, refuse her entrance to public gatherings, and have abducted and beaten her.Still, Yoani blogs on, and not only writes her own blog, but trains other Cubans to begin their own blogs. From her efforts, dozens of Cubans are telling their stories to the world.Why would she risk everything to do this? Why would she come back from living in comfort and freedom in Switzerland, putting herself in danger and by her own admission, giving her beloved son Teo a rockier childhood than he otherwise might have had? As I read, one main reason impressed itself on me: Yoani Sánchez loves her country and longs for its freedom more than she values her comfort. As she writes, “I have indeed committed a heinous offense: I have believed myself to be free… I refuse to accept the systematic swatting at my ‘rights as a citizen’… [T]hough I have never stolen anything from others, they want to ‘steal’ again and again, that which I believe belongs to me: an island, its dreams, its legacy.”The legacy left by the subject of Lauren Redniss’ visually stunning book Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout, Marie Curie, is almost incalculable. Marie, born in Poland, emigrated to France to pursue a career in science. The first passion that caused her to leave something else behind was her love for Pierre Curie. Their work-and-love affair achieved an importance to Marie that even overrode her deep desire to return to Poland. Pierre, Redniss writes, “saw a woman who would not fetter his scientific ambitions but rather act as collaborator, muse, and guide.”In a mix of haunting artwork, explanations of the Curies’ work, and modern-day uses and consequences of their discoveries (inkjet printers use technology that Pierre Curie invented), Redniss argues that the Curies’ devotion to their scientific careers gave them deep satisfaction. “With the constant companionship that accompanied their research, the Curies’ love deepened. They cosigned their published findings. Their handwritings intermingle in their notebooks.”The Curies discovered radium and polonium (named for Marie’s beloved Poland), and spent years observing their effects. “The Curies had demonstrated the existence of radium and polonium through their radioactivity, but fellow scientists remained skeptical.

Now it was killing them.”Still, in the face of health concerns, Marie’s passion for scientific discovery allowed her to view her own symptoms as information, her own mortality useful in her pursuit of scientific advancement.
