0,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,4,"For those of a scientific bent who enjoy getting their knowledge along with helpful photographs, tables and diagrams, this is a place worth visiting. It is organized by way of the periodic table, that classic graphic, with which most of us had to become familiar before college. There are several levels of detail in this book, so it may hook you into revisiting “elements” from time to time. You can preview the book on the Amazon site https://smile.amazon.com/Elements-Vis... Here is a sample:""Beryllium is a light metal (though three and a half times the density of lithium, it’s still significantly less dense than aluminum, element 13). Where lithium is soft, low-melting, and reactive, beryllium is strong, melts at a high temperature, and is notably resistant to corrosion. These properties, combined with its high cost and poisonous nature, account for the unique niche beryllium has carved out for itself: missile and rocket parts, where cost is no object, where strength without weight is king, and where working with toxic materials is the least of your worries. ""Beryllium has other fancy applications. It is transparent to x-rays, so it’s used in the windows of x-ray tubes, which need to be strong enough to hold a perfect vacuum, yet thin enough to let the delicate x-rays out. A few percent of it alloyed with copper (29) forms a high-strength, nonsparking alloy used for tools deployed around oil wells and flammable gases, where a spark from an iron tool could spell disaster, in great big flaming red letters. In keeping with the sport of golf’s tendency to use high-tech materials out of a desperate hope that they may help get the ball where it’s supposed to go, beryllium copper is also used in golf-club heads. Needless to say, it doesn’t help any more than the manganese bronze or titanium (22) used for the same purpose. ""Combining beauty with brawn, the mineral beryl is a crystalline form of beryllium aluminum cyclosilicate. You may be more familiar with the green and blue varieties of beryl, which are known as emerald and aquamarine."" And for the more geekish:""It is this filling order that determines the shape of the periodic table. The first two columns represent electrons filling “s” orbitals. The next ten columns are electrons filling the five “d” orbitals. The final six columns are electrons filling the three “p” orbitals. And last but not least, the fourteen rare earths are electrons filling the seven “f” orbitals. (If you’re asking yourself why helium, element 2, is not above beryllium, element 4, congratulations—you’re thinking like a chemist rather than a physicist.)""A very pleasing book both in text and graphics, rendered beautifully for the Kindle Fire."

There have been some elements added to the periodic table since I was in school, but not as many as I thought. My 9-year-old son chose this at his school book fair and we have read it from cover to cover. He enjoys quizzing me and there are SO many that I’m convinced are new! Ha! Nope. This book is informative and visually interesting. Packed with photo examples of elements in everyday objects and pieces from the author’s collection, as well as lots of important information (atomic weight, radius, density,etc) and interesting facts. Making science fun! "
2,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,5,"When I was a kid, my father had the entire Time/Life science series. For you young whippersnappers, Time/Life books were educational series that covered all kinds of topics - history, science, literature, you name it. The idea was that you sign up and they send you books, once a month, until the series was finished or you decided you no longer wanted to receive it. The Science series focused on, of course, science, with books devoted to every facet of physics, medicine, chemistry, biology.... It was a fantastic compendium of human knowledge in those pre-internet days, and I just loved it. I learned about how traveling at lightspeed squashes things by reading a story about spies chasing each other on the Lightspeed Express. I learned about how different drugs affect the mind and body. I learned about how important the wheel was, what water could do, and how the food we eat determines almost everything about our lives.My favorite volume of all of them was titled Matter, and it was about all the stuff there is. At the center of it was a pictorial representation of all the elements known to science in 1968. Everything from Hydrogen to Uranium and beyond. I could pore over those pages for hours, amazed by the idea that these things were all there was, made up everything around me. Learning that just six of them (Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Calcium and Phosphorus) made up most of, well, me was just mind-bending.I don't know where that book is now - probably in a box at my mother's house - but the effect that it had on me has lasted ever since my childhood. In fact, as I was researching this review, I found the place that sells coins stamped from elemental metals and got completely distracted by the struggle to not buy any of them. So that's how Time/Life made me into a science nerd. Nevertheless, I was thrilled when I saw this book, and had to snap it up as soon as I could. It cost a whole lot less than a 1/10 troy ounce Rhodium coinTheodore Gray is an element hunter - something I didn't even know existed when I was a kid. He has made a hobby of trying to collect samples of every element that is is possible to (legally) own, and he's even built a special table to hold them all. A periodic table, as it were, which won him the IgNobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002. He and Nick Mann went through the collection to make outstanding, high-quality photographs and compile them into a fantastic book about ""everything you can drop on your foot.""It starts, of course, with a basic rundown of what an element is - a substance made of only one type of atom - and what the Periodic Table is - an organization of the elements by their common properties. There's also a page explaining the physics behind the shape of the table, what an ""electron filling order"" is, and why the atomic emission spectrum is so important. Fortunately for us non-professionals, he does this is a way that is amusing and understandable. Gray knows that his audience isn't professional chemists or grad students - it's people like me. People who are fans of science, but who, for one reason or another, never got into the real nitty-gritty of it. All of this means that it's a book you can enjoy even if you remember nothing from high school chemistry other than ""BIFF=WANG."" [1:]The book starts, of course, at hydrogen, the element that makes the sun burn (""Even at night,"" alleges the author, but I'll believe that when I see it) and ends with Ununoctium, which will no doubt get a proper name once those crazy kids in the high-energy physics lab get around to assembling it. It includes the spectre of the modern age, Uranium, and its evil twin Plutonium. There's Carbon, without which none of us would be here, and Arsenic, which does a fine job of seeing to it that we cease to be. There's Iron, which we use in abundance, and Dysprosium, which has almost no uses that you've ever heard of. Cesium tells us what time it is, and Krypton, which used to tell us how long things were (before we figured out the speed of light.) Strontium and Calcium, Sodium and Americium, Gold, Silver, Copper and Lead - every element is in here, waiting for you.They're accompanied by wonderful photographs that illustrate the applications of each element, as well as diagrams showing its emission spectrum, crystal structure, and other information that you may or may not be interested in. Regardless of how much you know about chemistry, you should find this to be a fascinating and enjoyable book. Moreover, if you have kids and you want them to be exposed to science in a way that engages their fascination and imagination, then this is the book for you. Just be ready to raise a science nerd, and if they ask for an elemental coin for their birthday, remember - Lead isn't just for toys anymore![1:] Thanks, Mr. Hiza!"
3,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4057501-karissa,5,"I am a chemist and have always been fascinated by the Periodic Table of Elements. So, imagine my excitement when I saw this book sitting in the bookstore. Not only does it provide information on all 118 elements in the Periodic Table, it does it in a way that is interesting, accessible, and beautiful. This is a book that makes you want to touch it and turn the pages, you just can't resist. The picture of the elements are colorful and intriguing; they are all featured on a stylish black background...this is just a beautiful book.Each element features a picture of the element in its purest form. The side of the page has a small strip that gives lots of technical data. The elements position on the periodic table is showm, atomic weight, density, atomic radius, crystal structure, electron order filing, atomic emissions spectrum, and state of matter are all given in this strip. The rest of the page is given over to a few paragraphs about the element. Then there are excellent pictures showing instances where the element is used and these pictures also have small descriptions. Most elements are given a two page spread, but some of the lucky elements get 4 pages!In addition to the individual elements the beginning of the book discusses the different sections of the periodic table and how the periodic table of elements got its shape.This is more of a coffee table book than an ultimate reference to the Periodic Table of Elements. Although it does provide a lot of information on the Elements. Much of the discussion on each Element is anecdotal and somewhat humorous. This makes the book an excellent reference for the layman interested in Elements, it also makes the book an entertaining read. You would have to go elsewhere to get into the gritty details of some of these elements though....for example if you were trying to synthesize something with them or something else deeply technical.Overall I really loved this book. It is such an awesome book with such neat pictures. Everyone in the house from my computer loving husband to my three year old son has spent time looking through this book. It is just such an interesting book and it is presented in such a beautiful way. Not to mention it is even fun to read! I think everyone should have this book in their house; if nothing else it makes for interesting discussions as you see the bizarre forms of some of the elements."
4,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1517359-carol,4,"I think I might go 4.5 stars on this if that were an option. This got great reviews and was recommended for purchase by Jon M., one of our science teachers. I sat down to catalog it yesterday and ended up pretty much reading the whole thing. It has been many a year since I had to think about Chemistry, but even if I had zero background in the subject I think I still would have found the book fascinating. First of all, it's just a thing of beauty - black background pages with photos that just pop out at you (more on that later), of objects made from each element. There's also a chunk of text spelling out the most intriguing tidbits about the properties and history of the element in question, always ending with a clever segue into the next element. (While I imagine some might find that to be a little forced by the time the last element rolls around, I really enjoyed the humor, and it also served to reinforce the importance of the placement of the elements in the table; just as with the Dewey Decimal System, similar topics/elements sit side-by-side ).Speaking of humor, there were several places where I found myself laughing out loud, e.g., under the description for europium: ""With the invention of europeum-based red phosphors, color television could suddenly become bright and vibrant, thus contributing even more effectively to the rotting of children's minds the world over.""Now about that 3-D effect... If you go to the author's website (periodictable.com) you can see the photographic periodic table and click on the element of most interest to you. There, you can view a video of the object of your choice rotating in space, and/or move it around with your keyboard. But, to go one step even better, for those of you with iPads you can install an app that lets you access the book and turn the objects around using your finger! I do appreciate it when a technology is used for something it is uniquely suited to do, and this seems to be such an instance. Can't wait to try it on an iPad - Sharan?"
5,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5719641-bill-kubeck,2,"When I picked up this book in the library I skimmed the first couple of pages, looked at a random entry, and really liked what I saw. When I started reading it, I laughed out loud at the first line: ""The periodic table is the universal catalog of everything you can drop on your foot.""But then things started to slip. Gray's humor is wildly uneven and mixes on-target wit with ham-fisted jokes and gratuitous insults aimed at anything he considers silly or stupid. This kind of arbitrary prejudice and bigotry have no place in a book like this. By way of example, I will quote from the first paragraph about Yttrium (the last entry I could stand to read): ""Yttrium is something of a hippy element. First, it's named after a village is Sweden, a notably loose country. Second, it is beloved by new age practitioners .... it really ticks me off ascribe magical properties to things in the world that are magical, but in ways they completely miss.""Gray is not a scientist. A scientist would simply make his case and move on. Confronted by something he did not accept, he would say, ""Really?? Show me your data."" And Gray is not a science writer because a real science writer knows that he isn't writing for the editorial page. No, Gray is either terribly insecure and threatened by alien beliefs or he is an agent of science-turned-fundamentalist-religion. Either way, his comments are unacceptable in a book about real science, even one intended for a mass audience.This is a crushing disappointment. Where Gray is funny, he is funny. The photographs are gorgeous, the examples are compelling, and the structure of the book overall makes an excellent tour of the elements. And I really enjoyed seeing examples of Gray's fascination with the elements in the carvings and sculptures he has made over the years.Get rid of the frat boy humor and social agenda, and I'd give this five stars in a heartbeat."
6,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/774914-sheila,5,"Yes, this is a book about the Periodic Table of elements, you know that thing they made you memorize in school that bored you to tears and that you didn't enjoy at all. This book takes something that many thought was just memorization and boredom and makes it extremely interesting, amusing, fascinating, engrossing, and yes, even educational. The photos are fabulous. The information is presented in a highly engrossing format. If you have any interest at all in the elements, or are having to study the periodic table and are not enjoying it, then you need this book. It is fabulous. "
7,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,3,"i've bought this guy's beautiful poster twice (http://periodictable.com/Posters/Post... you can see it in my atlanta condo's technical bay (http://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index....). so, when i saw this sitting around at google, i picked it up and read it through. the pictures and printing are stunning, and it's one of the most perfect coffee tables i've ever seen. i deduct two stars, however, due to wasting a quarter of every recto page on highly repetitive graphics, redundant in and of themselves (if you're going to do a pigeonhole representation of electron positions, you don't also need do a pictorial s-d-p-f representation, which latter isn't even meaningful in the first place, argh). i like the spectral display for each element, but including actual wavelengths along with color would have been nice. common compounds of each element could have occupied some of this space much more effectively. there's a very heavy emphasis on metallurgy and mechanical engineering in the way-too-short writeups. most elements' nomenclature is explained, but not all. if you wanted to know that carbon* derives its named from latin carbo (coal), you'll have to look elsewhere.i was really surprised that certain basic weirdnesses of the Table (increases of atomic number corresponding to decreases in mass, the science behind state transitions, which are the least/most for any number of properties, etc.).the bibliography is unspeakably wretched, and no citations are supplied. you're buying this for the pictures, plain and simple.it turns out the author works at wolfram research, take that for whatever it's worth, if anything (if the words A New Kind of Science mean nothing to you, just ignore this).overall, a beautiful book with much less impressive text, though i dig enjoy his constant vituperation regarding incandescent light bulbs.* note that he does bother to explain that, e.g., europium is named after europe, which i'd rather hope one could figure out, or is in any case less than a question of ""carbon"" which i suppose one could think meant ""good car"" or something. either way i don't think anyone so stupid is reading about europium."
8,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/590822-heather,4,"What can I say? The Periodic Table has never seemed so cool in this gorgeously photographed coffee table book. This is not a reference work, although it does contain basic information on each element like its position in the periodic table, atomic weight, density, atomic radius, crystal structure, electron filling order, atomic emission spectrum, and state of matter (solid/liquid/gas) vs temperature. Instead .. it is a work to inspire wonder with first-rate, brilliantly-lit photographs for almost every element drawn from the author's extensive personal collection. Which is truly riveting and awesome in its scope. The photos are well-captioned and help flesh out and complement the brief text essay accompanying each element. A hybrid of trivia and facts mixed together with a liberal dash of dry wit, the text is so quippy and fascinating that for many elements I wished it wasn't so scanty and that there was just .... more.You'll definitely find yourself thinking differently about what things are made of after pondering these pages. A walk through your local home improvement store will certainly never seem the same, that's for sure. Appropriate for science fans, chemistry lovers, and chic geeks of any age. And if you can't get enough, there is a periodic table poster using the photos available separately too .. highly recommended. "
9,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64561535-ava-thompson,3,"This is a great textbook for an introduction into the magnificent world of elements. From gold to uranium, hydrogen to potassium, Theodore Gray accurately and simply explains the properties and uses of both in the past and now that humankind has discovered-- with a bit of humor sprinkled in."
10,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2598642-catelyn-may,5,"I love this book so much, it's ridiculous. As someone who spent most of high school and college trying to like science and failing (often in more than one way--I'm looking at you, Organic Chemistry!), as in adult I've come to love books that make science interesting. I've been into pop-physics lately, and occasionally the history of math, and like those, this book really makes me wonder why science education is so damn boring. Every Chem class I took felt so overwhelmingly dry and irrelevant, when in fact we are surrounded by chemicals compounds all day every day. All it takes is some cool (very very cool) photographs of the elements, and some more cool pictures of related items, and BAM! science is awesome! I flip through this book when I'm bored. It's the perfect coffee table book for nerdy people like me. If every high school kid had read this instead of staring blankly at that damn colored elements chart that look something the 1970s coughed up, we'd have more chemists and scientists in general. Or at least they'd know how pretty crystallized Bismuth is. (Really, it's very pretty.)"
11,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464095-ryan-alsaihaty,4,"Light, informative, illustrative, simple, and sometimes funny. This book is perfect to read when you have free few minutes, as each element takes no longer than 3-4 minutes to read and learn about."
12,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190297-some-small-silence,5,"I am a tutor at a nationally recognized tutoring center. One of our brightest students brought this book in to work with as an enrichment product. I will freely admit that I am generally not an enormous fan of hard science, and was a bit hesitant when I was first faced with it. I'm a history major, and I chose the topic for my Marine Biology term paper based on the fact that Sea Otters are really cute. That's why I was quite surprised when I found this book fascinating. Its blend of valuable scientific information, humor, and history makes it eminently readable. The photography is beautiful and varied, and the layout is incredibly well configured.Elements is accessible enough for my 10 year old student to enjoy it thoroughly, but deep enough that I have to fight the urge to read it in session. I will be buying a copy for myself and another for a good friend who is an astronomer at the Space Telescope Institute. I would heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to foster an interest in science, whether it be in their children or in themselves."

14,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Theodore Gray loves the elements. LOVES THEM. He reminds me of that one science teacher everyone has at some point. The science teacher that everyone loves. The one who does crazy experiments that endanger the lives of everyone in the classroom. Gray's humor, wit, and sheer enthusiasm for his subject will pull you right through this book. Things do slow down with the lanthanides, perhaps the most boring of elements (as even Gray acknowledges) but they pick back up right away. Reading this has given me a new appreciation for man's ability to find a use for just about anything, and (with the help of its many interesting photographs) has opened my eyes to the elements all around me.

21,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10792173-anton-klink,5,"An approachable, fun, engaging, visual book about chemistry? You'll have to see it to believe it, but this book fits all those criteria. What started out as a an app for iPad, has branched into paper-based book - and it looks glorious. If this is the future of book printing, I welcome it with open hands. The photos are magnificent, the text is informative and engaging, but maybe most surprising of all - this book is laugh-out-loud funny in almost every chapter, which is an amazing feat for a book about chemical elements, of all things.The middle of the book does go into a lull of sorts, with a plethora of rare earth metals, all of which look like the same boring silvery lump photographed from different angles and with the author having nothing particularly exciting to write about them. It is not really the fault of the author though that the elements happen to be so similar. Things however pick up again towards the end when we get to all sorts of unstable radioactive elements, which make for an exciting read about the history of science and chemistry. Even when we come to the end of naturally occurring elements and journey beyond into artificially produced ones with no real practical real-world applications (or even presence), the author still manages to keep things interesting.The one annoying thing about the book was the author's constant hatred for tungsten lightbulbs (discussed under at least four different elements). Time and again, the author stresses the ""lamentable"" inefficiency, antiquity, awful light quality and general uselessness of tungsten lamps. I'm guessing he is living somewhere with a warmer climate and has switched to fluorescent or LED bulbs. Good for him. But whereas the heat produced by tungsten lamps would indeed be wasted in warmer climates, it is extremely welcome in the northern hemisphere, especially during the long winter months. Neither are his suggested alternatives of LED or fluorescent light bulbs as energy saving, affordable, practical or pleasing to the eye as he suggests. Maybe in the future, but not yet.Apart from the author's crusade against incandescent light bulbs, I found the book a thrilling journey into the realm of every element known to man, and as such, highly recommended to anyone with an interest in popular science."

23,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/716890-kathleen-dixon,5,"This book apparently took me two and a half years to read. Of course, it didn't really. But I started looking at it when I first saw it in our bookshop and I read a page or two. Then I gave a copy to my father for Christmas, after which I borrowed it from him for a while, but you know what it's like when you borrow a book from a friend or relative - it sits practically untouched because you know there's no hurry to get it back to them and there are so many library books that you have to get read before they start charging you overdue fees, so I gave it back to Dad. I left it on my 'currently reading' shelf because I was absolutely determined to keep reading it, but I never got around to it until a month ago when I almost changed it from 'currently reading' to 'didn't finish'. I gave myself one last chance, however, and ordered a copy from the library. Smart move!This book is beautiful. It's also fascinating, in a way that science never was for me at school. And I do enjoy the author's sense of humour. I need say no more - it does exactly what its title says it will, and it does it in just the right way."

First of all, this large book just looks beautiful, with full size macroscopic pictures of artefacts containing the different elements. Secondly, the text is very informative, a rare thing for books that have so many illustrations like this one. Thirdly, Gray writes about his subject with a love that you would normally only expect from an ornitologist describing his favourite species of birds. And finally, Gray has a great sense of dry humour that makes this science book a hugely entertaining read.Apart from the high readablility, 'The Elements' is well planned and reserves a space on every page where the key facts about an atom are put in nice graphics: atom number, electron filling order, crystal structure, atomic weight and density, location in the periodic table and the temperature at which the element becomes solid, liquid or gas. This way you can compare different elements by simply fanning through the pages.This is a book that everybody with even a slight interest in science should own."

The images and stories in this book will change the way children view the world around them! Gray's website http://www.periodictable.com adds excellent videos and other backstories to his already wonderful work of art. A book every young scientist and science classroom in American should have. "

Theodore Gray provides a very humorous but informative description of the quirks, traits, characteristics, and uses of each element, and accompanies each description with beautiful photographs of the element itself or objects made from or containing the element in some form where possible.There's also a dose of serious science on each page in the form of the vital statistics of each element (atomic weight, density, atomic radius, crystal structure, electron filling order, atomic emission spectrum and state of matter temperature scale) and a lesson at the front of the book on how the periodic table is put together.This is a beautiful book to have on your coffee table, a wonderful book to pick up and browse through at random, and an invaluable tool for solving difficult crossword clues about obscure elements. Every home should have one!"

If you go the the website at www.periodictable.com, you can order customized posters. For example, the poster of my name has carbon (C), iodine (I), neodymium (Nd), and yttrium (y). Carbon is represented by diamond and the iodine was heated on a white plate and has a nice purple fume. It is a very cool poster. It hangs in my office at work, where most of my coworkers are scientists and engineers. Several of them looked at the poster many times before they realized it spelled my name."

He is humorous and smart, (though some jokes are for people who already know some chemistry) it is very fun and I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn about the elements and anyone looking to teach about the elements. The language is not technical so you don't have to have a large vocabulary to understand what he's saying. "

Each element is beautifully illustrated with photos of items that are made with that element. The author has a love of the subject and a good sense of humor, which makes reading this book a lot of fun. Even though the vocabulary it's a bit difficult for him, my seven year-old son really loves to read this, and it inspired him to memorize the periodic table. Highly recommended."

This book is so easy to follow and it still has so much information packed into it. If you are interested in learning about the elements, this is a great book for you to start out with. In fact, it might be the only book you need to get to learn everything you'd need to know."

41,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5485918-jacob,2,"2.5 stars rounded down to 2.I was about a quarter of the way through reading The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe when I asked myself a very basic question: What is the target audience for this book? It's an important question for basically any book, but one that is rarely asked because most books answer that question readily on their own, without any additional puzzling. But the messages The Elements was giving me were mixed. The information is much too basic for any serious academic work, yet throws around advanced terms and concepts without context as if the reader is supposed to be already intimately familiar (a ""spinthariscope"" is mentioned several times as if the reader has three already in their basement ready to dust off; mentioning things like radiation levels without establishing a baseline--you get the idea). It's set up like a reference book (each chapter starts with a picture to represent the element, its number on the periodic table, its abbreviation, atomic weight, density, radius, electron filling order, atomic emission spectrum, and a graph that shows at what temperatures the element transitions from solid to liquid to gas), yet the chapter's actual text is random--both in terms of the type of information included, and if included, where. Perhaps most maddening is how, for a ""visual exploration,"" the pictures feel just as random and unfocused as the text does. The chapters are short (typically a page to a page and a half of text, then--again typically--between five and eight photos), so the photos need to serve as an anchor for the whole book. For most of the elements we get a photo or two of the element by itself--something that looks ripped straight out of the earth, or a brick-like bullion--but most of the photos end up being that element in practical applications: medical vials, heavy machinery parts, electronic boards, bits of jewelry, pottery, etc. Like, OK. Practical context is nice, but I don't know that I really need a book full of samey-looking photos of costume jewelry and iron-colored machine tools. (That the photos--and their captions--are basically repeated from the text doesn't help this tired feeling.) And don't get me started on the later elements for which the only photos are who--or what--ever the element was named after.It was about halfway through the book that the author lets slip something about the trouble he had photographing something and I had a startling realization: All of the element photos are from his own personal elements collection. Ahhhhhh. Aha! This is not meant to be a reference book or an academic guide or even a lay-person's introduction to the elements. This is show-and-tell. Nothing more, nothing less. That it's moonlighting as something more is, frankly, a bit offensive.The final nail in The Elements's coffin is that the iffy photo choices pretty strongly drive the text of the book. The repetition I mentioned previously between the photos/captions/text makes sense when you understand that the text is spring-boarding from the photos; the things he talks about in-text are chosen not because of the element, but because of the photos he took of his collection. And while I won't doubt the author's expertise as it relates to the elements (he is a professor, after all), it's obvious that he only leaned on his existing knowledge base for the main text. There were a lot of opportunities to do research to answer things he admits in the text he doesn't know--obviously had he done so, that information gap wouldn't be there.Despite an abundance of negatives (including a bunch I didn't even get into here), The Elements did give me a bit of what I wanted. Which is to say, I came into the book knowing about the bare minimum about the periodic table (at least, among people who graduated high school and college) and I came out of the book with a much better grasp of it than I entered. For something that is by design just a glossy overview, maybe that's all that should be expected.I mean, even show-and-tell can use useful in its own way."
42,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9230812-kait-butterfield,2,"I sighed with relief when I finished. While the pictures are interesting, the text is less so. I would suggest keeping this book as a visual reference only. There are many well done photos and some interesting facts throughout but the author's sense of humor is dry and annoying. He not only mentioned that he hates incandescent lightbulbs, but went into detail about it at least 20 times! I give it two stars because of the pictures and he really knows his stuff. His failure to convey his stuff by means of a stimulating method tempted me to give it a one star rating. For example:He wrote several times that the rare earth metals are often indistinguishable but waited until the last rare earth element (on page 162!) to explain what makes them so atomically similar. Also, a more thorough explanation of the electron shells and orbitals at the beginning of the book would make more sense. Instead, he showed what the shapes of the orbitals look like. How does that help explain the chemical properties of the elements?He waited until page 209 to explain radioactivity and fission after talking about at least a dozen radioactive elements. Then he decided it would be a good idea to finally talk about isotopes in detail on page 223 and then explained how they occur naturally and artificially on page 225. At least he explained these things at some point but given the fact that this text is intended to be purusable, a reference page on each of these subjects would have made this experience more enjoyable. One last thing: He gave little histories of a lot of the elements which was interesting but failed to give dates at many points, yet another reference that would have added interest."
43,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21436520-soobie-s-scared,4,"This was brilliant!I did take one year of chemistry - and four of physics - back in high school but I can assure you I learned more by reading this luscious volume than by studying. Well, I also have to admit that I was better in chemistry than in physics but... yeah.First of all, it explains all the little numbers one can find on the periodic table. I know: I'm supposed to know them but I forgot. Still, this book manages to shed a light about them. Even better, for the first time in my life they all seem to make sense.What I love about it is that it makes elements real. They're not only abstraction but they're tangible: you can go outside and look for some mercury. I've been tutoring kids in science lately and their book was so complex: a single paragraph and four different difficult words to remember and explain without using the words described in the book, otherwise the teacher thinks you've learned it all by heart. It wasn't teaching anything about bones, our assignment: it just made it boring. A different approach, like the one Gray uses, and science would be easier and less boring.The only flaw... The language is a bit difficult. Or maybe it's the humor that's a bit weird. Of course, I did have some troubles with the over-technical words but the humor was the most difficult part. I'll read it in Italian and see what will happen. Sure enough, there a mistake in the translation when Gray talks about exchange a rock with hundreds of other rocks.In the future, I'll read the other two volumes of the trilogy. I've already own the one about molecules (in Italian) and I'll get my hands on the one about reaction as soon as I can."
44,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79814157-e-c-stever,5,"This is a great gift book for the general science geek (GSG). I spent most of one Christmas break reading about elements and their properties and uses. Very interesting stuff to think about, even if matter only makes up a lowly 5% of the universe, and is generally unimportant and fiddly compared to dark energy (a whopping 76% of the universe!!!). This is a surprisingly funny book, and I like the author's tales on gathering a sample of each element, and the subsequent visits from the Effa-Bee-Eye to discuss it. The illustrations and diagrams are wonderful as well. Who knew that the term Noble gas meant ""does not mix with the lower social strata"" of element?For the ultimate GSG in your life, I'd suggest a |nerd|sandwhich|: You could get them this book (the very small), a subscription to sky and telescope magazine (the very large), and something in between, maybe a synthesis of evolution and philosophy, I don't know, Stephen Pinker or Joseph Cambell maybe. Then you won't have to see the nerd for a few months (at least) because their heads will have exploded. It worked for me."
45,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/916446-anne,4,"This book is really pretty--it's got lots of pictures on glossy paper and it would look good on a coffee table. It's also a a surprisingly good cover-to-cover read. The text follows the periodic table in order, and neat graphic illustrations on each profile include melting and boiling points, crystal structure, shell-filling, and atomic radius, helpfully placed on the right edge of the opening for easy flip-through reference. For all the emphasis on periodicity, it would have been helpful to have included a standard periodic table, say on the inside of the cover like a chemistry textbook. There is a color-coded miniature table in the right-side graphic column, which is helpful to a point, but a full table within easy reach would be an excellent complement.I also really liked the stories of the discoveries, the uses of each element, and the useful and the dubious products associated with each. I could have done without the teaser for the next element at the end of each profile, but I can appreciate it in the overall theme of periodicity, and it's not hard to get used to."
46,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,3,"An orderly walk through the periodic table – two pages (rarely four) for each element, with a bit of text, and excellent photography (of the element in its natural elemental state where possible, often in an application). I was really enjoying this book early on at low atomic numbers, but my enthusiasm faded as we moved through page after page devoted to the seemingly endless number of transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides, many of which differ little from one another and/or have few useful applications. It seems like the element-by-element approach is not the best format, at least not if we give them all equal space. The author’s writing became a bit annoying too, particularly his choice to use a paragraph of each element’s limited text merely as a lead-in to the next element.I remain confused as to why there are so many great popular science books on physics and biology, but very few on chemistry, despite its huge importance in our everyday lives. I’d be grateful for any suggestions of good chem books from other readers."

When I first got it I quickly discovered that it's too hard to leaf through; so I decided to read one page per day - and so I did, but still, too much.But I just discovered the perfect way to read it! Grab yourself a copy of The Disappearing Spoon, a delicious fun and unique journey through the periodic table. As you read each chapter, refer to The Elements for pictures and other information; and orient yourself using the beautiful periodic table centerfold I mean poster in back. It's still overwhelming, and much more than I'll ever be able to remember, but it sure was satisfying to use it this way!"

This book takes you on a journey of exploration of the periodic table of elements. Covers every element of the table, one by one, in order of ascending atomic number. In every section the author portrays the characteristic info about the element: atomic number, atomic weight, electronic configuration, etc. On top of that, it also covers the modern uses the element has in the world's industry and commerce. All of these with an original design and pictures to illustrate the element and its applications. The book can be read by people with only a basic amount of knowledge in chemistry, although it is certainly more enjoyable by people who are in an engineering or chemistry career. 100% recommend, you'll love it!"

I had also never heard of something like element collecting (although it entirely makes sense once you think about it) so it was interesting reading a bit about the author's own collection and seeing the photos from it.Recommended for anyone wanting some easy to absorb and remember pop knowledge of the elements, including extremely rare ones you don't often hear about, even in university classes."

For one, the explanation of each element was funny, and super easy to understand, and the photos were ON POINT. I learned a lot of cool facts about well-known elements, and even learned a great deal of new elements. As an introduction to the book, Gray explained many of the phenomena regarding elements in the book, and he really had me understanding everything, even really complicated quantum incidents.

But dont get me wrong, you dont need to be a “chemistry/science nerd” as me to find pleasure in this book. Most of the information and photographs (which are absolutely incredible) are about objects and materials you will find on your day-to-day life, or about really famous people and events of human history.In my personal experience and opinion, I wouldn’t suggest that you treat this book in the usual “I sit down and read for an hour straight”. I think it is best enjoyed in “small bursts”, as it is mainly a big collection of facts and images that dont have much connection between them (even though the author always gives a short presentation of the next element, connecting at least one aspect of both elements)"

The pictures, the way its written, and again, the pictures. Each element is different, and it is amazing how far science has come just to see all of these elements, even if they only exist for a split second. This book will show you explanations of the first 100 elements, then there isn't much with the last 18, because we know so little about them. From hydrogen to Oganesson (which is kind of an odd name, but whatever). This is a great book, and remember: don't let sodium touch water, unless you want a nice explosion."

Most of the elements are described with examples of where they are currently or mainly used, their applications and origins.Despite the wide variety of examples, the descriptions don’t feel exhaustive, and a few sentences are spent for each element. Many times the author just limits the description to historical excursus.Terminology is not explained immediately when used, many terms are explained only in the later part of the book, when the reader might have already looked up somewhere else.I recommend this book if you’d like to have an overview of the chemical elements and have an idea of the importance that they have in real world applications."
54,1579128149,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,3,"Nothing bad about this little book. Just not quite my cup of tea.It’s a book that goes through each element in the periodic table and mostly explains their applications, but sometimes also how they were discovered or their unique properties. The photographs are beautiful and you’re very likely to learn something you didn’t know before. It’s just that some elements really don’t have many useful applications and those sections can be pretty dry. I appreciate chemistry but I’m definitely a bio girl at heart. If you’re more chemistry minded you might enjoy this one more than I did. "

Plus, the pictures are gorgeous. The book is a bit dated in its obsession with CFL lightbulbs. These have largely been replaced by LEDs (to my knowledge). So the book appears pretty out of date in that regard even though it is only a few years old. Other than that, an extremely enjoyable read!"
