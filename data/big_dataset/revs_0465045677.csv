0,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9517361-blaine,2,"Never mind that Buddhist philosophers have pointed out the (ultimate) nonexistence of the self for about twenty-five centuries, with hundreds of great minds in major world cultures that created vast literatures containing detailed arguments, treatises, and textual commentaries all based in a highly-refined phenomenological methodology called meditation combined with reason, logic, and argument among numerous competing schools of refined thought in India, China, Tibet, Japan, Korea, and SE Asian countries. No, Metzinger, in his Western intellectual ethnocentrism, has to make this HIS theory, and make only passing mention of Buddhist views of the doctrine of no-self. Hey, I love Western thought as much as anyone else but who in today's globalized world can continue to ignore the philosophical traditions and positions of other major world cultures? It's time Westerners wake up out of our continuing colonialist mindset and get beyond the fear- and ignorance-based dismissals of Asian thought as ""merely religion"" and take seriously their richly detailed and argued responses to the human condition. Rational-literary philosophy did not begin with the Greeks but rather with the Greeks, Indians, and the Chinese, propagating out from there into neighboring cultures who then further developed them. The philosophy of Tibet alone rivals all of the Greek tradition. Let's grant Metzinger some slack in that a theory of no-self in the context of modern cognitive science is valuable and he's brave enough to go down that road. However, it will most likely be through the embodied mind and complex systems approach that such a marriage will be realized, not in the old-fashioned, brain-bound, internalist view that Metzinger espouses. And any such marriage of cognitive science and the theory of selflessness will have to come from someone who's conversant in both embodied mind cognitive science AND Buddhist philosophy. A good place to start for an approach to this convergence is Varela, Thompson, and Rosch's The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience or the in current works of Evan Thompson such as his books Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind and Waking, Dreaming, Being - Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy. Good introductions to the central philosophy of Buddhism and the doctrine of anatman/anatta (no-self) are: 1) Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction by Jan Westerhoff, 2) C. W. Huntington's Emptiness of Emptiness: An Introduction to Early Indian MƒÅdhyamika, and 3) Jay L. Garfield's Engaging Buddhism: Why It Matters to Philosophy. Another important volume on this topic is M. Siderits, E. Thompson, D. Zahavi's Self, No Self?: Perspectives from Analytical, Phenomenological, and Indian Traditions. And for a historical look at the development of Western intellectual ethnocentrism, see Robert Solomon's Bully Culture: Enlightenment, Romanticism, and the Transcendental Pretense, 1750-1850.The increasing number of volumes on Buddhist and other Asian philosophies make scholars who ignore them or are unaware of them look ridiculously provincial and out of touch with the global pulse. What self-respecting philosopher today can ignore the philosophical traditions of other great world cultures? Wake up people: Western philosophy and thought make up no more than one third of the world philosophical pie. Fortunately there are dozens of scholars who have now been trained in both Asian and Western systems and are doing outstanding cross-cultural scholarship which is bringing great insights to Western philosophical and scientific issues. And for those of you who do know Buddhist philosophy, you know that Mahayana Buddhist philosophy not only asserts the ultimate non-existence of the self (from original Buddhism) but also the ultimate non-existence of all phenomena, otherwise known as shunyata/emptiness. Knowledge of this much broader philosophical critique makes Metzinger's focus on the no-self seem even more out of touch and lacking in a thorough understanding of what he's attempting to show. And finally, recently, a well-known writer has attempted to show ""the truth of Buddhism"" with respect to Western science and philosophy, the truth of no-self in the context of evolutionary psychology and that is Robert Wright's book Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Enlightenment. Again, it is here in the synthesis of Asian and Western thought that we will come to a truer, more comprehensive world-scientific understanding of what it means to be human. Updated Jan 20, 2014Updated Sept 4, 2017Note: This is a review of a book, not Metzinger's life, lectures, presentations, etc. I'm aware that he's more familiar with Buddhist theory and practices and refers to some of this in his various talks.

1,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This is quite simply one of the best books on consciousness I've ever read. I really want to do this book justice with a fantastic review, and I don't know if that's possible. But I'm going to do my best. Consciousness is really the last frontier of neuroscience and philosophy...holy grail might be a more apt terminology. Sure, there are lots of other unanswered questions in the sciences, but besides maybe some questions about the fundamental makeup of our universe, we at least know HOW to go about answering these questions. A comprehensive theory of consciousness has eluded us precisely because even trying to frame the question properly has proven difficult. What exactly is consciousness? Is it wakefulness? Is it awareness? Intentionality? Representation? Subjective experience? Neuroscience has been slowly chipping away at the problem. And one thing you will often hear from neuroscientists and even some philosophers has to do with finding the neural correlates of consciousness. It's been neuroscientific dogma for some time now that neuronal firing is what leads to and causes conscious experience. This is not an easy statement to disagree with. It seems obvious. Patterns of neuronal firing represent our sensory information, our memories, our emotions. Block neuronal firing in some areas of the brain and your conscious experience is changed. Mental states = brain states, and brain states = neuronal firing. And yet there is something that is being ignored here. Namely, there is nothing inherent in the description of neuronal firing, let alone any physical processes, to explain HOW and WHY neuronal firing causes subjective phenomenal experience. This is what is called the explanatory gap in philosophy. We can all imagine an organism, or even a robot, with the same functional equivalence of systems and processes without the subjective experience that goes along with it. A very complicated computer. There is nothing in the laws of physics or chemistry or biology that lead to the prediction that collections of certain types of matter will experience consciousness, no matter how complex they are. Why do I experience anything? Why is there even a me? And here is where an important point comes in. Neuroscience has also chipped away at many classical ideas of what a self is. I've always had the sneaking suspicion that the hard problems of consciousness were in some way inextricably tied to the concept of a self. Without stating this explicitly, this is exactly where Metzinger's starting point is. The Ego Tunnel is Metzinger's attempt at explaining both consciousness and the self. Why is consciousness subjective? What is the self? What exactly is it that is reading this book review right now? Metzinger doesn't beat around the bush, and straight off states that there are no such things as, and never have been, any ""selves"" in the world. And the metaphor Metzinger uses to explain how this is the Ego Tunnel.What is the Ego Tunnel? No one can be told what the Ego Tunnel is, you have to experience it for yourself. Just kidding...The ego tunnel is a selective way of representing information. What we see and hear and feel and smell and taste is only a small fraction of what exists ""out there"" in the world. Our conscious model of reality (if you don't understand that all we experience is a model of reality, this book may not be the best starting point) is a low dimensional projection of an inconceivably richer physical reality surrounding us. Our sensory organs are limited, they evolved for survival, not for depicting objective reality. And so the ongoing process of conscious experience is not so much an ""image of reality"" as a ""tunnel through it"". Whenever our brains succeed in creating this unified and dynamic portrait of reality, we become conscious. And when the organism can generate an inner image of itself as a whole, including the body, psychological states, relationships to the past and future, this internal image is what Metzinger calls the phenomenal ego. An I. A self. A Phenomenal Self Model. By placing this self model within the world, a center is created, which is experienced as a self, as a me, and is what Metzinger calls the Ego TunnelThere are six problems the Metzinger sees in developing a comprehensive theory of consciousness:1) The one world problem (or the unity of conscious experience)This has also been called the binding problem. But it is basically the problem of how so many disparate processes in the brain combine to create the unity of one world. There is no one place in the brain where all the different parts of the visual signal combine and form into a picture, there is no one place in the brain where sight and sound and smell and taste all combine to create a unified sensory experience, there is no one place where these senses combine with memory and emotion and cognition to create the unified experience of consciousness. Yet it happens. Francis Crick and Christof Koch suggested that this binding happens through the oscillation of the relevant neurons at something like 40-70hz. Metzinger runs with this theory, talking about a ""cloud"" of neuronal firing. Whatever is in the cloud is conscious information. And whatever isn't, isn't. This binding of various processes allows the world to appear to us. 2) The now problem (the appearance of a lived moment)An image of a world alone is not enough, we also experience the world consciously through time. In fact, without a sense of time, there would be no consciousness. But ironically, a complete scientific description of the physical universe would not contain the information as to ""what time is now"". So how does this happen? Metzinger basically stresses the importance of being able to flag the ""now"" as real. Being able to differentiate between memories and fantasies and ""the real world"" is a huge survival advantage. Having a concept of ""now"" also allowed us to plan future actions, and to compare internal dry runs with given features of the world. Again though, he stresses that this experienced ""now"" is not real in the sense that we normally think it is. It is itself a representation. Just think about the fact that due to the unavoidable time taken in signal processing and neuronal firing, that what you experience as ""now"" actually occurred some time in the past...3) The reality problem (why you were born as a na√Øve realist)If you solve the one world problem and the now problem, all you have is a unified picture of the world and a model of the present moment in time in the brain. But consciousness is something more. You are not aware of these representations, or even that they ARE representations, you EXPERIENCE these representations as reality. Here is where Metzinger's concept of transparency becomes vital. For any second order process that occurs at a slower rate than a first order process, that first order process will be necessarily transparent to the second order process. You watch a film and you see fluid motion in front of you. But if the film reel is moving too slowly, you become aware of the individual frames and of the illusion of motion that you have been under falls apart. Because the processes that creates the contents of your conscious experience are transparent, you are constitutionally unable to know they are representations. They appear to you as REAL as opposed to what they are, just the internal contents of brain function. 4) The ineffability problem (what we will never be able to talk about) Present a person with two very similar shades of green and they will be able to discern a difference between the two colors. But show them one of those shades of green again, and they will be unable to tell you which one it is. We can consciously represent the the difference between colors, but are unable to consciously represent the sameness of an individual color. Even the subjective experience of certainty, is itself only an appearance, just an experience, and not objective fact, because it doesn't exist neuronally. This threatens any comprehensive theory of consciousness, because if there are no concepts for certain objects in one theory, they cannot be reduced to concepts in another one, and I don't think Metzinger really answers this issue as much as talks about it for a while, unless I missed something. 5) The evolution problem (what was consciousness good for) Consciousness is not cheap from a biological perspective. And here Metzinger evokes the global workspace theory (by some psychologist who's name evades me at the moment). Dan Dennett talks about this in terms of the orienting response, or the all hands on deck theory. What these ideas all in essence say, is that there needs to a process that makes global information available to an organism to further plan motor behavior. Whatever might be relevant to a situation needs to be available for processing. When you don't know what's going to happen next, you need as much relevant information as possible to plan your next move. But what WASN'T evolutionarily beneficial or efficient would be to create another level of complexity and represent the meta nature of the information. It would be way too costly to create a system that informed an organism that a ""bear representation"" was present in the brain, when all that is needed is to know ""there is a bear in front of me"". 6) The who problem (what is the entity that has conscious experience)In the end, Metzinger tells us that what we are is in essence a simulation that the organism runs. This simulation binds disparate information together and creates a world model, flags the now to develop an ongoing experience of now in time, is unable to understand the representational nature of the world due to the transparency of the information, and has the experience of attending to whatever information is currently in the global workspace. Our conscious experience IS the content of the simulation. Nothing more nothing less. We are not our bodies, we are not our brains, we are not the contents of our wallet...we are a simulation that the brain runs to facilitate survival in the world, but due to it's nature we are constitutionally unable to know we are simulation. This is all in the first third of the book (a pretty short book mind you). Metzinger goes on to talk about lucid dreaming, out of body experiences, hallucinogenic drugs, and more. This area of the book gets more into the territory you might be familiar with if you read V.S. Ramachandran or Oliver Sacks. But while he seems to wander at times, Metzinger always ties these conversations back into his main theory of the Phenomenal Self Model. Towards the end he gets into some pretty interesting stuff about ethics and morality, as what is ethics but prescriptions about different states of consciousness? I can't recommend this book enough. I have only two caveats worth mentioning:1) This is maybe not the best intro book to consciousness studies. It helps to have some background and understanding of neuroscience or psychology or philosophy to really understand the significant nature of the problems Metzinger addresses. I think you can probably read the book and enjoy it without this knowledge, but knowing how and why these problems are so difficult gives you a finer appreciation for the task Metzinger has set for himself.2) He still hasn't REALLY explained subjective experience in my mind. But I'm too tired to explain why right now. Sufficed to say he does the best job out of anyone I've ever read. And he DOES manage to explain the self. Right or wrong he certainly doesn't sidestep the issue. "
2,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I have a psychology background, so I am deeply interested in neuroscience and AI research. I've even read Metzinger several times in the past, ranking him up there with Dennet and also a number of bleeding edge modern philosophers. :)So I had to read this DESPITE that HORRIBLE TITLE. Ego Tunnel? Seriously? I mean, sure, he explains it as the outward connection after we've formulated our internal modality of consciousness, but STILL... EGO TUNNEL?Enough bitching. And no crude jokes, please. This book is actually some pretty awesome philosophy, metaphysics, and neuroscience. He asks the big questions. Such as, what is consciousness when it's being ignored by neuroscience or being butchered by quacks? No laughter. He takes it seriously and it's well worth the effort to ask. We've all been asking it on one level or another, but everyone agrees: consciousness cannot and will not be reducible. No simple explanation will take away the quantity or the quality of anyone's experience. We all recognize our being conscious as highly subjective and reproducible. That's not an issue. But what is an issue is HOW consciousness is formed. This is important for not only AI research or our damaged selves or any number of psychological needs-based therapy... but because of the fact of knowing causes a qualitative and quantifiable dimension to the nature of what we are. And from there, we have a lot more tools in our toolbox.The book is a lot denser than I can give good treatment for a review, but let me explain some of my most exciting discoveries.We are what we say we are. And by ""say"" I mean unconscious and conscious self-references. If we lose a leg, we might have a phantom limb, but we work around it because we have included our ""body"" in our reference frame. When we drive and get good at it, we often just ""feel"" if we'll make a tight parking space because we've included the car in our reference frame. It is our new ""body"". Pick up a baseball bat or a sword and make it an extension of you. Video games. You become your avatars if you're doing it right. It is a meta-understanding of your surroundings that is infinitely adjustable. Reality itself is just a shadow, of course, in both physics and in the Platonic ideal, but our conscious and unconscious restructuring of our ""body"" field gives us better and better understanding of our surroundings. Connecting with other people with meta-narratives, models, modes, is an effort in sidestepping ""reality"" in order to fit the two models and narratives together. Hence... the tunnel. :)Cool, right? Next comes the experiments and confirmation, but so much of this feels intuitively RIGHT.We make up a meta-structure of reality inside our own heads, make our own body, and see if it conforms with everyone else's. The nature of Consciousness is just the self-awareness that springs up from having told a story and seeing whether it works with the observations or whether it needs to be thrown out.So cool. Mind you, that's just a minor feature of the whole book, but to me, it's pure gold. :) "
3,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890355-alexis,3,"""I am going to demonstrate the inferiority of your intelligence to you by spouting fantastically complex and seemingly endless sentences. They will make your short-term buffer collapse, because you cannot integrate them into a single temporal gestalt anymore.

4,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23171486-lina,2,"I approached this book thinking it would be an integration of philosophy and neuroscience. I was wrong, and disappointed. Metzinger - philosopher by profession - seems to explain consciousness as in chiefly philosophical terms, supporting his argument by cherry-picked cognitive neuroscience findings. This cherry-picking is what angered me the most, especially when combined with the moral high-ground from which the author a field of science in which he's not an expert. Approved by a philosopher, hence it must be true and valid. An untested philosophical assumption is not corroborated by neuroscience findings? No, this can't be the case - they're all wrong (see part on volition and agency, for example).Another aspect is something by which, I imagine, someone without sufficient background or interest in the field could easily by fooled. Metzinger analyses and evaluates his theory in great detail, but he only ever relates his arguments to his own idea of what he is arguing against. Take qualia, or the self. There is no little man in your head, guiding your actions, he stresses repeatedly. No, there isn't. Not a single researcher within the field has claimed that for decades. This isn't a groundbreaking revelation, nor is it busting the ""myth of the self"". It's like busting the myth of tooth fairies in a scientific book. In short, if you are looking for a book on the Science of Consciousness, there are other, more informative books (Christof Koch, Bernard Baars, Stanislas Dehaene, and more). This is not to say they ignore philosophy - they don't, they synthesise information from different sources critically. All in all, as much as I enjoyed Metzinger's writing (I genuinely did) and some of the points, the immense confirmation bias is what spoiled it for me."
5,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8930751-arkha-os-rk,3,"Having long since come to the conclusion that 'self' is is right up there with souls, gods, and angels, I saw The Ego Tunnel as the an opportunity to explore where philosophy and neuroscience were on the subject. While I would like to say that Metzinger gave me solid grounds for his point of view, I must say that I'm disappointed to some extent. I have two basic complaints with the book.One is that he is very selective in his evidence gathering. He has chosen neuroscientific reports carefully to support his thesis. He does not really come to grips with theories which would contradict him.Secondly, he often comes to somewhat tentative conclusions on the meaning of some experiments but then later uses these experiments to hold up his overall theses. I would have been more comfortable if he had been a little less cocky.There seems to be a bit of narcissism/victim complex in Dr. Metzinger. Perhaps this comes through more because he is a professional philosopher who is exploring the fringes of his subject area in a popularized text. I have Being No One in my to-read pile and hope to get more out of it "
6,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/613016-maggie,1,"science fiction writers will enjoy this book. for the rest of us, it's poppycock. i'll never get those hours back. i felt i HAD to go the distance to be sure of his intent and because the purely fictional quality of the book had me stunned wondering how far his ""what-ifs"" would go. i found out: he wants to rule the world through chemistry and clever (human) boundary stretching. even though (some) current (legitimate) brain research fueled some of his ""supportive"" details, most of his chapters were developed off of a truly imaginative world based upon a matrix of air and shadow. as can be expected from such nothingness, the work serves no one but it certainly does fit into the (soon to be demised) post-modern non/thinking process. although to be fair, some of his definitions in the first part of the book deserve careful examination, and he might seriously consider going back, examining those very thoughts, and then offering something with ... well, you know ... actual substance. but for this book, as it stands now, i must ask: where are his peer reviews? who is vetting his writing?! he shouldn't be allowed to pass this clap-trap off as legitimate scientific process without rigorous examinations by professionals. i don't even know what kind of category this non-reality based ""science"" writing falls under: is it fiction? is it science fiction? what? but legitimate non-fiction it decidedly is not.in addition, his boundary stretching ideas are not exactly new since psychedelic experiments came into their own by the 1960s and of course dupont used the slogan ""better living through chemistry"" circa 1935-1986. *sigh* nothing new under the sun but oh what fun it is seeing how stretchy imaginative boundaries can get with all permissions granted through the post-modern mind set. well, writing this book kept him off the streets. however it should be noted that beyond the absurdity of his thesis, it might be wise to pause and recall the thalidomide birth defects of the late 1950s before we jump on any part of this guy's bandwagon. watch out for that cliff, buddy.technically this book might be classified as non-fiction. but i think it deserves a science fiction category. so i opted to give it no category. it seemed the fairest way to go.~~~~~another reason i was disappointed in this work is b/c i truly was looking for an intelligent exploration of consciousness and the ego. now if he takes his early definitions and applies them (legitimately not fancifully) to consciousness studies and the ego of human nature i might actually want to read that book. but at this point, i don't trust him to present actual science. "
7,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6407188-david-peak,3,"I decided to read this because Metzinger's philosophy of consciousness is discussed at great length in Thomas Ligotti's The Conspiracy Against the Human Race, which is a book I am always trying to better understand. I'm fascinated by the concept of phenomenal selves, the problems of consciousness and perception, and I hoped that this book would support these ideas with a more rigorous, scientific understanding of the brain. For the most part, The Ego Tunnel accomplishes this task, but it does so in an accessible way that I didn't find engaging. This 200-page book is basically a dumbed-down version of the much longer Being No One, and because it's written for a general audience, it tends to gloss over complex issues and ask open-ended questions rather than delve deep and search out hard answers. Don't get me wrong, there are good ideas here, they just aren't explored in a satisfying manner. On that same note, many of later chapters felt like fluff added on to meet page count, and the packaging of the book as a whole felt very commercial, like any other mainstream publishing, pop-psychology self-help book. Overall, a frustrating experience made worthwhile by some killer ideas. I underlined quite a bit and hope to further explore Metzinger's work in the future."
8,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3398495-lynne-williamson,5,"I obstinately resist the tunnel metaphor, --insisting on a ""bubble"" metaphor. Now, after thinking about this web concept based on Google's page rank technology, I am picturing an ""Ego Web"" -- a multidimensional, highly complex, node-interdependent web -- a web slowly constructed by our brains in conjunction with our senses to form our ego. This ""web"" metaphor gets rid of the time aspect of a tunnel. Time is then an ego-web construction. After reading several books about brain structure (The Accidental Brain) and ego development (The Ego Tunnel), and one about the impetus for empathy (Inventing Human Rights), I have become fascinated by how reading, music, art give us a quick access to ways to expand our ""ego tunnels."" After reading The Ego Tunnel, I can clearly see the connection between building our own brain step-by-step via interactions with other people's ""ego tunnels"" and the huge part literature, art, music, can play in adding quickly to the stimuli we can access for building our own brain. (How many people would we have to meet before we could internalize what we get from just one Shakespeare play? Who could I randomly find out on the street to talk to who would give me the insight of, say, ""Downbound Train?"")"
9,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996-jackson-childs,3,"Metzinger is obviously very well informed about the latest research in consciousness. The most valuable part of this book is his synthesis of this research into his theory of the ‚Äúego tunnel‚Äù. He provides a plausible, step-by-step argument for how the brain generates the mind. For that alone the book is worth reading. However, the book has some major problems. It could be that some of these problems arise because of Metzinger‚Äôs intention to write a book for the general reader, and that consequently Metzinger struggled to find the right tone and the right level of detail. But the result is a flawed book. The primary flaw is the shallowness and inconsistency of the philosophical gloss he attempts to put on his theory. First, Metzinger does a poor job contextualizing his theory. The way he presents his arguments, it can seem as if the theory of the ‚Äúego tunnel‚Äù just is the standard theory of consciousness in cutting edge neuroscience. He never mentions alternative theories and he always presents other people‚Äôs research as if it directly confirms his theory. This is a serious problem because, although I‚Äôm not an expert in the field, I‚Äôm sure there are any number of alternative theories. In particular, Metzinger at best only briefly nods to the idea that consciousness is shaped by culture. What he doesn‚Äôt talk about is that what he considers the primary mystery of consciousness, its subjectivity, the self-consciousness at its heart, is arguably a quite recent development of western civilization. The book would have been improved by at least acknowledging some alternative viewpoints, and that the ‚Äúego tunnel‚Äù is his synthesis of recent research. Metzinger also struggles in characterising his theory. He writes on page 20, ""there has been considerable progress, but as far as our conscious minds are concerned, we still live in prehistoric times. Our theories about consciousness are as na√Øve as the first ideas cavemen probably had about the true nature of the stars. Scientifically, we are at the very beginning of a true science of consciousness.""(20) But the style of much of the rest of the book, particularly the end, belies this seemingly humble evaluation of the status of consciousness research. He writes confidently of the ‚Äúthree phases‚Äù of a ‚Äúconsciousness revolution, says the first phase is well under way and implies the other two are right around the corner, and he then pretends to speak quite seriously about the social and ethical dangers of this rapid progress. There is a confusion of perspectives here that is characteristic of the book. For instance, he writes""The straightforward philosophical answer to the widespread fear that philosophers or scientists will ‚Äúreduce consciousness‚Äù is that reduction is a relationship between theories, not phenomena. No serious empirical researcher and no philosopher wants to ‚Äúreduce consciousness‚Äù; at best, one theory about how the contents of conscious experience arose can be reduced to another theory."" (18)Well, that‚Äôs a relief. Except that it‚Äôs very hard to match this statement with the explicitly stated intention of the book. He frames the entire book as an argument about the non-existence of anything we would recognize as a self. That‚Äôs not reducing one theory to another. That‚Äôs eliminating something. He writes, in the opening sentences: ""In this book, I will try to convince you that there is no such thing as a self. Contrary to what most people believe, nobody has ever been or had a self. But it is not just that the modern philosophy of mind and cognitive neuroscience together are about to shatter the myth of the self. It has now become clear that we will never solve the philosophical puzzle of consciousness-that is, how it can arise in the brain, which is a purely physical object-if we don‚Äôt come to terms with this simple proposition: that to the best of our current knowledge there is no thing, no indivisible entity, that is us, neither in the brain nor in some metaphysical realm beyond this world."" (1)Even if we set aside Metzinger‚Äôs apparent desire to have it both ways with ‚Äúreduction‚Äù, this lay reader struggles to understand this philosophical project when the bulk of the book describes how the brain creates what Metzinger calls the ""phenomenal self-model (PSM)-the conscious model of the organism as a whole that is activated by the brain. The content of the PSM is the Ego. The PSM of Homo sapiens is probably one of nature‚Äôs best inventions. It is an efficient way to allow a biological organism to consciously conceive of itself (and others) as a whole. Thus it enables an organism to interact with its internal world as well as with the external environment in an intelligent and holistic manner‚Ä¶.Our evolved type of conscious self-model is unique to the human brain, in that by representing the process of representation itself, we can catch ourselves-as Antonio Damasio would call it-in the act of knowing. We mentally represent ourselves as representational systems, in phenomenological real-time. This ability turned us into thinkers of thoughts and readers of minds‚Ä¶"" (4-5). So it‚Äôs hard to see how all of this theorizing about the phenomenal self-model and the ‚Äúego tunnel‚Äù constitute evidence for the contention that there is no such thing as a self. It‚Äôs easy to imagine theorists using the very same data to argue just the opposite! ‚ÄúExperiments prove the self has a neurological basis‚Äù! In fact the only real arguments on behalf of this claim are as follows: ""It must be emphasized that although our brains create the Ego Tunnel, no one lives in this tunnel. We live with it and through it, but there is no little man running things in our head. The Ego and the Tunnel are evolved representational phenomena, a result of dynamical self-organization on many levels. Ultimately, subjective experience is a biological data format, a highly specific mode of presenting information about the world by letting it appear as if it were an Ego‚Äôs knowledge. But no such things as selves exist in the world. A biological organism, as such, is not a self. An Ego is not a self, either, but merely a form of representational content-namely the content of a transparent self-model activated in the organism‚Äôs brain."" (8)Other than the hand waving about ‚Äúbiological data formats‚Äù and the curious argument that because something is a representation it isn‚Äôt real (which would mean not just selves are unreal, but the entirety of human and animal consciousness), the only solid point I can find here is that ‚Äúthere is no little man running things in our head‚Äù. I‚Äôm sold on that, but Metzinger seems unwilling or unable to deal with the more complex implications of his own theory of phenomenal self-models. His philosophical perspective seems greatly more muddled than he wants to admit. ""But whereas the Ego is only an appearance, it would be false to say that it is an illusion; metaphors are always limited. All of this is happening on a very basic level in our brains‚Ä¶.On this fundamental level, which forms the preconditions of knowing something, truth and falsity do not yet exist, nor is there an entity that could count as the creator of an illusion. And there is no entity that could count as the subject of the illusion either. There is nobody in the system who could be mistaken or confused about anything-the homunculus does not exist. We have only the dynamical self-organization of a new coherent structure-namely, the transparent self-model in the brain-and this is what it means to be no one and an Ego Machine at the same time. In sum and on the level of phenomenology as well as on the level of neurobiology, the conscious self is neither a form of knowledge nor an illusion. It just is what it is."" (209)The conclusion is not exactly crystalline in its clarity. The self just is what it is, except that it‚Äôs not. Faced with such a seemingly obvious gap between the philosophical promises and the product of the book, one is forced to speculate about the reasons for this gap. Various anti-dualistic arguments could perhaps be interpolated by the sophisticated reader, but even if we suppose such arguments as given, I can‚Äôt make sense of Metzinger‚Äôs assertion of the non-existence of selves beyond the plain statement that there are no homunculi. But I suspect there is an even deeper confusion, at least at the level of the text, about more basic philosophical questions. He writes that the idea of an Ego Tunnel is based on the older idea of a ‚Äúreality tunnel‚Äù. ""The general idea is this: Yes, there is an outside world, and yes, there is an objective reality, but in moving through this world, we constantly apply unconscious filter mechanisms, and in doing so, we unknowingly construct our own individual world, which is our ‚Äúreality tunnel‚Äù. We are never directly in touch with reality as such, because these filters prevent us from seeing the world as it is. The filtering mechanisms are our sensory systems and our brain‚Ä¶.the construction process is largely invisible; in the end, we see only what our reality tunnel allows us to see, and most of us are completely unaware of this fact."" (9)Metzinger then critiques this perspective:""From a philosopher‚Äôs point of view, there is a lot of nonsense in this popular notion. We don‚Äôt create an individual world but only a world-model. Moreover, the whole idea of potentially being directly in touch with reality is a sort of romantic folklore; we know the world only be using representations, because (correctly) representing something is what knowing is."" (9)And yet, Metzinger repeatedly uses just such a folkloric concept of ‚Äúobjective reality‚Äù to describe the consequences of consciousness research. This ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù is used to characterize the ‚Äúego tunnel‚Äù as a whole:""The conscious brain is a biological machine-a reality engine-that purports to tell us what exists and what doesn‚Äôt. It is unsettling to discover that there are no colors out there in front of your eyes. The apricot-pink of the setting sun is not a property of the evening sky; it is a property of the internal model of the evening sky, a model created by your brain. The evening sky is colorless. The world is not inhabited by colored objects at all‚Ä¶.out there, in front of your eyes, there is just an ocean of electromagnetic radiation‚Ä¶""(20)He goes on in this way. One could perhaps try to interpret the book by saying that, setting aside the contradictory statements about reality, it is the constructed nature of consciousness which makes the self unreal. But then it would be completely unclear why anything at all, any content of consciousness whatsoever, is not also unreal. And then, one could perhaps stretch even farther and say that Metzinger attempts to wall off certain acts of consciousness:""Of course, an external world does exist, and knowledge and action do causally connect us to it-but the conscious experience of knowing, acting, and being connected is an exclusively internal affair."" (23)Maybe, and this is being generous, he has something in mind about specifically internal aspects of consciousness and their consequent non-reality. There is some support for this in the way Metzinger treats the supposed non-reality of the conscious will. That‚Äôs the best I can do. But such an interpretation would rapidly fall apart given Metzinger‚Äôs insistence on the total internality of all of consciousness. As far as conscious thought, what Gilbert Ryle might call self-talk, Metzinger offers very little beyond some broad and again, to this reader, fairly inconsistent descriptions. There‚Äôs really no work done to integrate thinking with the perhaps lower level phenomenal consciousness which Metzinger does pretty well in covering. This creates a particular problem in the discussion of conscious will, which I won‚Äôt go into. So to sum up, the philosophical side of this book is greatly muddled. I just didn‚Äôt buy it. I‚Äôm willing to believe that Metzinger has some world class philosophy at his disposal, I can‚Äôt find it in this book. Although he has some interesting thoughts about the future social consequences of consciousness research, it‚Äôs hard to take some of his bolder statements very seriously, as they come after the general failure of the book to persuade this reader of his program. "
10,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,4,"I came to this book by way of science fiction author Peter Watts, whose excellent novel 
Blindsight
 was influenced by Thomas Metzinger‚Äôs philosophy. The Ego Tunnel is the best book I‚Äôve read about consciousness since Antonio Damasio‚Äôs 
Self Comes to Mind
. Damasio and Metzinger have much in common, but I ultimately prefer Metzinger‚Äôs approach; as a neuroscientist, Damasio focuses mostly on the technical issues of how consciousness is constructed, whereas Metzinger‚Äôs philosophical background prompts him to explicitly to link our current knowledge about consciousness to relevant social, political, and ethical concerns. The Ego Tunnel explores a bevy of neuroscientific evidence‚Äì‚Äìincluding but not limited to information about out-of-body experiences, lucid dreams, meditation, brain disorders, and artificial intelligence‚Äì‚Äìto probe our deepest questions about what consciousness is, how it occurs, and how our understanding of it might reshape human experience and culture.Metzinger‚Äôs pet metaphor for describing consciousness is an extremely effective tool for readers seeking to build abstract models of their own thinking processes. The Ego Tunnel creates for us the appearance of a world, ‚Äúa low-dimensional projection of the inconceivably richer physical reality surrounding and sustaining us‚Ä¶The ongoing process of conscious experience is not so much an image of reality as a tunnel through reality‚Äù (6, emphasis his). Thinking of one‚Äôs conscious experience as lived through a tunnel has a lot of advantages if we are trying to understand and expose (insofar as is possible) the representative models our brains construct in order to present the world to us and help us interact with it. Tunnels have walls on all sides and are typically traversed in a linear fashion. These features map onto human experience, a phenomenon which is comprehensively mediated and enabled by self-generated representations that carry us inexorably forward in time. The commonplace notion of the ‚Äúend of the tunnel‚Äù is also the termination of this metaphor‚Äôs usefulness: We never ‚Äúget out‚Äù of the Ego Tunnel, because we are the Ego Tunnel. (Arguably, death involves leaving the tunnel, but since there is no good reason to believe experience is possible after death, there is little hope of discovering what it would be like to escape the tunnel with our identity and/or sensory faculties intact.)While the tunnel metaphor effectively illustrates the forward momentum of consciousness through time, it fails to adequately capture another essential element of that journey, which is how brains construct the illusion of a consistent personal identity. This feature, which Damasio calls the ‚Äúautobiographical self,‚Äù is responsible for tracking the narrative of one‚Äôs life and weaving stories‚Äì‚Äìsome true, some false‚Äì‚Äìabout who we are, who we‚Äôve been, and who we might be in the future. Metzinger has many interesting things to say about consciousness, but is surprisingly taciturn when it comes to this critical component of our lived experience. He prefers to focus on consciousness as it occurs in particular, discreet moments, rather than how it creates a self-reflective narrative over the course of a lifetime. He prefers to focus on consciousness as it occurs in particular, discreet moments, rather than how it creates a self-reflective narrative over the course of a lifetime.This oversight is likely a contributing factor to Metzinger‚Äôs tenuous assertion that humans do not actually possess ‚Äúselves.‚Äù This is not a novel idea, especially for a philosopher, and the pages spent on this topic are actually among the dullest in this otherwise concise and fascinating book. Metzinger suggests we should redefine the self as a ‚Äúprocess‚Äù rather than a static entity (also not a novel philosophical idea): ‚ÄúAs long as the life process‚Äì‚Äìthe ongoing process of self-stabilization and self-sustainment‚Äì‚Äìis reflected in a conscious Ego Tunnel, we are indeed selves. Or rather, we are ‚Äòselfing‚Äô organisms‚Äù (208). I take this to mean that, like myriad thinkers who came before him, Metzinger is simply refuting the idea of the immutable soul, or of the self as a fixed and/or immaterial locus of identity. Contrary to his claim, Metzinger has not proved that humans don‚Äôt possess selfhood, but rather that selfhood arises in a much different way than Western thinkers have traditionally posited (and let‚Äôs not forget that Eastern thinkers had this figured out millennia ago!). Even if we buy Metzinger‚Äôs arguments wholesale, it still seems both accurate and expedient to say people have selfhood. The difference is that we now understand selfhood as a phenomenological consequence of how our material bodies are structured‚Äì‚Äìa semantic and conceptual shift rather than an empirical one.Even if Metzinger fails to disprove the existence of selves, this book is worth reading solely for the artistry with which he describes the Ego Tunnel. Although he sometimes repeats himself unnecessarily, Metzinger has a tremendous talent for using language to break down mechanisms of consciousness, employing effective examples along the way (many of which include prompting the reader to think about how his or her brain is actively simulating the experience of interacting with the text). Reading the first few chapters of this book was about as close as I‚Äôve ever come to a text-induced hallucination; I remember looking up from the page once or twice and surveying my kitchen, delightfully skeptical about the veracity of everything I was seeing. There were also times I began to see ghostly tunnel walls appear in my peripheral vision‚Äì‚Äìan experience I‚Äôve had in the past, but not while reading. Here‚Äôs an example of what I‚Äôm talking about:""The conscious brain is a biological machine‚Äì‚Äìa reality engine‚Äì‚Äìthat purports to tell us what exists and what doesn‚Äôt. It is unsettling to discover that there are no colors out there in front of your eyes. The apricot-pink of the setting sun is not a property of the evening sky; it is a property of the internal model of the evening sky, a model created by your brain. The evening sky is colorless. The world is not inhabited by colored objects at all. It is just as your physics teacher in high school told you: Out there, in front of your eyes, there is just an ocean of electromagnetic radiation, a wild and raging mixture of different wavelengths. Most of them are invisible to you and can never become part of your conscious model of reality. What is really happening is that the visual system in your brain is drilling a tunnel through this inconceivably rich physical environment and in the process is painting the tunnel walls in various shades of color. Phenomenal color. Appearance. For your conscious eyes only."" (20, emphasis his)As Metzinger acknowledges, he isn‚Äôt describing anything outside the valence of a high school physics class; nevertheless, a chill went through me when I read, ‚ÄúThe evening sky is colorless.‚Äù I know this is true, but I don‚Äôt think about it very often, mostly because it‚Äôs not a pragmatically useful piece of information. Still, I don‚Äôt want to underestimate the potential of such statements, pedestrian as they may be for educated readers, to generate moments of clarity and creativity that are hard to come by from inside the maze of our quotidian habits. The Ego Tunnel rarely shows its borders or hints at anything external to itself, so taking a moment to dissolve into those peripheral parts of our lived experience is both fun and enlightening.The fact that the experience of reading this book was so enjoyable (as opposed to a simple assessment of how informative it was) bespeaks Metzinger‚Äôs preoccupation with the phenomenology of consciousness. While there are conflicting views about the importance of phenomenology when it comes to constructing a theory of consciousness, for now I am firmly in the camp of Metzinger and others who believe that our experience of ourselves‚Äì‚Äìregardless of how much it may sometimes diverge from scientific observations‚Äì‚Äìis a hugely important part of the consciousness puzzle. That is because phenomenology is quite literally where we live. Even the best neuroscientists don‚Äôt escape their own Ego Tunnels: they interact with carefully cultivated and highly accurate representations of reality, not with reality itself. Moreover, experience is paramount when trying to use empirical findings to improve human societies, because it doesn‚Äôt much matter if we improve things by some quantitative or ‚Äúobjective‚Äù standard if people‚Äôs actual experience of being alive isn‚Äôt positively affected.The main reason we should take seriously the phenomenological component of the consciousness question has to do with what Metzinger calls ‚Äútransparency‚Äù:""Transparency simply means that we are unaware of the medium through which information reaches us‚Ä¶We do not see neurons firing away in our brain but only what they represent for us. A conscious world-model active in the brain is transparent if the brain has no chance of discovering that it is a model‚Äì‚Äìwe look right through it, directly onto the world, as it were."" (7)This is another idea I‚Äôve come across many times, but Metzinger‚Äôs language helped me internalize it in what felt like a brand new way. I think I originally became fascinated with neuroscience because it helped lift the veil somewhat on the transparent workings of my own mind and the minds of others. Because our brains present us with a hyper-realistic illusion of direct contact with the world, it is incredible to me that we‚Äôve been able to draw up at least a basic blueprint of the virtually invisible mental mechanisms that generate this phenomenon. Additionally, the persistence of these transparent mechanisms ensures that, at least for now, we have to take seriously the ways in which our experience of being ourselves diverges from, conflicts with, or conforms to our findings about how the mind actually works. Knowledge of the Ego Tunnel doesn‚Äôt emancipate us from it, so we are faced with the dual project of getting to know the inconceivably intricate insides of the Tunnel while also striving to create good representations of the world as it exists beyond its impenetrable walls.Confronted with the inescapable nature of the Ego Tunnel, some philosophers would descend into either solipsism or pessimism. Happily, Metzinger avoids both of these pitfalls. He doesn‚Äôt for a moment deny the existence of an objective, external world shared by all humans, and also doesn‚Äôt see the Ego Tunnel as a prison that precludes meaningful interaction and empathic understanding. Instead, he suggests that we ought to embrace a new era of consciously constructed experience, using any and all means available (collectively called ‚Äúphenotechnology‚Äù) to ‚Äúactively design the structure of our conscious minds‚Äù (218). This idea is a terrific complement to recent arguments in favor of ‚Äúconscious evolution,‚Äù most thoroughly advocated for by Ted Chu in his book 
Human Purpose and Transhuman Potential
. Metzinger thinks the best way to promote individual autonomy and improve the quality of human life is for us to engage in whatever combinations of physical, chemical, and spiritual behavior we can possibly think of, boldly seeking out efficacious states of consciousness while also discovering (and perhaps limiting human access to) destructive ones.In order to make this kind of ‚Äúexperiential play‚Äù available worldwide, we will have to undertake seismic shifts in humanity‚Äôs values as well as our social, economic and political practices. Unlike some thinkers who downplay the consequences of naturalism for archaic value systems and social organizations, Metzinger concedes that naturalism has created an ‚Äúethical vacuum‚Äù that we must work hard to fill: ‚ÄúScientists and academic philosophers cannot simply confine themselves to making contributions to a comprehensive theory of consciousness and the self. If moral obligation exists, they must also confront the anthropological and normative void they have created‚Äù (215). Metzinger strikes perfectly the chord that so many scientists and researchers fail to hear: discoveries about the workings of nature and the human mind invariably come with normative strings attached. We cannot divorce scientific inquiry from its ethical consequences, though we can and should work collaboratively to reduce bias and overreach.Metzinger does not turn away from the fact that this process will be fraught and messy. He calls for the rise of ‚Äúconsciousness culture,‚Äù imploring individuals from all backgrounds to embark on quests to discover states of consciousness that provide our lives with meaning, happiness, and intersubjective richness: ‚ÄúUnless the interests of others are directly threatened, people ought to be free to explore their own minds and design their own conscious reality-models according to their wishes, needs, and beliefs‚Äù (238). There are many practical things we can do to help this process along, including the forumlation of sane drug policies, the introduction of ‚Äúattention management‚Äù skills in public education, and redefining human labor in a way that is sensitive to the quality of conscious experience (good and bad) produced in workplaces. While Metzinger does a better job of problematizing these situations than of offering solutions, that is the proper role for a book of this sort. Metzinger cannot be responsible for generating solutions that ought to result from humanity‚Äôs collective debates, experiments, and missteps.It‚Äôs worth noting that none of this will come to pass if we destroy Earth‚Äôs capacity to support human life, allow our civilizations to crumble under the weight of widespread poverty, or fall prey to ‚Äúirrationalism and fundamentalism‚Äù (238). Metzinger has done a fine job of outlining where we should venture if all goes well in the coming decades and centuries, but his ideas do little to address more immediate problems like climate change, socioeconomic inequality, starvation, and political gridlock. He can hardly be faulted for this as solving these issues is not the focus of his research, but we should keep in mind that humanity‚Äôs accomplishments and potential for positive growth are highly contingent and fragile. For me, it goes without saying that if Metzinger‚Äôs ‚ÄúConsciousness Revolution‚Äù is achievable, it would markedly improve the quality of human life and help communities become more adaptable, vibrant, and resistant to collapse.This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."
11,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12153213-kaj-sotala,4,"Nice discussion of Metzinger's theory of consciousness. His basic claim is that what humans tend to think of as a ""self"" is what he calls a ""phenomenal self-model"" (PSM). As the name suggests, the PSM is the brain's model of the organism as a whole, and includes things such as a model of the organism's body. The PSM is situated within a broader world-model of the environment that the organism exists in. Metzinger claims that the reason why we experience there being thing such as ""selves"" is that there has been no evolutionary advantage in seeing the PSM as a model - we do not see the sophisticated computational machinery which produces it, and thus experience it as something self-contained and essential, rather as something that's constructed from parts for the sake of enabling better information-processing.Metzinger's book discusses a number of experiments as well as details of what our conscious experience is like and what the reasons for that might be.For example, humans perceive time as a kind of eternal present: everything we experience is experienced as happening ""now"", and even when we recall a memory of the past or think of the future, it is experienced as us remembering or planning something right now. But one could imagine a mind that didn't have any conception of an immediate privileged now. Metzinger doesn't go into detail of how this kind of a different mind would represent time, but personally I could speculate it as having just mental representations of events with different timestamps, with increasingly broad probability distributions on those events that had not yet been witnessed but which were extrapolated to happen, or of which sufficient time had passed that the memories might be becoming uncertain...Metzinger suggests that the experience of a unified now emerges from the need to take quick action in response to threatening situations in the environment, and to provide all of the subsystems in the brain with a shared temporal frame of reference:Although, strictly speaking, no such thing as Now exists in the outside world, it proved adaptive to organize the inner model of the world around such a Now - creating a common temporal frame of reference for all the mechanisms in the brain so that they can access the same information at the same time. A certain point in time had to be represented in a privileged manner in order to be flagged as reality.Metzinger also suggests that this sense of a Now is part of what enables consciousness as we understand it: experiencing ourselves as being embedded in a constantly-developing Now is a fundamental part of human experience and consciousness.The weakest part of the book is the last third, where the topic suddenly switches into that of ethics. The discussion in this section seems quite disconnected from that of the previous sections, and Metzinger starts talking about issues such as national drug policies and whether meditation should be taught in schools. A part of this discussion is justifiable as it touches upon the question of the effects that an increased understanding of consciousness research will have on society, but the whole discussion mostly comes off as superficial and not very well-argued. (Though I will admit that I started skimming this section pretty quickly.)Nonetheless, overall Metzinger paints a very interesting picture of his theory of how the brain might work, though there's still a definite speculative vibe around it all."

13,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936557-paul,2,"This book is good for a few reasons. I appreciated the breakdown of the consciousness problem. It was also interesting to take a dive into the aspects of phantom limbs, out of body experiences, and lucid dreaming. The bad outweighed the good for me however. For a book that does very little to tie what's said to scientific results, and mostly seems to be the synthesis of the authors opinion, I found it difficult to absorb.Other aspects that I did not appreciate are harder to pinpoint, but at times it seemed I would read something shocking because a statement would be made out of the blue as an assumption that I had no idea on how it had been arrived at. Or maybe I just don't agree with some of this synthesis of opinion. At one point the author states that religion is what has provided humanity with a moral foundation, and because of that we need something to replace it as science uncovers the true nature of reality for us. Ummm, no, not really. I'm pretty sure our morals are innate, but maybe I misunderstood the meaning.Consciousness is obviously a difficult subject, and unfortunately it's easy for writing about it to devolve into using words too fuzzy to have enough meaning to be saying anything important. One section ends in such a way with this quote: In sum and on the level of phenomenology as well as on the level of neurobiology, the conscious self is neither a form of knowledge nor an illusion. It just is what it isIt just is what it is. Well, thanks for that. I don't regret reading The Ego Tunnel, it certainly has some content to be appreciated. It just should have been a more focused in my opinion."

Unfortunately the author managed to piss me off already in the introduction by the rude way he brushed off those older guys who invented the term ‚Äûreality tunnel‚Äú (‚Äûlots of nonsense‚Äú). I consider this attitude to be kind of fishy.That was when I decided to learn more about the author‚Äôs personal ego tunnel and googled him, to find (I am German) that in all seriousness he proposed a license for the use of LSD, like a driver‚Äôs license, including health check and a test. This just does not bear thinking about. Thus, having lost not only my faith in the author‚Äôs integrity but also my trust in his mental abilities, I find reading this book is uphill work.

I am a Psychology student and much of the research in this work relates specifically to this particular science. There is, however, a lot of neuropsychology that I didn't understand.

That isn't to say that some day it won't be possible for me to properly understand the ideas presented in this book that exceeded my abilities this time. I do believe this is a highly worth it read for anyone, even neophytes in the domain, just for a broadening of intellectual and cultural borders. As with any science book in general. "
16,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"For those seeking some coherent philosophy coming from continental Europe, Thomas Metzinger is your man. A couple of his books are on my reading list. I haven‚Äôt yet read ‚ÄúBeing No One: The Self-Model Theory of Subjectivity,‚Äù but I hear it‚Äôs good. The one I‚Äôve just finished is ‚ÄúThe Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self,‚Äù and it is on a similar subject. So here‚Äôs a brief review.The big claim of the book is that there is no such thing as a self. Contrary to what most people believe, nobody has ever been or had a self. Metzinger offers, ‚Äúit is not just that the modern philosophy of mind and cognitive neuroscience together are about to shatter the myth of the self. It has now become clear that we will never solve the philosophical puzzle of consciousness‚Äîthat is, how it can arise in the brain, which is a purely physical object‚Äîif we don‚Äôt come to terms with this simple proposition: that to the best of our current knowledge there is no thing, no indivisible entity, that is us, neither in the brain nor in some metaphysical realm beyond this world.‚ÄùOK, the illusion of self is not exactly a XXI century revelation. Some humans (early Buddhists) kind of got it back in the sixth century B.C. What is different now is that this claim is supported by modern neuroscience. Throughout the book, Metzinger uses one central metaphor for conscious experience: the ‚ÄúEgo Tunnel.‚Äù Conscious experience is like a tunnel. Modern neuroscience has demonstrated that the content of our conscious experience is not only an internal construct but also an extremely selective way of representing information. This is why it is a tunnel: What we see and hear, or what we feel and smell and taste, is only a small fraction of what actually exists out there. Our conscious model of reality is a lowdimensional projection of the inconceivably richer physical reality surrounding and sustaining us. Our sensory organs are limited: They evolved for reasons of survival, not for depicting the enormous wealth and richness of reality in all its unfathomable depth. Therefore, the ongoing process of conscious experience is not so much an image of reality as a tunnel through reality, claims Metzinger.According to the author, the phenomenal Ego is not some mysterious thing or little man inside the head but the content of an inner image‚Äînamely, the conscious self-model. By placing the self-model within the world-model, a center is created. That center is what we experience as ourselves, the Ego.Metziner claims that much of our self-models are transparent, by which he means that we are unaware of the medium through which information reaches us. We do not see the window but only the bird flying by. We do not see neurons firing away in our brain but only what they represent for us. A conscious world-model active in the brain is transparent if the brain has no chance of discovering that it is a model‚Äîwe look right through it, directly onto the world, as it were. The central claim of this book is that the conscious experience of being a self emerges because a large part of the phenomenal self-model in your brain is transparent.The book is split into three parts. Part One focuses on the consciousness problem. This is where we go for a little tour of our Ego Tunnel to find out that the homunculus in your head is nowhere to be found. Part Two is about ideas and discoveries. A lot is packed in here: body image, out-of-body experiences, the virtual self, free will, lucid dreams, empathy, etc.Part Three is where we hear about artificial ego machines, consciousness technologies, the image of humankind and a consciousness ethics. You will also find Metzinger‚Äôs thoughts about consciousness-altering drugs and meditation. If you are familiar with works of Sam Harris, it almost feels like Metzinger was his European twin brother. Even if this was an exaggeration, they focus on a lot of similar topics and often come to compatible conclusions.‚ÄúEgo Tunnel‚Äù is a dense reading. A lot is packed into these 240 pages (not counting notes and index). I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a lucid dream, so to me it was interesting to learn what it was. It was, indeed, interesting to see the topic of dreams raised in a book about consciousness. ‚ÄúIf you are conscious, a world appears to you. This is true in dreams as well as in the waking state, but in dreamless deep sleep, nothing appears: The fact that there is a reality out there and that you are present in it is unavailable to you; you do not even know that you exist,‚Äù rightly notes the author.According to Metzinger, the most interesting feature of ordinary dreams leads to some deeper philosophical considerations about the nature of consciousness. The dream tunnel is generated in a very special configuration: During REM sleep, as noted, there is an output blockade, responsible for the paralysis of the sleeper, and there is an input blockade, which prevents (at least to a degree) sensory signals in the sleeper‚Äôs environment from penetrating conscious experience. At the same time, chaotic internal signals are generated by what are known as PGO waves. They are electrical bursts of neural activity named for the brain areas involved (the pons, the lateral geniculate nucleus in the hypothalamus, and the occipital primary visual cortex) and are closely related not only to eye movements but also to the processing of visual information. As the brain tries to understand and interpret this chaotic internal pattern of signals, it starts telling itself a fairy tale, with the dream ego playing the leading role. The interesting point is that the dream Ego does not know that it is dreaming. Concerning lucid dreams, it is plausible to assume that lucidity depends on the degree to which the prefrontal cortex, where the organizing of cognitive and social behaviors takes place and the so-called executive functions are located, can form a stable functional link with other brain regions that generate the conscious dream self. The prefrontal cortex is thought to arrange thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals. It also has to do with differentiation among conflicting thoughts, planning, assessing future consequences of current activities, predicting outcomes, generating expectations, and the like.Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) is another fascinating issue. Metzinger himself had such episodes in youth. It was interesting to learn how such experiences could be caused by direct electrical brain stimulation and how brain lesions or dysfunctions at the temporo-parietal junction could be related to OBEs. Of course, you probably wouldn‚Äôt need a philosopher to read about neuroscience. Why not read neuroscientific literature directly? But Metzinger offers, and maybe rightly so, that brain and consciousness research should be integrated with or even incorporated into Humanities. I agree, when philosophers who write about consciousness dig deep into hard sciences, their works turn to be much more coherent and relevant. Interesting examples are Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers. So Part III is where Metzinger really shows his expertise as a philosopher of mind, grappling with the consequences of recent scientific discoveries, IMHO posing more open-ended questions than providing definitive answers. And that strategy is not bad at all. He makes a number of interesting claims. One is that we should beware of bringing artificial ego machines (AGI is a more familiar term) into existence. No, if you think Metzinger is another author worried about survival of humanity, it is one but not an exclusive concern. He is worried about bringing more suffering into the world, including suffering of those artificial beings. In fact, according to him we ourselves are Ego Machines, while our Ego Tunnel is similar to virtual reality.Another is that humans need a new branch of applied ethics‚Äîconsciousness ethics. In traditional ethics, we ask, ‚ÄúWhat is a good action?‚Äù Now we must also ask, ‚ÄúWhat is a good state of consciousness?‚Äù He claims that a desirable state of consciousness should satisfy at least three conditions: It should minimize suffering, in humans and all other beings capable of suffering; it should ideally possess an epistemic potential (that is, it should have a component of insight and expanding knowledge); and it should have behavioral consequences that increase the probability of the occurrence of future valuable types of experience. He points out that consciousness ethics is not about phenomenal experience alone. It would complement traditional ethics by focusing on those acts whose primary goal is the alteration of one‚Äôs own experiential states or those of other persons. Given the new potentials for such acts, as well as the risks associated with them, and given our lack of moral intuition in this area, the task is to assess the ethical value of various kinds of subjective experience as such. All in all, this is an interesting reading for people interested in philosophy of mind. What a nice break from all that postmodern gibberish coming from continental Europe."
17,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,4,"Thomas Metzinger is one of those rare philosophers who take neuro-science and cognitive science and the implications coming from the extensive research on the brain and consciousness seriously. In fact, seriously enough to engage in cognitive science research himself and in collaboration with other scientists. The importance for this engagement cannot be overly emphasized!Most of the book is an argument for the ""self"" as an emergent phenomenon of our biology, which in certainly backed by the evidence from neuroscience and is very much in alignment with the buddhist understanding of the self. The ""Ego Tunnel"" is Metzinger's term for the self as a ""tunnel-visioned experience of the world."" This tunneling has allowed for the emergence of self-awareness and self-reflection, but it has also led to much of ""the world"" left out. As the buddha might say, the phenomenological world is a mental formation.The really important implication from this and the fact that ever more technologies are being created that can manipulate and even control the experience of the self raises some novel and rather serious ethical questions. Are there better or worse states of consciousness? Are there states of consciousness that should be outlawed? Should we use technology to attain ""better"" states of consciousness? Ultimately, Metzinger is arguing for the necessity of a morally sensitive philosophy of mind.His final chapter, ""A New Kind of Ethics"" offers the first tentative steps toward such a philosophy. As he points out, ""In the past, we have not arrived at a convincing assessment of the intrinsic value of ... artificially induced states of consciousness, of the risks and benefits they carry not only for the individual citizen but for society as a whole. We have simply looked the other way..... There is no way of 'doing nothing'; whatever we do has consequences. This is true for the problems of the past as well as for the new challenges we face in the future."" Sadly, I don't see our culture and society doing the homework. It seems to me that we'll plod along and then face new crises unprepared and ignorant.Metzinger also warns about how advertising and social media are effecting brain functionality and consciousness and offers this advice:""Every child has a right to be provided with a 'neurophenomenological toolbox' in school: at a minimum this should include two meditation techniques, one silent and one in motion; two standard techniques for deep relaxation...; two techniques for improving dream recall and inducing lucidity; and perhaps a course in what one might call 'media hygiene.""

I think it's a wonderful recap on neuroscience and the dawning realization of another path of science discovering its root paradox. This has happened in math with Godel's incompleteness theorems and Quantum Mechanics for physicists.A part for the whole can be seen in his basic misconception of Buddhism as a nihilistic path, when a cursory review would reveal Gautama and other Buddhists argue against both eternalism (e.g. no thing we can call our self persists between moments), nor nihilism (e.g. liberation can be realized). I'd recommend some zazen prior to cracking the last loop in that dependent chain of thought of what this means for all of us.My heart really wishes he had engaged with those scientists in his ""lucid dream"" a bit longer.

Using modern philosophy and cognitive neuroscience, philosopher Thomas Metzinger shatters any notion of the self while making difficult concepts such as the nature of consciousness accessible to the masses. This book was a very educational and enlightening experience. This 288-page book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. The Appearance of the World, 2. A Tour of the Tunnel, 3. Out of the Body and Into the Mind, 4. From Ownership to Agency to Free Will, 5. Philosophical Psychonautics, 6. The Empathic Ego, 7. Artificial Ego Machines, 8. Consciousness Technologies and the Image of Humankind, and 9. A New Kind of Ethics.Positives:1.	Great overall book. A treat to read, from cover to cover. 2.	Great science writing. It‚Äôs well written and accessible to the masses.3.	Fascinating topics of neuroscience and conveyed in a masterful manner. 4.	Great use of diagrams that helps illustrate studies and concepts.5.	Relies on cutting-edge scientific studies to demonstrate his thesis. 6.	Best explanation of the nature of consciousness that I have read. The ‚ÄúEgo Tunnel‚Äù is a clever and effective way to teach conscious experience.7.	Introduces new concepts that are helpful in understanding the overall thesis. As an example, the concept of phenomenal self-model (PSM).8.	Fabulous job of explaining out-of-body experiences (OBEs). What an OBE is. A real treat.9.	Defines all terms all terms used adequately. As an example, the ego, consciousness, etc...10.	A good balance of science and philosophy. ‚ÄúMy interest in philosophy is nurtured by the evidence that progress in neurobiology will provide some answers to the classic questions treated in philosophy‚Äù.11.	The author is very careful in establishing that the science of consciousness is in its early stages. 12.	The author establishes the following six problems in defining a convincing theory of consciousness: One-World Problem, the Now Problem, the Reality Problem, the Ineffability Problem, the Evolution Problem and the Who Problem.13.	Evolution applied to the brain. 14.	How humans became more intelligent over time.15.	Really clarifies how the brain works. Excellent!16.	 The four main types of autoscopy (the experience of viewing your body from a distance: autoscopic hallucination, heautoscopy, out-of-body experience, and the ‚Äúfeeling of a presence‚Äù.17.	Great quotes, ‚Äúwe must view the brain as a reality engine: It is a system that constantly makes assumptions about what exists and what doesn‚Äôt, thereby creating an inner reality including time, space, and causal relations‚Äù.18.	Our increasing knowledge of how are brain works has ethical implications.19.	Fascinating facts: ‚Äúblind people are sometimes able to see in dreams‚Äù.20.	Dreaming‚Ä¶lucid dreams.21.	The implications of mirror neurons.22.	The evolutionary precursor of language.23.	Some studies will amaze you‚Ä¶‚Äùcockroaches with surgically implanted backpacks‚Äù.24.	An interesting look at artificial intelligence.25.	Debunks the Judeo-Christian image of a human being. No such thing as immortal souls.26.	The future of neuroscience. Neuroethics.27.	Links worked great on the Kindle!28.	Worthy of multiple reads.Negatives:1.	Neuroscience is in fact a young science and as new findings emerge, some of the theories in this book will either be put aside or modified. As an example, fMRI does not reveal what is going on at the micro level of neurons. 2.	Very little discussion on the impact of brain injuries. 3.	If you can‚Äôt comprehend the analogy of the tunnel, you will not get this book. 4.	Neuroscience even at its most basic level will challenge the layperson.5.	Some theists may object to some of the conclusions of the book. Never let your faith get in the way of the facts.In summary, I really enjoyed this book. I have read a number of books on neuroscience, the science of the mind, but this is one of my favorites because it gave me the best understanding on how our brains model the world. The author establishes early on his central claim of the book; the self-model theory of subjectivity and provides compelling arguments in its defense. In other words, he was able to explain the concept of consciousness in such a way that a layperson can understand it. Just being able to frame the question in a way that can be understood is an accomplishment. This is a thought-provoking book that mixes philosophical questions with scientific-based answers; in short, my kind of book. For an intellectual and accessible treat, I highly recommend this book.Further suggestions: ""The Believing Brain..."" and ""Why People Believe Weird Things"" by Michael Shermer, ""Human"" and ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs In Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain‚Äù by Michael S.

How does chemistry account for that, for me, for my feeling of identity? In other words. What is the physical foundation of consciousness?"" -STEVEN STROGATZI‚Äôm duly impressed with Mr. Metzinger‚Äôs ‚ÄúEgo Tunnel‚Äù. In short longevity of my quest for origins and final frontiers I've been spending some time on each side, forward and back - dealing with non-living matter, then with the life itself, or if you want - with living matter. The consciousness was the only topics I was afraid tampering with, and for that reason delayed to engage it for quite long. Whenever delved into that scary ‚Äúsoulish‚Äù thing I found myself on wide and blurred highway of lost theories straying between the reality and meta realms leading into nowhere.And on that highway of mess Thomas Metzinger is starting with his scientific tale unfolding it with high language precision revealing all the latest we humans know about ourselves thanks to achievements of cognitive neuroscience. I‚Äôm about to avoid getting into details of his masterpiece leaving to the reader the fun and experience of exploration, thus rather will give a short concise insight into the tunnel of Ego:When Antonie van Leeuwenhoek looked at the living world through the first good microscopes in the 1670s, he saw totally unsuspected, hidden orders of being. In short order he discovered bacteria, spermatozoa, and the banded structure of muscle fibers. Likewise, when Galileo Galilei first turned a telescope to the sky in the 1610s, new riches appeared: he found spots on the Sun, mountains on the Moon, moons around Jupiter, and multitudes of stars in the Milky Way. Now take a look into a reality! What we see and hear, or what we feel and smell and taste, is only a small fraction of what actually exists out there. Our conscious model of reality is a low dimensional projection of the inconceivably richer physical reality surrounding and sustaining us. Our sensory organs are limited: They evolved for reasons of survival, not for depicting the enormous wealth and richness of reality in all its unfathomable depth. Now, imagine the human brain for a moment! This, actually ugly, bloody even taste badly organ is sitting inside in every skull in the total darkness owning an avatar with sensory system that helps to her or him in inventing more and more precise sense-enhancing devices in his final quest to figure out his own origin, purpose, and meaning of existence. But, actually, the ultimate sense-enhancing device, the Big Kahuna of all devices in the entire Universe is a thinking mind, that beside of the daily survival routines is making all the efforts to dig a tunnel into surrounding reality to solve its mystery, and the mystery of self as well, by virtually projecting itself in the center of it. The Brain and Mind, the Self ‚Äì the crossroad on highway we will embark and travel with Mr. Metzinger who will explain this tremendous secret and provide most of answers on ever repeating questions like, how he formulated: ‚ÄúWhy is there always someone having the experience? Who is the feeler of our feelings and the dreamer of our dreams? Who is the agent doing the doing and what is the entity thinking our thoughts?‚ÄùIs there a soul? Is there a little man within? Through the experimental results of cognitive neuroscience we‚Äôll have our answers, and some will believe, but many will doubt and deny: that to the best of our current knowledge there is no thing, no indivisible entity that is us, neither in the brain nor in some metaphysical realm beyond this world. But, you'll be surprised once face that the importance of this book is not to explain the mystery of conscious mind, at least it‚Äôs not the only goal, but to lead us to the implications and consequences of these doubts and denials on further fate, nemesis of the human kind. Because,it is not a question whether we‚Äôll be able to alter the quality of consciousness in near future ‚Äì it is within the reach of neuroscience, but rather the question is, what kind of consciousness we‚Äôd like to have for the future generations. Answer to these questions however are of philosophical nature, and we are unfortunately still out of range to address them."
26,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8082349-kevin,4,"With this book, Metzinger furthers an encouraging trend in academia: superstar theoreticians are writing accounts of their work for the layman. His book is carved into three parts. The first summarizes his theory of consciousness, as rigorously developed in Being No One. The second introduces his theory of self-hood in the context of clinical neuroscience. The third discusses the imminent social conflict that will erupt as the public acquaints itself with the increasingly-surprising results of cognitive science. Criticisms:M fails to adequately consider evolutionary mechanisms other than natural selection. Some textual evidence from pg 43: ""in principle, consciousness could be a by-product of other traits that paid for themselves, but [its stability] over time suggests that it was adaptive.""While M excels at presenting cutting-edge research, he often neglects to leave his readers with tools for further research. I kept hoping that he would cite the concepts of ""umwelt"" and ""semiosphere"" but he never did. Also, pages 111-113 were stunningly eloquent, but if I had not read the physiological journals beforehand, I would have completely missed the fact that M was describing the theory of pain known as the neuromatrix. The text is laced with insinuations of consensus. While this is often applicable in surprising ways (scholars agree that thoughts can be inferred from lab equipment), M can cast this authoritative weight inappropriately (his self-less Ego theory is itself immersed in controversy).Praise: M's exceptionally lucid writing style, combined with a compelling bird's eye view of genuinely pivotal cogsci research, makes this a compelling read. The wealth of illuminating graphics didn't hurt either.Three sections stood out as independently valuable. Chapter 2 explores six themes: the One-World Problem, the Now Problem, the Reality Problem, the Ineffability Problem, and the Who Problem. I found this journey to be compelling, and it left me itching to buy M's magnum opus (Being No One). In addition to this, Chapter 3's discussion of Out-Of-Body experiences stitched together a fascinating collection of research. Finally, chapter 7 included a well-overdue discussion of the effects of, and viable policy strategies towards, nootropics.Conclusion:I warmly recommend this book. A tasty quote to conclude (pg 20):""The evening sky is colorless. The world is not inhabited by colored objects at all. It is just as your physics teacher in high school told you: Out there, in front of your eyes, there is just an ocean of electromagnetic radiation, a wild and raging mixture of different wavelengths. Most of them are invisible to you and can never become part of your conscious model of reality. What is really happening is that your brain is drilling a tunnel through this inconceivably rich physical environment and in the process painting the tunnel walls in various shades of color. Phenomenal color. Appearance."""
27,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"Yes, yet another book on consciousness but a pretty good one. Thomas Metzinger is a philosopher who heavily collaborated with a number of neuroscientists and his perspective is fairly technical. Not as technical as the ""quest for consciousness"" by Christof Koch but certainly more technical than the likes of Daniel Dennett.""The ego tunnel"" is a general audience version of his magnum opus ""being no one‚Äù which quite frankly is too long and too expensive.The book is uneven ‚Äì some chapters are excellent, but some (e.g. on lucid dreaming/OBEs and ethics) left me uninspired; hence the four stars. That said, the good chapters more than compensate for occasional duds.He starts out by outlining a few issues that any theory of consciousness has to explain:‚Ä¢	coherence of a unified world perception.‚Ä¢	The notion of ""now"" and its purpose and representation‚Äì the notion of reality and its relation to phenomenal self‚Ä¢	subjective qualia and its ineffability‚Ä¢	evolutionary perspective and an attempt at explanation‚Ä¢	finally the question of who. The agency problem.Metzingers own theory revolves around transparent phenomenal self model and what he calls the ""ego tunnel"". It boils down to the following ‚Äì we don't perceive the outside world directly, rather what we perceive is the brain‚Äôs transparent simulation of a subset of objective reality. That transparency is the key to his theory. Metaphorically speaking the brain constructs the tunnel through reality and the ‚Äúego‚Äù becomes the content of that tunnel. But both the ego and the tunnel are transparent. And the best part, for my money, that the only logically consistent outcome that falls out of this is that in the end there is no self to speak of ‚Äì and the answer to the question of who is doing the perception/experiencing the world/having the qualia etc is - no one. I recognize that my explanation above may sound like a postmodern mysticism, but fear not, Metzingers argument is technical, supported by rich set of relevant studies and references, and very much grounded in latest neuroscientific developments every step of the way.By the way, there's a nice chapter that stands on its own which covers ‚Äúmirror neurons‚Äù popularized by the famous V.S. Ramachandran. A very nice introduction to the subject. It relates to Metzingers main argument by showing how both the first-person and third person perspectives can coexist in the brain and it takes the whole notion of simulation to whole new level. And again, believe me this is very different from Baudrillard's 'Simulacra and Simulation' which is excellent but for very different reasons. "

Metzinger does a nice job of asking the right questions and creating a context within which to consider them even though he doesn't offer any concrete solutions. He is leaving that up to society to do instead, which makes sense here. The issues should be resolved through what the people want since their individual autonomy may be impacted here rather than what the government feels is appropriate.I found this book to be an interesting read as it mixes science with philosophy.

This, in turn, led to other Phenomenological philosophers, philosophers who were influenced by Husserl and/or Phenomenology and the background, and uses, of their research technique. It's all very interesting, so far.

Although, to be sure, from a scientific perspective, I don't believe there is any new ground being covered. The author explains how biological evolution provided us not only with consciousness but also with a self-model, an Ego that perceives the outside world in first-person mode. What our Ego experiences as ‚Äòreality‚Äô, Metzinger calls our Ego Tunnel. Which is only a relatively simple representation of what is out there, because reality is endlessly richer than we are able to experience. Our specific human ‚Äòtunnel‚Äô is just one of many possible ways in which conscious beings can model reality. Because of our sense of having an Ego, we are used to think of ourselves as posessing a distinct ‚Äòself‚Äô, an entity that is ‚Äòin charge‚Äô, or even a ‚Äòsoul‚Äô. However, based on an ever increasing amount of neuroscientific findings, we know that none of those things are likely to exist. There is no little man in the head, no essence within us that stays the same across time, nothing that could not in principle be divided into parts. The ‚Äòself‚Äô cannot even be an illusion, because there is no one that could have this illusion. (But hey, this is really nothing new. This point has been very presciently and acutely made in Buddhist psychology 2500 years ego. It is only in recent times that we can corroborate this ancient notion of ‚Äòanatta‚Äô (no-self) with some serious evidence.)Metzinger is a philosopher who seems to have a good enough grasp of cognitive neuroscience and who's able to explain technical intricacies quite lucidly. Far from being an expert on the subject myself, I can't really say if Metzinger is heavily cherry picking the science literature, but I suspect that when it comes to some of his claims, neuroscientist might have some bones to pick with the author. I don't think, however, that those disagreements would affect his overall theory and conclusions.In the last two chapters the author goes a little off the rails in discussing the possible consequences of our rapidly expanding knowledge and possibilities in the field of consciousness. He also provides some provocative starting points for a future ethics that takes these new possibilities into account. Metzinger wants to bring us the raw, naturalistic and biological facts of life as we now understand them. He knows his conclusions will meet with a lot of resistance, especially from religious people. ‚ÄúSince our inbuilt existential need for full emotional and physical security can never be fulfilled, we have a strong drive toward delusion and bizarre belief systems. Psychological evolution endowed us with the irresistible urge to satisfy our emotional need for stability and emotional meaningfulness by creating metaphysical worlds and invisible persons.‚ÄùInstead of giving in to this ‚Äòconstant temptation to sacrifice intellectual honesty in favor of emotional well-being‚Äô, we should face up to the facts of our biology and find a spiritual path to understand and expand our consciousness, re-evaluate our ethics to accommodate new challenges and strive toward a ‚Äòconsciousness culture‚Äô.""Developing a consciousness culture will mean expanding the Ego Tunnel and exploring the space of altered states of consciousness in ways from which we all can profit. The interplay of virtual-reality technology, new psychoactive substances, ancient psychological techniques such as meditation, and future neurotechnology will introduce us to a universe of self-exploration barely imaginable today.""I personally feel quite at home with this notion of pure intellectual honesty in the search for a secular form of spirituality. And by spirituality I mean a way of rising above our animal selves, examining and letting go of our search for emotional security and transcending the apparent boundaries of the self by expanding and nurturing our attention and insight.Though in the very last sentences of the book, Metzinger doesn't let me off easily:""The greatest theoretical challenge may consist in the questions of whether and how, given our new situation, intellectual honesty and spirituality can ever be reconciled. But that is another story."""

Our conscious model of reality is a low-dimensional projection of the inconceivably richer physical reality surrounding and sustaining us.Whenever our brains successfully pursue the ingenious strategy of creating a unified and dynamic inner portrait of reality, we become conscious.First, our brains generate a world-simulation, so perfect that we do not recognize it as an image in our minds. Then, they generate an inner image of ourselves as a whole. This image includes not only our body and our psychological states but also our relationship to the past and the future, as well as to other conscious beings.The internal image of the person-as-a-whole is the phenomenal Ego, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚Äúself ‚Äù as it appears in conscious experienceWe are not in direct contact with outside reality or with ourselves, but we do have an inner perspective. We can use the word ‚ÄúI.‚Äù We live our conscious lives in the Ego Tunnel.A conscious world-model active in the brain is transparent if the brain has no chance of discovering that it is a model‚Äîwe look right through it, directly onto the world, as it were.it can become the Ego only because you are constitutionally unable to realize that all this is just the content of a simulation in your brain.The Ego is a transparent mental image: You‚Äîthe physical person as a whole‚Äîlook right through it. You do not see it. But you see with it.What would it mean for an Ego Tunnel to branch out to include other Ego Tunnels? What happens to the Ego Tunnel during the dream state? Can machines possess an artificial form of self-consciousness, and can they develop a proper Ego Tunnel? How do empathy and social cognition work; how can communication take place from one tunnel to the next? Finally, of course, we must ask: Is it possible to leave the Ego Tunnel?"
37,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3523441-raul,3,"""Mortality, for us, is not only an objective fact but a subjective chasm, an open wound in our phenomenal self-model. We have a deep, inbuilt existential conflict, and we seem to be the first creatures on this planet to experience it consciously. Many of us, in fact, spend our lives trying to avoid experiencing it. Maybe this feature of our self-model is what makes us inherently religious: We are this process of trying to become whole again, to somehow reconcile what we know with what we feel should not be so. In this sense, the Ego is the longing for immortality. The Ego results in part from the constant attempt to sustain its own coherence and that of the organism harboring it; thereby arises the constant temptation to sacrifice intellectual honesty in favor of emotional well-being. The Ego evolved as an instrument in social cognition, and one of its greatest functional advantages was that it allowed us to read the minds of other animals or conspecifics‚Äîand then to deceive them. Or deceive ourselves. Since our inbuilt existential need for full emotional and physical security can never be fulfilled, we have a strong drive toward delusion and bizarre belief systems. Psychological evolution endowed us with the irresistible urge to satisfy our emotional need for stability and emotional meaningfulness by creating metaphysical worlds and invisible persons. Whereas spirituality might be defined as seeing what is‚Äîas letting go of the search for emotional security‚Äîreligious faith can be seen as an attempt to cling to that search by redesigning the Ego Tunnel. Religious belief is an attempt to endow your life with deeper meaning and embed it in a positive metacontext‚Äîit is the deeply human attempt to finally feel at home. It is a strategy to outsmart the hedonic treadmill. On an individual level, it seems to be one of the most successful ways to achieve a stable state‚Äîas good as or better than any drug so far discovered. Now science seems to be taking all this away from us. The emerging emptiness may be one reason for the current rise of religious fundamentalism, even in secular societies. Yes, the self-model made us intelligent, but it certainly is not an example of intelligent design. It is the seed of subjective suffering. If the process that created the biological Ego Machine had been initiated by a person, that person would have to be described as cruel, maybe even diabolic. We were never asked if we wanted to exist, and we will never be asked whether we want to die or whether we are ready to do so. In particular, we were never asked if we wanted to live with this combination of genes and this type of body. Finally, we were certainly never asked if we wanted to live with this kind of a brain including this specific type of conscious experience. It should be high time for rebellion. But everything we know points to a conclusion that is simple but hard to come to terms with: Evolution simply happened‚Äîforesightless, by chance, without goal. There is nobody to despise or rebel against‚Äînot even ourselves. And this is not some bizarre form of neurophilosophical nihilism but rather a point of intellectual honesty and great spiritual depth."" * ""The ability to attend to our environment, to our own feelings, and to those of others is a naturally evolved feature of the human brain. Attention is a finite commodity, and it is absolutely essential to living a good life. We need attention in order to truly listen to others‚Äîand even to ourselves. We need attention to truly enjoy sensory pleasures, as well as for efficient learning. We need it in order to be truly present during sex or to be in love or when we are simply contemplating nature. Our brains can generate only a limited amount of this precious resource every day."""
38,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Consciousness is the appearance of a world. The essence of the phenomenon of conscious experience is that a single and unified reality becomes present: If you are conscious, a world appears to you.Conscious experience, however, is much more than physics plus biology‚Äîmore than a fantastically complex, dancing pattern of neural firing in your brain. What sets human consciousness apart from other biologically evolved phenomena is that it makes a reality appear within itself. It creates inwardness; the life process has become aware of itself.Conscious experiences are full-blown mental models in the representational space opened up by the gigantic neural network in our heads‚Äîand because this space is generated by a person possessing a memory and moving forward in time, it is a tunnel. The pivotal question is this: If something like this is taking place all the time, why don‚Äôt we ever become aware of it?Could deep meditation be the process, perhaps the only process, in which human beings can sometimes turn the global background into the gestalt, the dominating feature of consciousness itself? This assumption would fit in nicely with an intuition held by many, among others Antoine Lutz, namely that the fundamental subject/object structure of experience can be transcended in states of this kind.Although, strictly speaking, no such thing as Now exists in the outside world, it proved adaptive to organize the inner model of the world around such a Now‚Äîcreating a common temporal frame of reference for all the mechanisms in the brain so that they can access the same information at the same time. Ait is an illusion. As modern-day neuroscience tells us, we are never in touch with the present, because neural information-processing itself takes time. Signals take time to travel from your sensory organs along the multiple neuronal pathways in your body to your brain, and they take time to be processed and transformed into objects, scenes, and complex situations. So, strictly speaking, what you are experiencing as the present moment is actually the past.the robust illusion of being directly in touch with the outside world has to do with the speed of neural information-processing in our brains. Further, subjective experience is not generated by one process alone but by various interacting functions: multisensory integration, short-term memory, attention, and so on. My theory says that, in essence, consciousness is the space of attentional agency: Conscious information is exactly that set of information currently active in our brains to which we can deliberately direct our high-level attention.when speaking about ‚Äúqualities‚Äù and color experiences, we were actually misdescribing states of our own bodies, internal states we never recognized as such‚Äîthe walls of the Ego Tunnel.Conscious experience, too, is an interface, an invisible, perfect internal medium allowing an organism to interact flexibly with itself. It is a control device. It functions by creating an internal user interface‚Äîan ‚Äúas if ‚Äù (that is, virtual) reality. It filters information, has a high bandwidth, is unambiguous and reliable, and generates a sense of presence. More important, it also generates a sense of self. The self-model is much like the mouse pointer on the virtual desktop of your PC‚Äîor the little red arrow on the subway map that advises ‚ÄúYou are here.‚Äù It places you at the center of a behavioral space,Ego is a fiction; however, it is also a wonderfully efficient control device. You could also say that it is an entirely new window on reality."
39,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88437239-jakob,4,"Philosopher Thomas Metzinger here presents his theory of the self. He argues that the self is a mental construct, and that in reality there are no selves. The title of Ego Tunnel is his metaphor for our experience of the world; only a small percentage of what is really out there ever reaches our conscious experience. Our lives are spent within the confines of a tunnel made of our own sensory perceptions, blocking out everything beyond their grasp. That is the world as we know it.In Metzinger's words, our conscious experience is ‚Äúa low-dimensional projection of the inconceivably richer physical reality surrounding and sustaining us"".Within that ego tunnel of a world, we have a sense of being a self, a subject in control of its own actions. This view is false, says Metzinger. What you have is not a self but a ""phenomenal self-model"". This is the brain's model of the organism as a whole, including a model of our body, our control of attention, and so forth. This is not a thing but a process, that took a step up from our subconscious sometime during evolutionary history in order to give us more control over our experience. Metzinger:‚ÄúIn its origin, the Ego is a neurocomputational device for appropritating and controlling the body, first the physical one and then the virtual one‚Äù.He has included lots of evidence from neuroscience that concur with his theories, and gives them a philosophical context. The book goes on to explore the implications of psychoactive drugs, lucid dreaming, artifical intelligence, and the need for what Metzinger calls a ""consciousness culture""; giving people the freedom to discover states of consciousness that enrich and give happiness to our lives. ‚ÄúUnless the interests of others are directly threatened, people ought to be free to explore their own minds and design their own conscious reality-models according to their wishes, needs, and beliefs‚Äù. Amen. Apart from that, this last third of the book is the weakest. It appears to be not much more than some thoughts on what the future could bring if we take what we are finding out about conscious experience seriously.However, I have lenghty passages marked on my Kindle since they illuminate stuff I have been trying to formulate in my own mind, without the vocabulary to do so. For one, here is a nice rendition of how our illusion of free will is created:‚ÄúWe now have a theory in hand that explains how subpersonal brain events (for instance, those that specify action goals and assemble suitable motor commands) can become the contents of the conscious self. When certain processing stages are elevated to the level of conscious experience and bound into the self-model active in your brain, they become available for all your mental capacities. Now you experience them as your own thoughts, decisions, or urges to act‚Äîas properties that belong to you,the person as a whole. It is also clear why these events popping up in the conscious self necessarily appear spontaneous and uncaused. They are the Ô¨Årst link in the chain to cross the border from unconscious to conscious brain processes; you have the impression that they appeared in your mind ‚Äúout of the blue,‚Äù so to speak. The unconscious precursor is invisible, but the link exists.‚Äù"
40,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90717873-lis,4,"It wasn‚Äôt an easy read. And not so pleasant one. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a little pissed off. But I realized soon enough, that it wasn't happening because the book was bad or anything but because the main idea was 
as counterintuitive as it could possibly be for a human being
. It‚Äôs curiously nagging to be told that there is no ‚Äúyou‚Äù inside you, which is just an illusion that had accidentally appeared somewhere during the evolution. But there was the warning beforehand, right? And the reason to start reading was this intriguing title, wasn‚Äôt it? So I got on with reading because I felt it‚Äôs important to understand this point of view, whether I would share it or not.This book is an attempt 
to bridge the gap between modern neuroscience and philosophy of mind
. Thomas Metzinger builds his philosophical theory of self using the results of neuroscience researches like the rubber hand illusion, the alien hand syndrome, out-of-body experience and phantom limb syndrome. He claims that many widespread philosophical, psychological and religious ideas, first of all, the idea of separability of mind and body, spiritual primacy and human superiority contradict recent scientific findings. It‚Äôs really very difficult to believe in all these things when it is shown to you that the science has proved that our precious mind and consciousness can be easily destroyed by brain or psyche damage, manipulated by electric brain stimulation and can be presented in other living creatures. Thomas Metzinger uses scientific tool and stays rational till the end that goes with 
atheism and materialism
. The author doesn‚Äôt try to provide an extended overview of many concepts that exist or existed in the field. So yeah, he doesn‚Äôt speak about Buddhism or Carlos Castaneda. I don‚Äôt think that this book is able to persuade a religious person to change his or her mind. But if you are already here, searching for additional information and reasons 
to break up with mysticism
, the book can be of big value to you helping you to see more and make sense of your life. For example, thanks to the book I‚Äôve decided to practice non-religious meditation. And I‚Äôve become way more patient to other people after realizing that there is no such thing as ‚Äúreality‚Äù for us and that all of us are floating in illusions and the question is just which ones."
41,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12031280-paul,4,"Fascinating -- may I say mind-blowing? book about the nature of consciousness and the self, with an additional section on the coming ethics quandaries about creating artificial consciousness.I read it twice and found parts of it still difficult to follow. The self is apparently nothing more than an image of the world the brain creates through its circuitry. It's not real, and neither are our sensations of the world -- they are once removed and highly filtered. We are ""naive realists"" -- unaware we are not dealing with reality. To me, though, this approach seems to beg the question. An image presupposes an observer. So to say there is no self, just an image created by the brain, is like saying there is no self, just an image created by the brain which the self experiences.Metzinger goes on to explain that this image created by the brain is why we have this subjective experience, and are not zombies who simply respond to external stimuli through purely mechanical means. But I still don't get why conscious subjective experience is necessary; why the world can't simply be inhabited by zombies governed by their biological processes. I.e., even I can write a simple artificial intelligence program -- if I have a device that can detect red, yellow and green, I can set up a simple ""if...then"" loop instructing it how to respond in each case. Surely I might be able to add some additional layer of code creating an ""image"" of the machine while it makes this decision (though I'm hard-put to figure out just what that code would contain), but in the end how would it impact the behavior of the AI? It would seem just to be an unnecessary layer of code.Since Metzinger is clearly smarter than I, I imagine I don't have any of this quite right. Maybe I need to read it 3x.Ultimately, though, I suspect that we have the subjective experience of consciousness because consciousness is the default setting of the universe -- as David Chalmers puts it, it is one of the properties of the universe."
42,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59817380-yelena-dubovaya,4,"I think the enjoyment of a book like this loosely relates to one's experience on the matter, and how novel certain ideas are to that individual. My knowledge on theories of consciousness is relatively limited, so to me - especially the chapter on empathic ego was absolutely amazing. I do think that Metzinger tried to cover a lot of ground, which resulted in glossing over many ideas. Overall, I think it's a good place to start if someone is trying to better understand consciousness and the different approaches scientists and philosophers take into honing in on what it really means..  My 'sensation and perception' professor explained that we experience the world around us through our senses which he described as five pinholes through which we experience the surrounding environment (he also mentioned that other organisms have different 'pinholes' such as electric eels which can sense electricity). Our brains create a model of the world based on the few senses we have, while distorting the true environment around us to highlight things like edges and shadows to make it easier for us to navigate. Metzinger's idea of a tunnel was not a far reach from how consciousness had been explained to be before. Really loved the ch5 appendix with Allan Hobson and thoroughly enjoyed learning about mirror neurons and their relationship to empathy. "
43,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63656163-joseph-knecht,3,"The author argues that the conception of self is an illusion. In order for world and reality to appear to us, we must first create the concept of the self which exists in that reality. There is no reality without the self, and it that sense the self-illusion is mandatory in order for us to exist. The author describes out of body experience, lucid dreaming, drugs, limbo hand experiments which point into the direction of the illusionary self. Unfortunately, most of the writings in the book are of philosophical nature so no conclusive evidence yet. ""The central claim of this book is that the conscious experience of being a self emerges because a large portion of the self-model in your brain is, as philosophers would say, transparent. We are Ego Machines, but we do not have selves. We cannot leave the Ego Tunnel, because there is nobody who could leave. The Ego and its Tunnel are representational phenomena: They are just one of many possible ways in which conscious beings can model reality. Ultimately, subjective experience is a biological data format, a highly specific mode of presenting information."""
44,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,3,"I came across Thomas Metzinger on a recent Podcast and found him an interesting voice. I, therefore, approached this volume with high expectations. My reactions:1. I felt Mr. Metzinger made several observations that resonated, however, I felt his messaging disjointed and unorganized. He dwelled on his out of body experiences and brought in interviews with others, as if his editor had said, ""Tommy, this thing's a bit too light. You need to beef it up. More heft, man, more heft!"" The essence of this book could have been distilled into a volume one-third the size, which would make it something of a pamphlet?2. The Ego Tunnel metaphor didn't work for me. Maybe I'm an outlier? I depart from this work with a further conviction that perhaps the only reality in this experience of ours is that which I conceive; that there is no other truth. Now, what do I do with that information?3. I wish I came away with a better sense of how to live my life, in light of Mr. Metzinger's many, which I believe to be correct, observations about the human condition. I don't think I have, sadly.Three stars."
45,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28533619-jonathan,4,"A fascinating dive into our own minds. Over the course of this book Metzinger lays out the case that the self is a myth. It's not even an ""illusion"" because an illusion depends on a subject to delude, and there's not even that. We are all living inside a tunnel with the walls serving as the edges of our perceptiuon. Our thoughts are just another input generated by our brain, and as such are just something we experience, and are not really ""us"".Needless to say the book is mind-blowing, quite literally. The case is solid and is presented in an organized and methodical way. The high density of professional jargon makes it a very dense read so make room in your attention span for this one. The last chapter of this book talks about the ethical implications of the Ego Tunnel. It's interesting but I'd say it's the least interesting part of this work. I would've liked to see more empirical results that bolster the claims made in this book.All in all a very interesting read. A must-read for anyone interested in the nature of consciousness and philosophy of the mind."
46,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5427736-christine,3,"Got off to a strong start, but became less interesting. I realize this book is written for laypeople (well-written and clear) but I was disappointed that there was so little to engage with--the book contains a lot of pronouncements but not many arguments, and a lot of the ideas were already familiar to me through my readings on Buddhism.In particular, his discussion of the ethical and social implications of the new philosophy of consciousness was shallow because he has a naive tech-bro optimism about what technology can/will do for humankind (i.e. uncritically believes that psychotropic drugs on balance alleviate human misery and that neurological plastic surgery is right around the corner. Dude, they've been saying that since the introduction of Prozac and those predictions didn't pan out). In the last few pages he just tosses out dozens of pretty basic questions about the ethical issues but doesn't even try to answer any of them.Not to say this is a bad book. Just less substantial than I had expected."
47,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4167615-miklos,4,"I picked this book up after hearing Thomas Metzinger on Waking Up with Sam Harris. I have some understanding of consciousness research, but consider myself a layman. The Ego Tunnel is largely a theory on how consciousness is constructed through our sensory experiences, with other explorations of lucid dreaming, out of body experiences, and experiences born out of psychoactive drug use. The Tunnel is itself a construction of our own first person experiences, preventing any actual contact with our objective environment. He speaks to at length the slipperiness of the self and how it can be distorted in many of the above mentioned examples.Metzinger is a philosopher but relies on neurological research to bolster his claims. This has the benefit of a interdisciplinary perspective on consciousness research. However, for the lay reader (myself included), The Ego Tunnel can be compehensive and can be quite dense at times. Take your time."
48,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48171706-bob-miller,4,"This is a book for the layman, although it is quite deep. The tunnel metaphor is not great, but the sense of it grows on you. A couple of new abnormal psychologies were presented to fill out the underlying evidence to support Metzinger's theorem including ""alien hand syndrome"" (consider the movie Dr Strangelove). He provides an excellent description of how synchronized oscillatory discharges of neurons might produce a binding of distributed brain processes. He discusses evidence that tool use is supported by integrating the tool into the self model. He mentioned that Brocca's area of the brain is not only associated with language, but also represents the hand. Plenty more along those lines. There is significant discussion of moral and ethical issues in research related to consciousness, including pharmacology, neuroscience and AI. Much of the work advances the self model theory he introduced in Being No One. "

This book is nothing like that.It's more akin to one of those people who explains something in a way that only makes sense to people who already know what he's explaining.I can't even honestly judge the content.Some of it was spot on, but a lot of it was drenched in completely novel terminology making it hard to build a platform of comprehension to build upon.Who knows, it might have been bleeding edge science he was explaining, it might just as easily have been top shelve pseudo science.Maybe it's me, maybe comprehending the book was beyond my reach."
50,0465045677,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5585487-marc-huete,4,"A lot of very interesting ideas about the seat of consciousness. It changed my question from, 'who is speaking my inner monologue' to 'who is listening to it'. Some of the ideas you may have already encountered in other sources, if you're interested in topics like transhumanism, but there was no part I didn't enjoy reading. Dr. Metzinger makes the topic approachable and focuses on interesting questions. I only wish he played those questions out further (which, perhaps he would have, had it been written ten years later).If you enjoy these sorts of thoughts, I strongly recommend the fiction book Blindsight. I found Metzinger only because the author of Blindsight called him out specifically as an inspiration. But being fiction, Blindsight is able to take these ideas and play them out further and with more liberty than a non-fiction book."

Ego tunnel discusses how we create world and how things appear and what causes appearances. Out of body experience, lucid dreaming, free will, artificial minds... the final chapter brings up the idea of how consciousness might be manipulated, and the results could be dangerous or helpful depending who is at the helm. A difficult book, but if you are interested in thought about self and current studies on consciousness, you'll probably want to look at this book and Daniel Dennett's books too."

But, I think, Metzinger does a pretty good job at describing very difficult topics and ideas for the layman. The third part of the book, however, really was where all the ideas in the first two parts comes together. This was my personal favourite part of the book and in fact the most interesting. Metzinger brings up some fantastic concepts, thought experiments, ethical considerations and ways forward for consciousness research.If you‚Äôre at all interested in the science of the mind, consciousness or consciousness philosophy I recommend this to you. I‚Äôm very happy that I read this."

However, I had a hard time mapping my mental image of ""ego tunnel"" with the central thesis of the book. I wish the author could have chosen another metaphor or have described his metaphor in more details. At least for me, the tunnel has failed its purpose as in Daniel Dennett's term, an intuition pump. I also feels that part III of the book (mainly about new ethical problems raised by better understanding of human consciousness) is less interesting and weaker than the first two parts."

Metzinger traces many of the same concepts from more philosophical rather than neuroscientific perspectives, and raises and considers some interesting concepts. Metzinger occasionally lapses into culturally patronizing tones, but I especially liked his interviews with peers in different disciplines. Fair note: I read it on audiobook and found the narrator borderline unlistenable, but I tried hear past his tone and focus on the concepts. "

Of course, as others have pointed out, the ideas put forth here by Metzinger are not new because religions like Buddhism have preached them for millennia. However, Metzinger's work and analysis presents a more scientific (neurological and philosophical) foundation for the ""anatta"" concept. In addition, if I'm not mistaken, he is heavily influenced by many ideas of Buddhism. All in all, this is a thought-provoking book that has the potential to fundamentally alter the way you see not only the world but yourself as well. "

I think Metzinger selectively summarise some take away concept that try to elaborate the distinctive conscious experience in recent empirical research founding. It is all matter of perspective, although i agree we should put more value or account to renew the social cognitive thoery, it would be nice the reader with psychological background. "
