It's really for completests and neither a great nor terrible place to start for newcomers.For just such newbies to Feynman I will briefly disclose that he was a Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project in his youth and became famous not only for his professional skill but his quirky and irreverent public persona and his capabilities as an educator, both of the general public and of student physicists.This lecture was omitted from the famous three volumes of lectures based on a two year undergrad introductory course that Feynman taught at Caltech. It is a demonstration of the fact that planets orbit the sun in elipses if Newton's Law of Gravitation is correct and perturbations from all the other planets are ignored - using only plane geometry. Since only a few diagrams and notes from the lecture remained, along with a voice recording of it, it was quite a task to reconstruct the proof, which as is pointed out by Feynman himself is, whilst elementary, not simple. That said, the explanation of the demonstration could not be clearer and anybody who can follow school level geometry will be fine. Because there are a large number of diagrams, what appears to be a lengthy (and therefore possibly intimidating) wodge of physics is in fact something you could read and understand in a couple of hours easily.Additionally to the reconstruction and explanation of the proof, there is a mini-biography of Feynman which is best (as always) when telling anecdotes, not history, a transcript of Feynman delivering the lecture and a brief history of the relevant discoveries about the nature of the solar system, gravity and the way things move."

Basically in his unique engaging style Richard Feynman proves the motion of the planets around the sun, but with Geometry! Anyone with a piece of paper, pencil, determination and school maths could follow this with effort. I don't think any other science writer could have pulled this off. After reading it I found you get a new found respect for the audacity and cheekiness of Mr Newton, who not satisfied with just using calculus decided to prove it using geometry too! "
2,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084035-danil,5,"""I tried to find the simplest [demonstration:] that I could. It's still too hard for an ordinary human being"" -- Feynman's own comment on his demonstration.After his introduction, Feynman's demonstration proceeds in three parts: a review of some basic geometric properties of the ellipse; the geometric demonstration that elliptical orbits follow from the inverse square law, and then the application of the same ideas to atomic scattering and the discovery of the atomic nucleus.The intention is that the demonstration be ""elementary"", in the sense that it does not assume that the audience is already familiar with the antecedent material. It is, however, very quick: ""elementary does not mean easy to understand"". The lecture itself is a live recording in a lecture hall of freshman physics students who had already covered Newton's laws. The recording itself is good, but suffers a bit from the lack of visuals.The text is a supplement to the lecture, and includes background on the laws of gravitation, on Feynman, on the material within the lecture (Feynman ""Newton's demonstration is insufficiently elementary; I cooked up another one"". Goldstein ""maybe we should add a chapter connecting the dots""), and then a transcript of the lecture itself.The demonstration itself, while correct, is not necessarily rigorous - I found that the initial understanding I had after first listening to the lecture began to wilt under more careful examination."
3,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,3,"This is definitely a three-star book. The story of how the Goodsteins found and recreated Feynman's lost lecture on planetary movements is interesting; the image of David Goodstein holed up in a cruise ship cabin because he'd finally worked out the secret cracks me up. They're also good writers and their point-by-point explanation of Feynman's lecture is clear and easy to follow with only a basic understanding of high-school geometry.Unfortunately, the explanation is necessary because so much of Feynman's actual material has been lost. The reconstruction is good, but Feynman's lecture (the final chapter) loses some impact without the visual aids. I'm also annoyed at my library for not including the audio of the lecture on CD, as the cover copy promises; I think hearing it in his words would have enhanced the experience considerably. The book is probably of most interest to Feynman completists and students of science history, but in general it falls short of its promise."
4,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21430140-jerry,4,"I have the version with the CD. I think it helps, at least for the transcription portion of the book, to have Feynman’s cadence orally. The rest of the book stands up perfectly fine on its own. It begins with a history of Kepler, Brahe, Copernicus, and Galileo, how their discoveries led to the Newtonian revolution in how we think about the world.Then the authors write an expanded version of Feynman’s lecture. This is necessary if, like me—and unlike Feynman’s freshman class—you are decades past your high school geometry. The proofs really are elementary and basic—that is, at the high school level—and very visual, in the geometric sense. It is a fascinating glimpse into how Newton and his contemporaries thought, and how they—after Newton, at least—saw the universe."
5,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132592-matthew,3,"Another cool, clever read. Quick and interesting. Explains how newton worked out the nature of gravity and derived the elliptical orbit of planets through his three laws of physics. The arguments are far less esoteric and far more understandable than I (a non-student of physics since 14) anticipated, though of course they are the result of years of hard thinking and decades of astrological observation. The book also gives a glimpse of how 20th century physics (relativity and quantum mechanics) evolved from the newtonian system. Eyeopening and again I wish I'd read it before college. Why don't they give us stuff like this at O Level?"
6,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7860963-ross,5,Amazing what Feynman does with basic geometry. Accessible and clear.

READ THIS! 2, maybe 3 pee breaks and boom. Such ingenuity. I did not even know how to prove Kepler or Newton.. but Mr. Feynman has taught me now. And the bonus lesson of applying concepts to Rutherford experiment s. It was really fun to try it myself on paper.Only if someone could gift me the entire volume of Feynman lectures."
8,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1330476-kev,5,"This is a magnificent book.The collaboration between husban & wife team David & Judith Goodstein is generative, illuminating & ultimately profound.The math is beautiful. The reason for understanding the principles is farreaching & pragmatic at once. Truths live regardless of fashion or time. Feynman was a genius. I'm honored not only to understand this work but to celebrate it.You will embark upon a timejourney that reaches from Plato & Aristotle in 4th century BCE, to Ptolemy of the 2nd century CE, to Copernicus in the 16th, Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, Newton in the 17th, Maxwell in the 19th, Rutherford in the 19th/20th, Feynman, then Goodstein. It's a journey worth taking. You don't need to know any advanced math at all. All you have to recall is high school geometry. But as Feynman says: ""Elementary doesn't mean 'easy.' It may be elementary but it's difficult as hell."" HA! Exhilerating ride. Oh yeah! I forgot. The 4th chapter you get to follow along Feynman's original recorded lecture & listen as you read the transcript. "
9,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1479776-michael,5,"This lecture represents Feynman at his best! Play the audio CD & follow along in the book to see just how much enthusiasm & love he brings to his subject. The concepts he presents are fairly basic, but require some knowledge of high school geometry & physics.Feynman gave this lecture ""for fun"" - as a guest lecturer in the 1964 freshman physics course. He started out to explain Newton's proof of why planets have elliptical orbits around the sun - but departed from Newton's proof to use his own, much simpler (using basic geometry) proof, that he had ""cooked up"" at the last minute. The sheer joy with which he delivers this lecture is apparent on the recording.Along with his lecture on Algebra (The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol.1, Ch 22) - in which he starts with addition & proceeds logically through imaginary numbers (using only algebra & trigonometric functions) to derive Euler's formula - this book & CD combo show why Richard Philips Feynman was one of the most original thinkers in 20th Century physics."
10,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Feynman's Lost Lecture: Motion of Planets Around the Sun is a book based on a lecture by Richard Feynman. Restoration of the lecture notes and conversion into book form was undertaken by Caltech physicist David L. Goodstein and archivist Judith R. Goodstein. Feynman had given the lecture on the motion of bodies at Caltech on March 13, 1964, but the notes and pictures were lost for a number of years and consequently not included in The Feynman Lectures on Physics series. The lecture notes were later found, but unfortunately without the photographs of his illustrative chalkboard drawings. One of the editors, David L. Goodstein, stated that at first without the photographs, it was very hard to figure out what diagrams he was referring to in the audiotapes, but later finding of his own private lecture notes made it possible to understand completely the logical framework with which Feynman delivered the lecture.So I have the audio without those diagrams dot dot dot lol - so I am no further forward al la Feynman but I get the drift, if you catch my drift. "
11,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4378910-mobill76,3,"The title is irresistable. But, like most of my ""reading Feynman"" projects, it's more work than I thought it would be. He is, after all, a physicist.But, it's not a bad lecture and it comes with a story about how it was reconstructed. So, it's another labor of love for a man who makes us proud to be human.It's approximately the same level of material that's in Six Easy Pieces. I think I would've liked it better if I'd heard it before SEP. As it is, it was a lot of money for ""just one more lecture"".I'd say, ""Get it if you're considering getting SEP"". It's a taste of what you're getting yourself into."
12,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10175216-hrishikesh,5,"Incredible, incredible book. One of the most incredible things about this entire lecture is that Feynman proves Kepler's laws using just high school geometry. There is no fancier math tool used to do so. Simplification is the real test of genius.To be honest, I preferred the author's proof to Feynman's lecture; primarily because the lecture was verbatim and very difficult to understand without the diagrams used in the actual class. The way the authors have broken it down to a level where anyone can understand the proof is incredible. "
13,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1372388-vladimir,5,"Oddly fun read. Great combination of historical and scientific context plus an insightful application of elementary math. Multiple approaches to ellipses in general, and elliptical orbits in particular, come together really well in the end. Of course, everything applies to rockets and satellites as much as planets.I haven't read anything scientific or mathematical in a while, fortunately stumbled across this while packing."
14,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74206779-abdullah-bustami,4,"The second half of this book is complete mathematics.People majored in the field would find this book as a big treasure, but for those who are reading just for the sake of reading they will get bored very fast.That been said, Richard Feynman was truly a genius man, one of the best of the 20th century.But again, if you're not interested in Astronomy or geometrical math, then don't go for this one because you're not going to finish it."
15,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2108647-brian,2,"This book has motivated me find more material on Dick Feynman, but it is essentially 100 pages of proofs. Not good munching material when a hangover is lingering, but more deserving than two stars. The reviewer's expectations unfairly punish the book in this case. All in all a neat derivation of Newton's planetary motion laws."
16,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28571950-curious-me,5,"I read this for extra credit assignment for a physics class. The first half is all about the history behind Kepler's laws and a bit about Feynman as a professor and genius. The second half goes more into calculating the formulas and deriving them. It's a great read, but a little technical. I suggest having a pencil and notepad close by for taking notes! "
17,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36960458-a-merlocks,5,"Do you love Physics? Did you love your College classes? If the answer to these two questions is in the affirmative, then this book is for you. It is truly a museum piece in its own right. It includes plenty of technical notes. A must read for those planning a career in academia (the teaching side). "
18,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260303-jeff-brateman,5,"This was awesome. Using no calculus or terribly obtuse math, you see some really important geometrical physics proofs.

27,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22925176-jeroen-bos-mulder,4,"This book is about the lost lecture of Richard Feynman on the motion of the planets around the sun. It is not a book by Feynman but by David and Judith Goodstein.The book contains Feynman’s elementary proof that planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun (being one of the focus points) by first showing that the so-called velocity orbit of each planet is a perfect circle. For this fact he “only” needs the famous laws of Newton and the law of gravity. Elementary, but not simple at all.Feynman's reasoning is based on the work of Sir Isaac Newton, however he deviates at the point where he could not follow the arguments of Newton anymore. Feynman challenged himself in providing a geometric proof in the tradition of the ancient scholars instead of using the nowadays more custom analytical methods. As he states himself his proof is elementary but not simple.The whole idea behind this proof is truly elegant. Instead of focusing on the orbit swiped out by the ""position"" vector - that is the vector spanned by the position of the sun and the position of the planet - he changes the point of view to the derived picture, that is looking at the “velocity” vector, that is the vector given by the absolute velocity and direction of the planet (relative to the sun), and the orbit swept out by these vectors when the planet moves around the sun. My own first guess was that the orbit in this velocity diagram would be similar to the position orbit, but much to my surprise it was even simpler: it turns out to be a circle where the starting position of the velocity vectors is not at the center of the circle, but is off-center.The elegance comes not only from this ""simple"" velocity orbit, but also from the way Feynman proves that it is indeed a circle. His ingredients are the laws of Newton and the fact that gravity depends on the inverse of the squared distance. This latter fact is derived from the third law of Kepler. The first and second law of Kepler are then reconstructed from Newton's laws and geometric arguments. Kepler's second law states that the area swept out by a planet (with respect to the sun) is equal for equal times. This follows directly from geometrical reasoning using Newton's laws. Kepler's first law states that planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits. Feynman uses Newton's laws and the law of gravity to geometrically prove that the velocity orbit is indeed a perfect circle. From this proven fact he then continues to show that the position orbit of the planet is indeed an ellipse, thereby proving the first law of Kepler.The difference between the empirical laws of Kepler, describing the motions of the planet around the sun, and the logical reasoning of Newton (and Feynman) using Newtons famous laws to derive these empirical laws, is interesting in our current time frame, where the question is asked whether AI is capable of logical understanding. Kepler’s laws were based on observations and recognising patterns, but there was no understanding underlying these patterns. Newton managed to start with a few basic assumptions and then derive the laws of Kepler, but also a lot more than this. Feynman ends his lecture using his approach to gain understanding of the structure of atoms and derives the scattering law of Rutherford which was used to prove that matter inside an atom is concentrated at the center of this atom.The Goodsteins describe in great details the story about this lost lecure and how it was recovered and eventually led to this book. They describe how they have reconctructed the line of reasoning of Richard Feynman step by step, filling in the gaps or unclarities of Feynman's lecture notes. Finally they present the original transcript containing the storyline of Feynman himself. Since the proof of Feynman is based on the work of Sir Isaac Newton and the work of Johannes Kepler, the Goodsteins also provide as introduction a brief overview of our understanding of the celestial bodies in our heavens or universe as we would call it by now. It ranges from the work of Plato, Aristotle and Copernicus, to Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei."
28,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104663342-fernando-pestana-da-costa,4,"This book is the french translation of the American original titled Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of the Planets Around the Sun. The transcription of Feynman's lecture of March 13, 1964, is in pages 135-161 (i.e., it uses only 27 of the book 174 plus pages). The rest is made up of chapters about how the book came to be, of the history of planetary physics from Copernic to Newton, and a very detailed and clear explanation of all the minute details of Feynman's exposition, accompanied with about one hundred and fifty diagrams. Feynman's goal was to explain to first year Caltech undergraduates how Kepler's laws could be deduced from Newton's, using only elementary geometric arguments. The deduction of Kepler's equal areas law and the ""b^3 proportional to T^2"" law is taken directly from Newton's Principia, but the deduction, by elementary geometrical means, that the law 1/R^2 for the gravitational force implies the planets' orbits are elliptic is Feynman's and it is truly elegant. It is always a fantastic experience to witness a great mind at work and this is about the best one can get in written form! "
29,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5724695-chayan-ghosh,3,"The entire book could have fit into 30 to 40 pages, accounting for all the diagrams. The reconstruction of Feynman's lecture, even though very thorough, lacked any standard of mathematical proofs. The same statements have been made again and again and even the proofs repeated. And all that did not add any value to the explanation, but only some volume to the book. A better work could have been done using much fewer words."
30,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65288642-jeffrey-sung,5,"It's a pretty cool lecture. Barring his Lectures in Physics, definitely the most technical Feynman-related non-academic publication. As others have mentioned, it's elementary, but not simple. I definitely initially couldn't understand what he was doing until I got older and learned more about how to think, and learned more physics."

Written by the next generation of his admirers, the book gives an insight into the mind of a man obsessed with solving puzzles by employing his own quirky techniques. Part history lesson part celestial mechanics, Feynman uses geometry in much the same manner as Newton to deduce the nature of planetary orbits. The real delight is the audio cd of the actual lecture that accompanies the volume. It is marvelous to hear Richard Feynman's voice in its prime."
34,0393039188,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32005999-lee-belbin,4,"This is a very entertaining introduction to Feynman's approach to physics. Rather than differential equations, he uses simple geometry, as Newton used in the Principia to example Newton's three 'laws'. Feynman uses beautiful reasoning and geometry that a high school student can follow to derrive eliptical orbits (and other conic sections). This took me back 50 years! Pity that in my Kindle version of the book, the diagrams were almost illegible. If you want to read this, do it in a paper version! The book reinforced the beauty of science."
