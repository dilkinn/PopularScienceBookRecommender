It is so boring I fell asleep reading it when I wasn't even tired. 90% of the content is a smug, self-congratulatory ramble about how great lateral thinking is, using different metaphors to explain exactly the same thing. The remaining 10% actually describes ways to use lateral thinking, but the dullest manner imaginable. I know improving your lateral thinking skills requires more effort than solving a few puzzles, but this book fails to engage or inspire you on this quest. I would have given it 1 star, but as I only read half way, I gave it the benefit of the doubt that it would improve. A shame, because I really would like to improve my lateral thinking skills, but this is not the book for me."
1,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1798996-valerie,0,"To me, the crux of this book might be summed up in an epigram that appears in the book. I don't remember it exactly, but the basic premise is that logic can dig a very deep hole--but you won't strike water until you use lateral thinking to decide where to PUT the hole.It reminds me of my experiences with school systems that encourage rote learning. When I first went to such a school, I was extremely impressed by how quickly and thoroughly most of the students were able to memorize things. I've always memorized laboriously, and retained little. I continued being impressed until I brought a problem to some of them. ""Look."" I said ""If you change this, and bring that in, doesn't that imply this result?"" They looked at me as if I were speaking Sanskrit. Further questioning revealed that they had memorized the formulae, and could apply them without difficulty--but they couldn't understand what the formulae MEANT, or how they were arrived at, or could be changed.This book is simply a starter for people who want to LEARN rather than memorize. To use Ms Frizzle's line from The Magic School Bus, ""Take chances. Make mistakes. Get messy."" Once you grasp the principle, the rest of the book is mostly exercises and illustrations. Useful, but you could develop your own--and probably should."

3,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558206-eric,0,"I've always wanted to improve my lateral thinking skills. I guess some childish part of me was hoping for instant gratification, read this book and bing! you're a lateral thinker. Of course not. It's something you need to work on everyday, even for 5 minutes a day (add that to the list of things you should be doing everyday even for five minutes, stretching, meditating, napping, etc). I guess the book was OK, got a little bored wading through the exercises [these are suggestions for a tacher, and not quite optimised for solo work, though you could probably work that out for yourself].The chapter on the word 'Po' infuriated me, I must add. Artificialness of it grated very strongly my nerves, so much so that I wanted to toss the book (library book!) out the bus window.But then he follows up with a very nice chapter on being 'blocked by openness'... having these blind spots that come from your suboptimal solution work.Notes to future eric: difference between vertical (logical) and lateral thinking like difference between depth first and breadth first search? or hill climbing vs mutation? You need both. Clichés are useful. Self-reinforcing patterns and laziness (vertical) are good! You can sit around disrupting all day, otherwise you never get things done... that said, sometimes you do need to shake things up, pop yourself out of a dead-end, and that's where lateral thinking comes in useful. It's not about right or wrong, just about different, generating alternatives. Use vertical thinking later to sift through the crap. Suspending judgment. Hang on to the blocked-by-openness thing.Argh, now I'm frustrated. I wish I could attend a lateral thinking class, or read something not written by De Bono (and not something fluffy-markety either)"
4,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488997-renato-besen,3,"Interesting book, offering some processes to generate ideas and solve problems.To me, the main point of the book is to see problems and solutions as patterns, so after you recognize a pattern you can break/rearrange to form new patterns (or new solutions).The author argues that ideas should not be discarded, no matter how ridiculous they seem. Even the most outrageous ideas can provide insights about a problem. It's not important to be right all along the problem solving process, it's only important to be right at the end."

This is must read for professionals who solves many technical problems day to day and also for college students to have a successful career."
6,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3691534-moayad-taibah,2,"“How do I love thee, let me count the ways”... apparently, there were a lot of ways for this author to explain Lateral Thinking and its techniques over and over and over...and over. I feel if this book was shorter by 100 pages it would’ve delivered the same content, sheesh...Lateral thinking is an alternative way of thinking that leaves some room for incorrect ideas to surface without being judged or shut down before their time. We tend to think in a structured way in order to find the correct path towards the answer. But with lateral thinking, the purpose is finding something interesting and eventually getting to an answer regardless of the path we took to get there.The book is good at explaining what vertical and lateral thinking are and how they differ from each other, and it provides some techniques to facilitate lateral thinking along with practices to actually try out those techniques.Let’s start with the good stuff. I loved the analogies the author made to explain the concept of lateral and vertical thinking, it simplified how the brain processes information and the possible limitations it entails. I also appreciated some of the techniques presented to practice lateral thinking, even though some of them are common sense and we just need to be conscious of them when needed. What I didn’t like was the practices that seemed to be too distant from being practical and for me, it didn’t serve me much other than to actually get a better grasp of the techniques they represent. The other MAJOR disappointment and the main reason this book got a 2 was the amount of redundant information.Overall, I find it quite difficult to recommend this book to anyone with the amount of time you’ll have to waste in order to get to the meat of things, but if you’re working in a creative field I would say let go of your perfectionist and skim through it.Key Takeaways: 1. The way the mind works is by trying to fit pieces of information into an already known pattern thus the order in which you receive information matters and shifts your way of thinking.2. Vertical thinking is focused on what is correct and the best while avoiding making mistakes. Lateral thinking suspends judgment and generative.3. Challenging assumptions can be difficult but it comes with practice, one method that can be applied is the 5 why’s.4. Design is a problem-solving technique that shy’s away from cliches.5. Acknowledging dominant ideas and their boundaries helps in loosening things up and going in a different direction.6. When dealing with concepts and rules reverse and reorder the information to challenge the preconception.7. The usefulness of generated ideas from brainstorming can be immediate (solution), generate new ideas, or for reframing the problem.8. Our perception can be polar (black.vs.white) and tends to categorize things which can be limiting.9. Our perception can be blocked when things are unseen/blocked/adequate (good enough) which stops us from going further and exploring additional solutions."

This was one of the first of Edward De bono's books that I read. Great read. In his efforts to explain complex theorys, he uses insightful abstract comparisons that his theorys have with tangible objects. Love it"

9,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2212975-murray,4,"This book starts with a dilemma faced by a pretty merchant's daughter confronted by her father's nasty creditor. The creditor says he will settle the issue with a game of chance. Where they stand are white and black stones. he will put two stones in a bag and she will draw one out. A white stone means the debt is settled, a black stone means the debt is settled but she must marry the money-lender. Our heroine notices that the money lender puts two black stones in the bag. So whatever she chooses she is in a fix. And if she demonstrates he is cheating then he will just ruin her father. So she . . . uses lateral thinking. (You need to look at the book to see what she does, I won't spoil it.) De Bono likes to point out that this phrase - lateral thinking - was coined by him and is now in the Oxford dictionary. Why he should worry that people do not realise he invented the idea I don't know - his books have allowed him to buy a whole island near Venice apparently, which can't be bad."

It is designed to help teachers but does also give students and beginners plenty of material to work with. My friend who suggested this told me to read it over a few years. And so I did.

13,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18294208-samanta,4,"At school, the emphasis has always been on logical sequential thinking, while creativity is vaguely encouraged but mostly perceived as a mysterious, innate talent. In this book, the author creates a clear distinction between logical and lateral thinking. He emphasises on the importance of lateral thinking in problem solving and in generation of new ideas. The book teaches some practical techniques that can be used in idea generation process and enhance creativity. The most valuable lesson for me personally was the suspension of judgment during the early generative stages of thinking. Favourite quotes from the book: ""Very often you need to break the old pattern which has been useful and arrange the old information in a new way.""""The purpose of lateral thinking is not to be right but to be effective. Being right means being right all the time. Being effective means being right only at the end.""""A wrong idea at some stage can lead to a right later on."" "

15,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19697975-george,4,A great book for introduse yourself in the lateral thinking methods. Quite straightforward and all the techniques are backed up with exercises.
16,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74824794-nikolai-iakimov,4,"I have recently noticed that I started to stumble upon really simple, but still brilliant ideas that can change my life for the better. But I am coming up with those ideas rather accidentally, in a haphazard way. So, I wondered if there's a way to find a distinct pattern, a sort of well-proven technique to pull off ""eurekas"" every single day.In De Bono's ""Serious Creativity"", which I read a couple of weeks ago, the author dwells upon his concept of ""Six thinking hats"" and some other thinking tools, such as random words or images. ""Lateral thinking"" is a somewhat shorter book, and a fair part of it is devoted to that very gimmick of inserting a random word into a thinking equation. At first, it didn't come off as a viable tactic, but I tried it myself and it worked!Other concepts that De Bono extrapolates on are finding the crucial point (e.g., do robots need to have five-fingered hands, like humans? - no, the crucial point is that they simply need enough to hold something firmly); reversal (e.g., does the policeman regulate the traffic flow? - yes, and no, in a way the traffic flow commands his actions) and, probably, the most applicable one - challenging assumptions. Let's say, you need to plant five trees so that each one of them would be at an equal distance from others. Seemingly, this is impossible, but only assuming that they are all on a flat ground. If we break this assumption and imagine the central tree growing on top of a hill or at the bottom of some pit - and it's perfectly feasible!However, just like ""Serious Creativity"", this book lacks real-life examples and contains too much conceptual theorizing instead of practical advice. Above that, it possibly caters more to school and university teachers teaching creativity in classes, than to actual learners of creativity. But if one distills the presented lessons carefully, he can still gain a lot from this book."
17,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74131197-antonia-rapheal,5,"A brilliant book that taught me how to think outside the box. As a child of the 80s education system that was all rote and assembly line methodology. This book really showed me how to step out of that mold and helped me break down the walls that I was so used to. Taught me to think on an infinite plane, it is daunting trust me!"
18,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12374521-jaimin-dave,4,The book is really written using Lateral Thinking. The things explained to explain Lateral Thinking are from so many different things that your mind swings here and there often which gives you headache. Change is painful and to think out of the box is also very tough. Bringing things that are not relevant to the context to think innovative needs practice and Edward De Bono has explained it so well that anybody who reads the book will change the way they think when it's time to think of something new. I would recommend everyone to read Edward De Bono.
19,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4583823-anand,4,"This book ""lateral thinkin'"" was really unusual and evoked new thoughts and new insights in me.But after flippin' few pages I bit felt that points are repeated in different manner.Illustrations provided with diagram are self explanatory.Another con I wud put forward is, this book for most part was crafted for school teachers or group working. Altogether I can call this book good read."

The author Edward de Bono is a pioneer inlateral thinking and brought in new terms like Po into common usage. This book is meant to be read and re read to get its full benefits.

22,0140137793,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277622-kendy-madisha,4,Best book on exploring the way we think.

The purpose of thinking is not to be right but to be effective. what is lateral thinking?Lateral thinking is a process that enables us to restructure our patterns, to open up our mind and avoid thinking in cliched, set ways. It is essentially creativity, but without any mystique. It is simply a way of dealing with information that results in more creative outcomes. what is humour, but the sudden restructuring of existing pattern? If we can introduce the unexpected element, we do not need to slave to these patterns. Techniques of creative thinkers:Most of his book consists of techniques to try to get us into lateral thinking mode. They include:1. Generating alternatives2. challenge assumptions3. Quotas4. Analogies5. Finding the dominant idea6. Reversal thinking7. Brainstorming8. Suspended judgement.One of the points is that lateral thinkers do not feel they have to be ""right"" all the time, only effective. What matters most is generating enough ideas so that some may be wrong, but others turn out right. "

The author has explained the rationale behind irrational thinking and has motivated the readers to develop the habit of lateral thinking. Since it contains hands-on activities, it can be also used as a practical guide by the teachers.What I loved about this book is that it the first book to formally cover the concept of lateral thinking. Sometimes we need to think in weird ways and stop our judgemental action till we reach a point where we can find alternative ways to reach our problem like finding the path from a mesh of paths by starting from the destination and going towards the source. The author has told many ways to develop this habit and has listed the advantages it has including producing the humor. "

You will feel like you are reading an academic paper.I have recently finished the popular TV series called The Good Place. In that show, there's a character called Chidi Anagonye who is an ethics professor but he's also extremely rigid and indecisive. He can never settle on one idea and keeps circling around.This book is like that. It is so bad, I expected to learn something from it, instead it only frustrates you because the writer keeps presenting and explaining an idea, only to dispel them in the next paragraph. A lot like watching Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, he kills off your favourite character the moment you begin liking him/her.Worst self help book ever read!"

I very much enjoyed “The Power of Positive Thinking” so I had an elevated expectation for this book.I went through the first few pages. So far, so good. You get an explanation of what lateral thinking is. I did experience some confusion. Maybe because I have come across to the concept of lateral thinking many years before and not realized what it was.The book includes plenty of assignments, and tips on how a teacher can best train students to use lateral thinking and I would recommend it for those who need to teach the subject.
