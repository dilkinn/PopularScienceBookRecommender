But they are not cuddly, so lets better focus on the ones so large that they can be seen.Understanding living in colder environments will be important for freezing humans and sending them out in million-year arcs to each place in the galaxy, awaking at a moment when the core of humanity they came from might not exist anymore. The adaptations to heat will be important to stay alive in habitats and space stations, because counterintuitively, overheating is one of the worst dangers in the endless, vast space. Nothing with briefly opening an airlock to let fresh vacuum in, overheating is easy, but it´s very difficult to get and stay cool again.One of the most tricky things might be the utilization for humans, because both elephants and mice are mammals, but what works perfectly in one organism, kills the other. Not to speak of how difficult it will get with implementing elements of amphibians, reptiles, insects or even fungi and plants in humans, but bioengineers won´t at least certainly not get bored. I would like to be green because of chlorophyll and have no necessity to eat anymore, just some artificial sunlight and much time is saved.Heinrich is an amazing writer, first working as an entomology professor and then moving towards a wider range of biological topics and interdisciplinary works between different subfields of biology and especially ravens. It must be astonishing to do such work in the frozen winter wonderland and distill the impressions to such inspiring books. Alone in the wilderness and silence without humans for days, weeks or even months, just studying nature, maybe a high-end laptop and a pile of books for the long winter nights, sigh, how marvelous that sounds.It´s a prime example of that we should invest more towards learning from and protecting nature, not just because of bad conscience, altruism and for conservation, but out of pure self-interest, because the options we had are already massively reduced because we have exterminated so many plants and animals that held the key to millions of applications in humans and are now forever lost.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberna...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_..."
1,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Bernd Heinrich isn't a purist. When he takes off to live in the frozen Maine woods for the winter, he might chop wood for heat and cooking but drives into town for a bit of relief every now and again. So reading him is reading a balanced man which is one reason I like his books so much. The main reason though is that these books go into such extreme detail, the absolute minutae of the natural life and explain it in well-written prose and his own pen & ink drawings. His world is one where evolution is beautiful and following the development of the animal life and their adaptions that dovetail into the plants, the weather that year and the seasons overall is wondrous. Something beautiful. He doesn't see a difference between us and the animals, we are all one and go to make this great humming planet of life, Gaia, the earth. *Actually he's not quite the balanced man, apart from being a professor of biology he's was also a champion ultra-marathoner, holder of the American records for running both the 150 miles in 24 hours race and the 100 miles one. I wouldn't think his books appeal to everyone, you have to like reading non-fiction, nature books in particular, but if you do, then I can't think of any writer more enjoyable than Bernd Heinrich."
2,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh,5,"It’s like spending a couple of weeks with Bernd in his isolated cabin in Maine, ungrudgingly shared with deer mice & an assortment of bugs, all part of it. A remarkable man who’s sole purpose is to answer all your questions and while he’s at it renew your sense of wonder in nature’s complexity. If you’ve grown up with brutal winters and are at all tuned into nature you must have questioned how on earth animals survive it…“by defying the odds and the laws of physics and proving that the fabulous is possible”- Why do birds flock and why only come winter?- How do bears, instead of suffering from muscle loss like we would after 6 months of lying around, just wake up, stretch & casually walk up a mountain?- How do tiny fragile birds like chickadee's not freeze at 40 below?- And what about those little red squirrels, are they insane? Why are they running around in subzero temperatures instead of hibernating along with the rest of the squirrel kingdom?Always focusing on cold weather survival mechanisms he covers a lot of territory for such a short book, touching on everything from flying squirrels, bats & butterflies to snakes and turtles. He includes his own illustrations, pencil sketches I believe, a really nice touch.This isn’t dumbed down so be prepared to pay attention. Most of it I got though admittedly he lost me on super-cooling. The memoir of a biologist, the style is concise & factual but with just enough of a lyrical touch to get a feel for him, a quiet understated style that still manages to relay his passion. My 1st Bernd and I want more. Summer World: A Season of Bounty I think next, I intend on reading all his books.“Fine feathery snow crystals drift down. There is not a breath of moving air. The sharp clean smell of this new snow prickles my senses and excites. Within a minute I stand at the edge of the pond feeling peace, and just barely hearing the tinkling of snow crystals falling on my jacket. They amplify the stillness”"
3,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"This great seasonal read carefully pitches science to the level of the layman. Heinrich surveys various strategies animals use for surviving the winter: caching food, huddling together, hibernating or entering torpor, and lowering their body temperature – even to the point where 50% of their body water is ice, as with hibernating frogs. “There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” He was particularly curious to know how kinglets survived in freezing conditions. For this and other investigations, he carried out ever so slightly gruesome experiments that make him sound like a lovably nutty professor:To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked [plucked] kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. … Due to its small size, a kinglet would also cool approximately sixty times faster than a naked 150-pound pig.[Yes, he knows from experience!]To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.Some years ago, I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.Heinrich is an emeritus professor of biology at the University of Vermont and has (or had at the time of this book) a rather primitive cabin in Maine. In many ways his life sounds enviable. His passion for knowledge carries through in his writing. I learned a lot from reading this, and came away with a fresh sense of wonder at how species are adapted to their environments. “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”"
4,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850543-rosalie,3,"This book gave me a new understanding and appreciation of what winter is like for small animals in the Northern hemisphere. There are some truly impressive feats of evolution at work here, and it was cool to learn about that. But Bernd Heinrich's views and methods are sometimes difficult for me to read about. He kills a lot of animals (insects, turtles, birds, rodents) in order to learn about them, and I understand that that is often the cost of knowledge. He just doesn't seem to acknowledge that there's anything morally grey about it, and that was hard to take for an entire book. When discussing the applications of freezing-tolerance research to the field of human cryogenics, he cringes. ""It is pure research, that which has no practical implication whatsoever, that enlivens the human spirit the most,"" he says. So I guess it's OK for him to freeze, thaw, and re-freeze baby turtles until they die, just to satisfy an intellectual itch, but as soon as it could be useful to human society, THAT'S science going to far? It just rubbed me the wrong way."
5,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"There are a ton of nature books these days, written by would-be modern-day Thoreaus and Carsons, people who sell self-congratulatory identity affirmations to environmentalists (sensu lato). Those books take two tacks: sentimental glorification of nature in lush prose, and an issue-specific jeremiad. I have read a ton of both, and I still love some of the best ones an awful lot (Barry Lopez, in the former camp). But after reading those formulas so much, and turning those values over in my head for several years, I am no longer really interested in the politics of nature--at least not the entry-level stuff. So it's rather a relief to find a book of natural history that isn't preoccupied with selling its readers on the value of its subject matter, and that doesn't feel the need to soapbox about environmental crises.Winter World is just Heinrich doing science, observing the forest around his cabin, asking questions, then seeking out existing research and performing experiments to try and answer them. It's a rare book in that it is as much about modeling a lifestyle and a mode of engagement as it is about the didactic fulfillment of curiosity. The closest analogue I've read is Hannah Holmes' Suburban Safari, also a book of natural history anecdotes, questions, and research united only by its theme. Heinrich's prose is simple and serviceable, never overblown and always careful. He doesn't feel the need to provide generalizable take-home answers to any of the questions that might inspire readers to seek out the book. All the answers are context specific and often are simply that ""the answer is context-specific."" How do kinglets make it through the winter? Well, a lot of them don't, but the ones that do achieve it by finding enough caterpillars, flocking with other birds for warmth and information, and never getting caught without decent shelter on the coldest nights. It's a good reminder that, when we ask our questions idly, we tend to oversimplify, satisfying ourselves with conclusions that don't reflect the majority of an organism's circumstances. I am an arrogant boy and I have been learning about this stuff long enough that it took me off guard how many seemingly basic facts of natural history I had either been ignorant of or simply never considered. Birds nests were a minor revelation, a focus on something I'd known in an abstract sense for a while. Kinglets construct nests from moss and spidersilk! There is this whole little economy of discarded body parts, ships made from toenail clippings and houses built from beetle shells and such. Turtles bury themselves in mud and hold their breath all winter! Beavers freeze all their food in a pile under the frozen surface of their pond, just going back and forth from the larder to the dam all winter. They never see the sun, so their circadian rhythms get all screwed up, like college students on holiday vacation. Insects use dozens of means to survive the winter, overwintering as eggs larvae, pupae, or adults, and variously using dehydration, antifreeze and supercooling, controlled freezing, or shelter to avoid death by ice crystal. I'll be looking for overwintering insects in the forest this winter break."
6,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"How do animals survive in the winter? The Arctic ground squirrel hibernates in the winter, and digs himself a small hole and sleeps there for 11 months each year! Its body temperature drops to -2 to -2.9 C, though in the laboratory, its blood plasma freezes at those temperatures! Once a month its body temperature rises to around 30 C for about a day, during which the squirrel experiences REM sleep. Why does its temperature rise, which uses up half of its available fat energy supply?How does the tiny kinglet bird survive in the Arctic, at subfreezing temperatures; where does it find food when the ground is covered with a thick layer of snow? These mysteries and many more are explored in this fascinating book. The book tries to explain many mysteries of evolution, such as why did bird feathers evolve? (Probably as a means for heat insulation, not as a means for flight.)Bernd Heinrich is a wonderful storyteller. His books are highly recommended to anybody interested in biology."
7,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6565403-sacha,3,"As with other books of MR. Heinrich's I have read, this one was very anecdotal. I question his methods and reasoning. Such as the whole business of banging axes on trees to make birds fly in an already calorie stressed environment. Or climbing up a tree and flushing out flying squirrels, then touching them, for the reason only of touching them. I feel like I read the words of a man who has grown enough to learn and know better and yet frequently acts upon the impulses if a small boy. Perhaps there was more scientific process, left out to add to the readability. I hope so."
8,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"A truly fascinating book on nature in our backyard and backwoods. This books deals with the many North American species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and insects that overwinter or hibernate. It is written in a narrative format and very little of the material is dry.My favorite chapters, in no particular order, were those on weasels, flying squirrels, turtles, butterflies, bats, muskrats, and bees. 5 stars. An amazing store of information. "
9,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5616723-jason,2,"OK - this is the 2nd book of Heinrich's I've tried to read - and could just not get through..and it is too bad. I think he is an excellent writer with some great naturalist/scientific knowledge...but I find his behavior described rather scientifically irresponsible. He seems to constantly just grab baby animals from the wild and raise them as pets to learn about. I'm assuming (maybe hopefully) that he has a permit to do this, but he never describes any of that. His writing is too pretty and emotional where I feel some actual scientific information now and then would make things a lot more clear. Oh well."
10,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802351-amanda,2,"2.5 stars. Someday, Goodreads will add half stars.So, I thought this book had a lot of interesting information. While technical and tedious at times, I fully appreciate all of the information here -- there was definitely a ton. Yay science. Animals have some amazing adaptations to get through winter and I learned a lot. I loved the kinglet stuff -- no wonder they were the inspiration for this book.I struggled with the author's overall tone though -- I guess his methods and reasoning. Kidnapping a flying squirrel, ripping food (a duck) out of a snapping turtle's mouth (then depicting it as a monster), keeping a baby snapping turtle to watch it freeze (who knew if that was going to turn out well?), shooting bats with his dad so others could see them and appreciate them ... it all just didn't sit well with me. He seemed kind of cocky and condescending at times, and this whole ""contact encouraged"" philosophy for the sake of just touching things because he felt like it ... eh. It made the book less enjoyable for me.But hey, kinglets are pretty amazing."

12,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"Heinrich begins with an absolutely beautiful chapter that discusses how much energy a body needs to remain active and alive, how much energy the sun provides to Earth's organisms during various seasons, and questions how species can survive when the sun's energy is low. He spends the rest of the book examining the various ways in which all organisms are unquestionably linked to and governed by the planet atop which they live. Many animals have different ways of adapting to low energy and Heinrich gives an extremely thorough explanation of what they are. Very often, he relates it back to humans-- do we have these abilities?, if not, then why?, can we make medical advances by understanding how bears can hibernate for 5 months and not suffer bed sores or bone loss?, and more. Heinrich offers an incredibly thorough survey of the various metabolic processes and physical behaviors at play in species who face cold winter conditions. "
13,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,3,"How do bears, bees, frogs and other creatures stay alive in a barren, subzero landscape? The author uses his experience and research in the New England winter as the backbone of the descriptions of ways creatures stay alive in those cold cold months.Mammals, Birds, Reptiles and insects all have various and special ways of staying alive and passing there genes through another winter.The various survival strategies such as hibernation and nest building-of mammals, birds and reptiles are presented and discussed. He notes how bears endure months of hibernation without losing muscle mass or bone density.He explains how an air-breathing snapping turtle survives six months at the bottom of a frozen pond and how honeybees keep the temperature in their hives at a balmy 36 degrees Celsius no matter how cold it is outside. Most of this is presented with firsthand experience and he usually includes personal stories from the research he did on the subject.As a collection of stories, incidents and anecdotes, this book is very nice. I expected something more structured and whole, and there I was disappointed. Somehow, he jumps from subject to subject, animal to animal up to the stage where you lose the context."
14,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4583352-britta,1,"Am I just a cold-hearted you-know-what for rating this what I did? It seems to have done so well with other readers....??Let me just start with what I *did* like:I love any book about animal adaptations and mutations. (A quirky naturalist is what I like to call myself. Ha!) This book certainly discusses how animals are uniquely suited to cold weather climates (mainly the American northeast) in all sorts of different and fascinating ways. I imagined myself navigating through the winter woods, trudging through deep snow spotting all sorts of wildlife, which has always brought me joy. I also appreciate that the author occasionally gets descriptively poetic with this writing. It kind of reminds me of other naturalists' writing that I enjoy (Thoreau, Berry...) and how I personally feel when I am out communing with nature and also suddenly feel immensely poetic.What I did *not* like is that he seems like a rambling crazy dude pretending to be a naturalist but really just going around and screwing with wildlife. I expected a more concrete, informative discussion of animals' winter adaptations, but the book is more of a glorified nature diary in which Heinrich rambles about his cabins and taking baby animals out of their nests and forcing seeds into roadkill chipmunk cheeks and running over half-dead turtles on the road....So perhaps my main distaste with the book is that for a man who seems interesting in nature and wildlife, he seems to have either an ignorance of or disregard for animals' lives and wellbeing. That truly is what turned me off the most (the number of examples he gives of killing or experimenting with animals is too many for me to count!), but I also expected more real data and fewer observations from a dude who may be spending too much time alone in his cabin. I'm really disappointed that I didn't enjoy this book like, AT ALL. Based upon the title, the description, and the cover art, I was anticipating it becoming one of my new favorites!(For the record, my Mom gave me this book for Christmas so I hope she doesn't read this and get her feelings hurt that I didn't love it as much as we both thought I would. )"
15,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339268-julia,5,"Although I would agree with every other reviewer on this site that ""Winter World"" is a facinating read, accessible to a non-scientist, has gorgeous wildlife sketches by the author, and perfectly compliments a snowy day in my cold weather clime, I would add one other accolade to the pile: it completely changed the way I now look at the wild animals that share this frigid corner of Ohio with me, and made me respect them all the more. They are not beggars that live on the warm-heartedness of humans and our food handouts! They are formidible challengers to the he*l that winter can be here, and their powers of overcoming its hardships have been honed and refined though millions of years of precise evolution. Want to have your mind blown with cold-weather adaptibility? Read the chapter on the hibernation techniques of artic birds, whose very blood has anti-freeze chemicals in it yet unknown to science! You will be facsinated by the author's own dedication to trial, experimentation, and research, and his many talents that made this book possible. Just one caveat: it is a long book, and I have to admit I still have the final chapters to read. But it is also a book that can be picked up and put down (some would say it could ""hibernate"" ha, ha) at will, with very self-contained chapters. This classic will certainly stand the test of time."
16,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2523878-andree-sanborn,5,"I am getting closer to reading all of Heinrich's books. Each book leads me to more photographic quests and more reading from other sources. While reading this on my Kindle, I kept a running list of things to look for in the woods. The priority is Golden-crowned kinglets, a dime-sized bird that often flies with chickadees. I have heard them thousands of times and can easily recognize their calls. But few people have seen them because they are so small and elusive. Winter World describes the natural history of the northern New England winter and discusses food, habitats, life histories and observation techniques for naturalists to learn the interconnections of an ecosystem. The kinglet is the center of the winter world here. We learn about the other animals and plants that it interacts with and wonder about the plants and animals that the bird does not interact with.I won't list my list of quests from this book. It could be boring to someone who does not live here. Instead, I have questions for Heinrich:How do you safely navigates the bog in winter and summer? We can easily go in summer (after the red-winged blackbirds leave), hopping from tussock to tussock and hopefully not landing in mud that sucks off our boots. There are conservation laws here that restrict our access to the bog and we faithfully follow these laws. At times I am baffled at how easily Heinrich negotiates his travels in the bog.The usage of units: in a preface, you specifically mention that you are using Celsius units. That is fine for the entire world. Just not here. Even though I occasionally teach the metric system, I continue to have problems negotiating between our American units and metric units. The book is about our area, so please convert the units to what we are used to. Put the conversions in parentheses, but please put them. In several places, however, you abandon your Celsius units and suddenly only use Fahrenheit. Inconsistent! But at least I know that -40°F=-40°C. That was a huge help during reading, since our temperature can, and have, dipped that low.You write that you have never seen native, non-migratory birds eat winterberries. We have. The turkeys will eat them, leaving huge messes behind as only turkeys can do. Word of mouth here has it that hibernating bears in winter are dangerous. They can easily be woken up, are very grouchy, and often leave their den during sunny winter days to eat. We, and most of the people we know, carry guns in the woods because of the bears and because of other animals that may be dangerous. After reading this book, though, I am wondering if this common lore is correct. You say that bears do not eat at all in the winter, even if they do wake up. And they usually never leave their dens. I will still carry a gun in the winter, though, just in case I fall into a bear's den. Finally, I'd like to quote a paragraph with a great anecdote from page 196 about a mythical village here in the Kingdom: 
There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.
You can't live in the Kingdom without reading this book. Our winters deserve your attention."
17,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23233462-clare-o-beara,5,"This book reads like a companion volume to What Should A Clever Moose Eat? by John Pastor. We wander the north woods in deep winter, observing and studying and carrying out occasional experiments with the author and his students. Just when we think the adaptations of creatures can't get any odder, they do. Rabbits burrow into the subnivian or under snow layer, tunnelling happily between trees to eat the bark off right up to the snow crust and invisible to predators. Colour-changing creatures turn white in a space of a week or two. Caterpillars thaw to eat for a brief summer, freeze, thaw again and eat, for a dozen or more years before reaching the size needed to pupate. Birds appear to die but can be thawed. Other birds huddle and shiver nightly, burning fat which they must replenish by day. Flying squirrels huddle in hollow trees to share warmth. Beaver lodges provide safe havens and larders. Bears sleep with lowered metabolic rates, giving birth to cubs which they suckle for three months under the snow before awakening in spring. Insects make communal nests or migrate thousands of miles. The hibernate or migrate option has had to be explored by every species. Frogs don't have this option, so they freeze solid. The measurements given are astounding.As this book is specific to the North American area there are differences to European wildlife; what the author calls kinglets are goldcrests to us while he sees witch hazel flowering in early winter to attract late flying insects and I would see it in early spring. I do not always agree with the author's methods. His father shot and stuffed a wide collection of birds. This has informed his behaviour so he thinks nothing of shooting a bird in winter to see what it was eating. I would contrast this with the studies of penguins depicted in The Ferocious Summer by Meredith Hooper. Penguins clambering out of the Antarctic sea were caught and briefly handled to remove the food from their guts, then released. Here the scientists were acutely aware that the penguin colony was endangered and adults were trying to feed their chicks. Heinrich and students bang on snowy trees with axes in the evening to count birds flying out - with seemingly no thought for how the birds would survive the night lacking safe shelter. He tells us that eighty percent of the kinglets he admires die over winter, which doesn't stop him from killing a few more to examine instead of netting and releasing. I would have liked to see discussion of how climate change is affecting the areas studied, and how animals will be affected, but this was written thirteen years ago and much warming has occurred since. Warming is occurring more strongly at higher latitudes. We'll probably see the author revisiting the situation in a later book. Those interested could read Future Arctic by Edward Struzik, a comprehensive look at the top of the globe by scientists ranging from ecologists to fire scientists. But if a window on overwintering plants and animals in extreme conditions is what you want, this easily readable book Winter World can hardly be bettered. "
18,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/927041-jen,3,"This was truly what I'd call weird science. While it was fascinating at times, the author is just plain weird. In one moment, he's quoting fascinating scientific studies while explaining the biology of how frogs survive freezing in winter, and in the next he's calmly explaining that he determined the capacity of seeds that can fit into a chipmunk's mouth (how else?) by stuffing the cheek pouches of a roadkill chipmunk until they were completely full, then counting the seeds. Yep, because that's TOTALLY something a normal person would do. Also, it seems completely logical that to determine where red squirrels sleep at night in the winter, you should track 2-3 of them to a stump, then get a giant group of your friends over with some axes and shovels, and dig out said stump until squirrels go racing in panic out the exit holes. That sure did solve that mystery! Don't worry, I'm sure the squirrels went to Motel 6 for the night after you HACKED APART their home for science. This guy is also at least 95% too obsessed with ruby crowned kinglets. I'm a bit lost as to why this author has been recommended to me strongly by so many people.... he's just a bit of an oddball. Interesting enough book, but odd author for sure. "
19,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"I love how this writer frames scientific questions like a mystery... and then proceeds upon a path of clues to get to a final answer. There are even mysteries within the mystery. He starts with a question of: How do Golden-Crowned Kinglets survive winter? And then proceeds to explore how many other animals do it, eliminating possibilities as he goes along, but defining the problem in in quite high resolution as he does.I also really appreciated the discussions of metabolism as they apply to human ageing, and knowledge of torpor/low temperature tolerance could have application in cryonics or space travel.And with that, I think I shall conclude my 2018 reading challenge - breaking even with my 2017 book count of 30."

The flow of the book got bogged down by just too many tiny little details and his interactions with wildlife, especially in the second half of the book, were too disruptive. I did love the sketches throughout the book, and I enjoyed learning about various animals (chickadees are one of my favorites), but overall it just didn't work for me. The lack of an index in the back of the book was also a negative- it would have been nice to look up specific flora and fauna to see what he had to say about them. I'm really surprised at how this book turned out for me- I had been really excited to read it. I'll mark it as three stars because of the parts I enjoyed, but it's really a 2.5 star book for me."

27,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/891651-karen,2,"I feel bad rating as 2 stars a book I didn't really like for the reason that it's not the type of book that I like, but whatever. I found it ""OK"" and Goodreads says if I only thought it was OK then it gets 2 stars from me. If you loved this book I would never fight you over it.Long Story Short: This is probably a wonderful book that was just not for me, at least not for me during this particular January, when I was expecting I’d have some cozy dark-early winter times and got instead 80-degree weather with trips to the jacuzzi. I didn’t finish it. Why I Chose This Book: A biologist friend recommended this book to me, and had said he’d found it very inspiring. What with winter coming up, and me always looking for recommendations from real people, I thought it would be the perfect thing for the season. It was not.The Book’s Strengths: This was a book with a strong voice, told with great detail about a fascinating subject. It was almost a memoir, I thought, and the author had great passion for the subject, as well as a careful and thorough approach to the various explorations of how tiny little animals (and bigger animals) survived during the harsh winters of northern climates. It was peppered with pencil drawings from the author’s own notes, and it was full of interesting observations about the world, and I liked many of the connections the author drew between seemingly disparate things. I mean, I know we use trees for fuel and animals eat other animals, but I never explicitly thought about trees as solar energy containers or rabbits harnessing the sun’s energy for the benefit of the foxes, that kind of thing. (The author said it better, but the book went back to the library weeks and weeks ago.) The author lymoved between loving the natural world and conducting actual experiments about the natural world (like measuring the temperature of bird corpses to see how long they’d hold heat with that shape and that size in frozen temperatures, or sticking his head into tree trunks to measure the amount of squirrel droppings in order to estimate the number of animals using a shelter), with highly readable and almost poetic prose.The Book’s Weaknesses: I am going to fudge on this section, because I can’t really say that the things I didn’t like were weaknesses. I just prefer not to read books that have these things in them. I don’t as a rule read memoirs, because I don’t care that much about people’s introspections on their own lives, and although this book was not a memoir it had an awful lot of “I” in it. I just do not care that much about this guy’s feelings about the natural world. I care much more about the natural world itself, except that I don’t care enough about it, I guess, to learn about the guy while I’m learning about the world. I disliked Thoreau’s Walden for much of the same reason. I would have been happier with a different book about the exact same topic, but I realize that’s not an actual weakness, and I understand that I am dismissing a book because it’s not what I prefer and not for any objective reason. But I just got tired of him.The marketing text for the book includes this sentence: “Biologist, illustrator, and award-winning author Bernd Heinrich explores his local woods, where he delights in the seemingly infinite feats of animal inventiveness he discovers there.”I’m sure I would delight in these things myself if I were reading about them directly. But I didn’t delight in reading about the author’s delight. Does that make sense? What Should Have Happened: I should have read a different book that matched my preferences, I guess. I don’t really have a recommendation here.Short Story Shorter: I don’t like my non-fiction mixed up with memoir. Maybe you do."
28,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40012758-s-e-a-n,0,"This is the third of Heinrich's books that I've read, and so far it's been the least appealing. Now at the halfway point I'm bailing on it. Heinrich is always inching along a fine line between engaging narrative nonfiction and dry scientific observation. He writes memoir well, but can't help himself from slipping into highly technical description. This book teeters a little too often into that field of prose, and so the contrast with the more memoirish sections engenders a disjointed read. Mind of the Raven also frequently crosses this line, but I tolerated it due to my fascination with ravens. While I find it interesting to discover the different techniques animals use to stay warm in the frigid North, it's not compelling enough to keep my interest for 350 pages. Heinrich is also particularly repetitive in this book. It makes me wonder if his editor(s) also glazed over while reading the drier sections, thus allowing large swaths of similarly worded prose to slip through into the final manuscript. Finally, his approach to interference with nature in the name of scientific inquiry strikes me as rather idiosyncratic. For example, he shoots a few Golden-crowned Kinglets, a bird he is obsessed with, in order to discover their stomach contents, yet he is absurdly determined to rescue a single mallard by detaching a snapping turtle's jaws from around the duck's foot. Certainly we all have our individual moral codes, but this book in particular underlines Heinrich's tendencies to treat the entire natural world as his personal laboratory. I find these tendencies distasteful, which explains in part why I abandoned Wildlife Science in favor of an English degree. I'd much rather walk in the woods watching birds than shoot them and dissect their stomachs."
29,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289935-melissa,4,"I've read this in bits and pieces over the past few (winter) months, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Though it is pretty technical and scientific in parts, the overall feel is one of poetic marvel at the strength and ingenuity of these animals, who survive despite all odds through harsh winter conditions. I especially enjoyed the chapters on kinglets, honeybees, turtles, and bats and butterflies. I plan to read the summer companion to this book!My only quibble with this book was the huge amount of typos in the edition I read--not the fault of the author, but annoying all the same!"
30,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5778181-burd,4,"This book brought me back to my childhood. I was a science nerd from a very young age and at one time I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals so much. Things didn't quite work out that way. I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "
31,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"I have had this book on my shelf for a few years. Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter. A perfect winter read. RECOMMENDED!"
32,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"What do I think? Very generous of Bernd Heinrich to share his knowledge through this book. I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"". Amen!"
33,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627603-patti,5,"This book was fascinating all the way through. The individual adaptions each species makes to survive are truly amazing. The students that Professor Heinrich teaches a The University of Vermont are truly lucky. After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "
34,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,4,"I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I purchased this book several months ago, but decided to wait until winter to read it so that it would line up seasonally and perhaps I could observe some of the animals I'd be reading about. I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein. These stories are all told by a very enthusiastic author, creating an enjoyable seasonal read."
35,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544632-stasia,4,"Animals are amazing! And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself. I totally recommend this book. "
36,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4742865-ellen,3,"I learned a great deal about animals in winter. Most of it was facinating. The author vacilated between storyteller and scientist. I had trouble with the scientific portions as my background is college level general biology from 40 years ago. The storyteller made up for the science that bogged down my reading. Learning about the changes that different animals go through in winter to cope with the cold weather just so they can survive to reproduce again was facinating. And how scientists and amateure scienctists discovered how some animals cope was equally amazing. Heinrich kept me reading through (and sometimes over) the detailed science because I knew there was understandable, and at times beautifully written passages just ahead."

I am not very knowledgable about science, but I love the things I am learning from this author about how animals survive in the winter. Things I always wondered about... There are helpful, beautiful drawings in the book too. Anyone who wants to be more in-touch with nature and the creatures who live in the woods will find this book interesting. It is well written, and also would be of interest to teens who have a love of nature."
38,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2818982-christopher,4,"A fine book... very detailed, carefully written, and full of intriguing images and nuggets of information. I admire the extensive efforts of study, observation, and organization that Heinrich demonstrates in his exploration of the ""winter world"" in Vermont and Maine. I'm challenged to cultivate my own analogous level of careful attention to the complexity of nature, though I do now find myself increasingly mindful of New England's many creatures when I'm out running and walking in the snow.

42,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11858843-andrew,4,"Heinrich, biology Professor, writes an excellent book on animal survival in winter conditions. The book is accessible and intriguing. The author walks through many different experiments from freezing frogs, caterpillars, birds and more. Many of these animals have natural mechanisms to deal with freezing temperatures. Heinrich also discusses different strategies animals use for surviving the winter including hibernation, torpor and raising body temperature.  His passion was evident in his writing. Definitely one of the best animal biology books I've read. I put a list of interesting parts of the book into the spoiler section: (view spoiler)[Heinrich explores how animals survived in freezing conditions.  “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”“There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"
43,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"I have some seriously mixed feelings about this guy. On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.  (hide spoiler)]I don't know if Heinrich intended to emphasize cuteness in this book, or if he's just more interested in the adaptive behaviors of wildlife against stress than the stress itself. Maybe I'm just reading these behaviors as ""cute"" because of my own animal prejudices.

Unlike most of the others recommended, this one did not resonate much with me.Heinrich is an interesting chap. He is INTO nature. That's cool. But he's perhaps too into it . . . at least for my tastes. I really don't need to know you conduct experiments where you measure a bees excrement. Just not my thing!And that is what this book was. Oh, no, not all poop, but a lot of minutia about animals that I wasn't particularly interested in. How many different squirrels were described? I'm sure squirrels care about the differences and it is apparent Heinrich does as well. Me? Not so much.One theme through the book that did catch my attention was how animals conserve energy. When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to. I thought at a couple different points that if this had been a National Geographic special instead, I would have been into it. All the same information could have been presented but with the accompanying visuals, I think I would have been hooked enough to care. Yeah, yeah, I know."
47,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice,4,"Bernd Heinrich grew up in western Maine, and spent his boyhood tromping through the woods, as he says, not just in summer, but in the bitter cold of winter. Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

How bizarre is that? Nature and the universe is truly stranger than we might ever mentally ponder even in our wildest fits of imaginative creativity.Heinrich is that wonderful combination of first rate scientist, skilled outdoorsman and superb writer whose talent makes his science and his passion accessible to those of us less knowledgeable in the field.

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

The one I read was a library book, but I bought my own copy after reading because Im sure I will want to reread. I loved the way the author, who is also a professor, describes the way questions of animal behavior arose out of his observations of the wildlife around his home and cabin, and he then proceeded to investigate to find the answers to his questions. The author also includes information on the sources for many of the facts he puts forward right into the text of the book. I liked this aspect of his writing as well. "

I was a science nerd from a very young age and at one time I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals so much. Things didn't quite work out that way. I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "
61,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"I have had this book on my shelf for a few years. Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter. A perfect winter read. RECOMMENDED!"
62,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"What do I think? Very generous of Bernd Heinrich to share his knowledge through this book. I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"". Amen!"
63,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627603-patti,5,"This book was fascinating all the way through. The individual adaptions each species makes to survive are truly amazing. The students that Professor Heinrich teaches a The University of Vermont are truly lucky. After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "
64,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,4,"I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I purchased this book several months ago, but decided to wait until winter to read it so that it would line up seasonally and perhaps I could observe some of the animals I'd be reading about. I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein. These stories are all told by a very enthusiastic author, creating an enjoyable seasonal read."
65,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544632-stasia,4,"Animals are amazing! And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself. I totally recommend this book. "
66,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4742865-ellen,3,"I learned a great deal about animals in winter. Most of it was facinating. The author vacilated between storyteller and scientist. I had trouble with the scientific portions as my background is college level general biology from 40 years ago. The storyteller made up for the science that bogged down my reading. Learning about the changes that different animals go through in winter to cope with the cold weather just so they can survive to reproduce again was facinating. And how scientists and amateure scienctists discovered how some animals cope was equally amazing. Heinrich kept me reading through (and sometimes over) the detailed science because I knew there was understandable, and at times beautifully written passages just ahead."

72,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11858843-andrew,4,"Heinrich, biology Professor, writes an excellent book on animal survival in winter conditions. The book is accessible and intriguing. The author walks through many different experiments from freezing frogs, caterpillars, birds and more. Many of these animals have natural mechanisms to deal with freezing temperatures. Heinrich also discusses different strategies animals use for surviving the winter including hibernation, torpor and raising body temperature.  His passion was evident in his writing. Definitely one of the best animal biology books I've read. I put a list of interesting parts of the book into the spoiler section: (view spoiler)[Heinrich explores how animals survived in freezing conditions.  “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”“There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"
73,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"I have some seriously mixed feelings about this guy. On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.

Unlike most of the others recommended, this one did not resonate much with me.Heinrich is an interesting chap. He is INTO nature. That's cool. But he's perhaps too into it . . . at least for my tastes. I really don't need to know you conduct experiments where you measure a bees excrement. Just not my thing!And that is what this book was. Oh, no, not all poop, but a lot of minutia about animals that I wasn't particularly interested in. How many different squirrels were described? I'm sure squirrels care about the differences and it is apparent Heinrich does as well. Me? Not so much.One theme through the book that did catch my attention was how animals conserve energy. When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to. I thought at a couple different points that if this had been a National Geographic special instead, I would have been into it. All the same information could have been presented but with the accompanying visuals, I think I would have been hooked enough to care. Yeah, yeah, I know."
77,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice,4,"Bernd Heinrich grew up in western Maine, and spent his boyhood tromping through the woods, as he says, not just in summer, but in the bitter cold of winter. Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

How bizarre is that?

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "

Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter. A perfect winter read. RECOMMENDED!"

I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"". Amen!"

The students that Professor Heinrich teaches a The University of Vermont are truly lucky. After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "
94,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,4,"I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I purchased this book several months ago, but decided to wait until winter to read it so that it would line up seasonally and perhaps I could observe some of the animals I'd be reading about. I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein. These stories are all told by a very enthusiastic author, creating an enjoyable seasonal read."
95,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544632-stasia,4,"Animals are amazing! And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself. I totally recommend this book. "
96,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4742865-ellen,3,"I learned a great deal about animals in winter. Most of it was facinating. The author vacilated between storyteller and scientist. I had trouble with the scientific portions as my background is college level general biology from 40 years ago. The storyteller made up for the science that bogged down my reading. Learning about the changes that different animals go through in winter to cope with the cold weather just so they can survive to reproduce again was facinating. And how scientists and amateure scienctists discovered how some animals cope was equally amazing. Heinrich kept me reading through (and sometimes over) the detailed science because I knew there was understandable, and at times beautifully written passages just ahead."

I am not very knowledgable about science, but I love the things I am learning from this author about how animals survive in the winter. Things I always wondered about... There are helpful, beautiful drawings in the book too. Anyone who wants to be more in-touch with nature and the creatures who live in the woods will find this book interesting.

I'm challenged to cultivate my own analogous level of careful attention to the complexity of nature, though I do now find myself increasingly mindful of New England's many creatures when I'm out running and walking in the snow.

102,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11858843-andrew,4,"Heinrich, biology Professor, writes an excellent book on animal survival in winter conditions. The book is accessible and intriguing. The author walks through many different experiments from freezing frogs, caterpillars, birds and more. Many of these animals have natural mechanisms to deal with freezing temperatures. Heinrich also discusses different strategies animals use for surviving the winter including hibernation, torpor and raising body temperature.  His passion was evident in his writing. Definitely one of the best animal biology books I've read. I put a list of interesting parts of the book into the spoiler section: (view spoiler)[Heinrich explores how animals survived in freezing conditions.  “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”“There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"
103,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"I have some seriously mixed feelings about this guy. On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.  (hide spoiler)]I don't know if Heinrich intended to emphasize cuteness in this book, or if he's just more interested in the adaptive behaviors of wildlife against stress than the stress itself. Maybe I'm just reading these behaviors as ""cute"" because of my own animal prejudices. Regardless, ""Winter World"" is a book that will change the way you see the way that you see winter survival, both cuter and scarier than you imagined."

Unlike most of the others recommended, this one did not resonate much with me.Heinrich is an interesting chap. He is INTO nature. That's cool. But he's perhaps too into it . . . at least for my tastes. I really don't need to know you conduct experiments where you measure a bees excrement. Just not my thing!And that is what this book was. Oh, no, not all poop, but a lot of minutia about animals that I wasn't particularly interested in. How many different squirrels were described? I'm sure squirrels care about the differences and it is apparent Heinrich does as well. Me? Not so much.One theme through the book that did catch my attention was how animals conserve energy. When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to. I thought at a couple different points that if this had been a National Geographic special instead, I would have been into it. All the same information could have been presented but with the accompanying visuals, I think I would have been hooked enough to care. Yeah, yeah, I know."
107,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice,4,"Bernd Heinrich grew up in western Maine, and spent his boyhood tromping through the woods, as he says, not just in summer, but in the bitter cold of winter. Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

From the obvious means of hibernation by bears and chipmunks, through the use of torpidity and intense shivering to control body heat in the presence of low external temperatures, to the wood frog which under certain conditions can survive being frozen completely solid! How bizarre is that? Nature and the universe is truly stranger than we might ever mentally ponder even in our wildest fits of imaginative creativity.Heinrich is that wonderful combination of first rate scientist, skilled outdoorsman and superb writer whose talent makes his science and his passion accessible to those of us less knowledgeable in the field.

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

I loved the way the author, who is also a professor, describes the way questions of animal behavior arose out of his observations of the wildlife around his home and cabin, and he then proceeded to investigate to find the answers to his questions. The author also includes information on the sources for many of the facts he puts forward right into the text of the book. I liked this aspect of his writing as well. "

I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well.

After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "

I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein.

And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself.

I had trouble with the scientific portions as my background is college level general biology from 40 years ago. The storyteller made up for the science that bogged down my reading. Learning about the changes that different animals go through in winter to cope with the cold weather just so they can survive to reproduce again was facinating.

132,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11858843-andrew,4,"Heinrich, biology Professor, writes an excellent book on animal survival in winter conditions. The book is accessible and intriguing. The author walks through many different experiments from freezing frogs, caterpillars, birds and more. Many of these animals have natural mechanisms to deal with freezing temperatures. Heinrich also discusses different strategies animals use for surviving the winter including hibernation, torpor and raising body temperature.  His passion was evident in his writing. Definitely one of the best animal biology books I've read. I put a list of interesting parts of the book into the spoiler section: (view spoiler)[Heinrich explores how animals survived in freezing conditions.  “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”“There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"
133,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"I have some seriously mixed feelings about this guy. On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.  (hide spoiler)]I don't know if Heinrich intended to emphasize cuteness in this book, or if he's just more interested in the adaptive behaviors of wildlife against stress than the stress itself.

Unlike most of the others recommended, this one did not resonate much with me.Heinrich is an interesting chap. He is INTO nature. That's cool. But he's perhaps too into it . . . at least for my tastes. I really don't need to know you conduct experiments where you measure a bees excrement. Just not my thing!And that is what this book was. Oh, no, not all poop, but a lot of minutia about animals that I wasn't particularly interested in. How many different squirrels were described? I'm sure squirrels care about the differences and it is apparent Heinrich does as well. Me? Not so much.One theme through the book that did catch my attention was how animals conserve energy. When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to. I thought at a couple different points that if this had been a National Geographic special instead, I would have been into it. All the same information could have been presented but with the accompanying visuals, I think I would have been hooked enough to care. Yeah, yeah, I know."

Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

How bizarre is that?

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

I was a science nerd from a very young age and at one time I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals so much. Things didn't quite work out that way. I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "

Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter.

I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"".

162,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11858843-andrew,4,"Heinrich, biology Professor, writes an excellent book on animal survival in winter conditions. The book is accessible and intriguing. The author walks through many different experiments from freezing frogs, caterpillars, birds and more. Many of these animals have natural mechanisms to deal with freezing temperatures. Heinrich also discusses different strategies animals use for surviving the winter including hibernation, torpor and raising body temperature.  His passion was evident in his writing. Definitely one of the best animal biology books I've read. I put a list of interesting parts of the book into the spoiler section: (view spoiler)[Heinrich explores how animals survived in freezing conditions.  “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”“There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"
163,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"I have some seriously mixed feelings about this guy. On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.  (hide spoiler)]I don't know if Heinrich intended to emphasize cuteness in this book, or if he's just more interested in the adaptive behaviors of wildlife against stress than the stress itself. Maybe I'm just reading these behaviors as ""cute"" because of my own animal prejudices. Regardless, ""Winter World"" is a book that will change the way you see the way that you see winter survival, both cuter and scarier than you imagined."

Unlike most of the others recommended, this one did not resonate much with me.Heinrich is an interesting chap. He is INTO nature. That's cool. But he's perhaps too into it . . . at least for my tastes. I really don't need to know you conduct experiments where you measure a bees excrement. Just not my thing!And that is what this book was. Oh, no, not all poop, but a lot of minutia about animals that I wasn't particularly interested in. How many different squirrels were described? I'm sure squirrels care about the differences and it is apparent Heinrich does as well. Me? Not so much.One theme through the book that did catch my attention was how animals conserve energy. When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to. I thought at a couple different points that if this had been a National Geographic special instead, I would have been into it. All the same information could have been presented but with the accompanying visuals, I think I would have been hooked enough to care. Yeah, yeah, I know."
167,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice,4,"Bernd Heinrich grew up in western Maine, and spent his boyhood tromping through the woods, as he says, not just in summer, but in the bitter cold of winter. Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

168,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,4,"The wonders of evolutionWINTER WORLD provides an overview of the amazing evolutionary adaptations in both physiology and behaviour that the members of the animal kingdom have made to ensure their survival through bitter northern winters. From the obvious means of hibernation by bears and chipmunks, through the use of torpidity and intense shivering to control body heat in the presence of low external temperatures, to the wood frog which under certain conditions can survive being frozen completely solid! How bizarre is that? Nature and the universe is truly stranger than we might ever mentally ponder even in our wildest fits of imaginative creativity.Heinrich is that wonderful combination of first rate scientist, skilled outdoorsman and superb writer whose talent makes his science and his passion accessible to those of us less knowledgeable in the field. Heinrich's obvious delight in sharing his discoveries makes the reading of WINTER WORLD at once informative, charming and exciting.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

The one I read was a library book, but I bought my own copy after reading because Im sure I will want to reread. I loved the way the author, who is also a professor, describes the way questions of animal behavior arose out of his observations of the wildlife around his home and cabin, and he then proceeded to investigate to find the answers to his questions. The author also includes information on the sources for many of the facts he puts forward right into the text of the book. I liked this aspect of his writing as well. "

180,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5778181-burd,4,"This book brought me back to my childhood. I was a science nerd from a very young age and at one time I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals so much. Things didn't quite work out that way. I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "
181,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"I have had this book on my shelf for a few years. Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter. A perfect winter read. RECOMMENDED!"
182,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"What do I think? Very generous of Bernd Heinrich to share his knowledge through this book. I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"". Amen!"

The students that Professor Heinrich teaches a The University of Vermont are truly lucky. After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "
184,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,4,"I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I purchased this book several months ago, but decided to wait until winter to read it so that it would line up seasonally and perhaps I could observe some of the animals I'd be reading about. I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein. These stories are all told by a very enthusiastic author, creating an enjoyable seasonal read."
185,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544632-stasia,4,"Animals are amazing! And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself. I totally recommend this book. "

It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"

On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.  (hide spoiler)]I don't know if Heinrich intended to emphasize cuteness in this book, or if he's just more interested in the adaptive behaviors of wildlife against stress than the stress itself. Maybe I'm just reading these behaviors as ""cute"" because of my own animal prejudices. Regardless, ""Winter World"" is a book that will change the way you see the way that you see winter survival, both cuter and scarier than you imagined."

Unlike most of the others recommended, this one did not resonate much with me.Heinrich is an interesting chap. He is INTO nature. That's cool. But he's perhaps too into it . . . at least for my tastes. I really don't need to know you conduct experiments where you measure a bees excrement. Just not my thing!And that is what this book was. Oh, no, not all poop, but a lot of minutia about animals that I wasn't particularly interested in. How many different squirrels were described? I'm sure squirrels care about the differences and it is apparent Heinrich does as well. Me? Not so much.One theme through the book that did catch my attention was how animals conserve energy. When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to. I thought at a couple different points that if this had been a National Geographic special instead, I would have been into it. All the same information could have been presented but with the accompanying visuals, I think I would have been hooked enough to care. Yeah, yeah, I know."
197,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice,4,"Bernd Heinrich grew up in western Maine, and spent his boyhood tromping through the woods, as he says, not just in summer, but in the bitter cold of winter. Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

198,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,4,"The wonders of evolutionWINTER WORLD provides an overview of the amazing evolutionary adaptations in both physiology and behaviour that the members of the animal kingdom have made to ensure their survival through bitter northern winters. From the obvious means of hibernation by bears and chipmunks, through the use of torpidity and intense shivering to control body heat in the presence of low external temperatures, to the wood frog which under certain conditions can survive being frozen completely solid! How bizarre is that? Nature and the universe is truly stranger than we might ever mentally ponder even in our wildest fits of imaginative creativity.Heinrich is that wonderful combination of first rate scientist, skilled outdoorsman and superb writer whose talent makes his science and his passion accessible to those of us less knowledgeable in the field. Heinrich's obvious delight in sharing his discoveries makes the reading of WINTER WORLD at once informative, charming and exciting.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."
200,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16105107-fadillah,5,"This is interesting and informative reading for animal enthusiasts. The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."
201,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858276-bah-humpug,2,"I found this to be all over the place, jumping from topic to topic and interspersed with numerous anecdotal accounts that I found more boring than the actual detailed scientific parts. And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

The one I read was a library book, but I bought my own copy after reading because Im sure I will want to reread. I loved the way the author, who is also a professor, describes the way questions of animal behavior arose out of his observations of the wildlife around his home and cabin, and he then proceeded to investigate to find the answers to his questions. The author also includes information on the sources for many of the facts he puts forward right into the text of the book. I liked this aspect of his writing as well. "

210,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5778181-burd,4,"This book brought me back to my childhood. I was a science nerd from a very young age and at one time I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals so much. Things didn't quite work out that way. I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "
211,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"I have had this book on my shelf for a few years. Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter. A perfect winter read. RECOMMENDED!"
212,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"What do I think? Very generous of Bernd Heinrich to share his knowledge through this book. I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"". Amen!"
213,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627603-patti,5,"This book was fascinating all the way through. The individual adaptions each species makes to survive are truly amazing. The students that Professor Heinrich teaches a The University of Vermont are truly lucky. After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "
214,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,4,"I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I purchased this book several months ago, but decided to wait until winter to read it so that it would line up seasonally and perhaps I could observe some of the animals I'd be reading about. I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein. These stories are all told by a very enthusiastic author, creating an enjoyable seasonal read."
215,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544632-stasia,4,"Animals are amazing! And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself. I totally recommend this book. "
216,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4742865-ellen,3,"I learned a great deal about animals in winter. Most of it was facinating. The author vacilated between storyteller and scientist. I had trouble with the scientific portions as my background is college level general biology from 40 years ago. The storyteller made up for the science that bogged down my reading. Learning about the changes that different animals go through in winter to cope with the cold weather just so they can survive to reproduce again was facinating. And how scientists and amateure scienctists discovered how some animals cope was equally amazing. Heinrich kept me reading through (and sometimes over) the detailed science because I knew there was understandable, and at times beautifully written passages just ahead."

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.  (hide spoiler)]I don't know if Heinrich intended to emphasize cuteness in this book, or if he's just more interested in the adaptive behaviors of wildlife against stress than the stress itself.

Unlike most of the others recommended, this one did not resonate much with me.Heinrich is an interesting chap. He is INTO nature. That's cool. But he's perhaps too into it . . . at least for my tastes. I really don't need to know you conduct experiments where you measure a bees excrement. Just not my thing!And that is what this book was. Oh, no, not all poop, but a lot of minutia about animals that I wasn't particularly interested in. How many different squirrels were described? I'm sure squirrels care about the differences and it is apparent Heinrich does as well. Me? Not so much.One theme through the book that did catch my attention was how animals conserve energy. When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to. I thought at a couple different points that if this had been a National Geographic special instead, I would have been into it. All the same information could have been presented but with the accompanying visuals, I think I would have been hooked enough to care. Yeah, yeah, I know."

Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

From the obvious means of hibernation by bears and chipmunks, through the use of torpidity and intense shivering to control body heat in the presence of low external temperatures, to the wood frog which under certain conditions can survive being frozen completely solid! How bizarre is that? Nature and the universe is truly stranger than we might ever mentally ponder even in our wildest fits of imaginative creativity.Heinrich is that wonderful combination of first rate scientist, skilled outdoorsman and superb writer whose talent makes his science and his passion accessible to those of us less knowledgeable in the field. Heinrich's obvious delight in sharing his discoveries makes the reading of WINTER WORLD at once informative, charming and exciting.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

The one I read was a library book, but I bought my own copy after reading because Im sure I will want to reread. I loved the way the author, who is also a professor, describes the way questions of animal behavior arose out of his observations of the wildlife around his home and cabin, and he then proceeded to investigate to find the answers to his questions. The author also includes information on the sources for many of the facts he puts forward right into the text of the book. I liked this aspect of his writing as well. "

240,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5778181-burd,4,"This book brought me back to my childhood. I was a science nerd from a very young age and at one time I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals so much. Things didn't quite work out that way. I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "
241,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"I have had this book on my shelf for a few years. Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter. A perfect winter read. RECOMMENDED!"
242,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"What do I think? Very generous of Bernd Heinrich to share his knowledge through this book. I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"". Amen!"
243,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627603-patti,5,"This book was fascinating all the way through. The individual adaptions each species makes to survive are truly amazing. The students that Professor Heinrich teaches a The University of Vermont are truly lucky. After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "
244,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,4,"I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I purchased this book several months ago, but decided to wait until winter to read it so that it would line up seasonally and perhaps I could observe some of the animals I'd be reading about. I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein. These stories are all told by a very enthusiastic author, creating an enjoyable seasonal read."
245,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544632-stasia,4,"Animals are amazing! And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself. I totally recommend this book. "
246,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4742865-ellen,3,"I learned a great deal about animals in winter. Most of it was facinating. The author vacilated between storyteller and scientist. I had trouble with the scientific portions as my background is college level general biology from 40 years ago. The storyteller made up for the science that bogged down my reading. Learning about the changes that different animals go through in winter to cope with the cold weather just so they can survive to reproduce again was facinating. And how scientists and amateure scienctists discovered how some animals cope was equally amazing. Heinrich kept me reading through (and sometimes over) the detailed science because I knew there was understandable, and at times beautifully written passages just ahead."

The author walks through many different experiments from freezing frogs, caterpillars, birds and more. Many of these animals have natural mechanisms to deal with freezing temperatures. Heinrich also discusses different strategies animals use for surviving the winter including hibernation, torpor and raising body temperature.  His passion was evident in his writing. Definitely one of the best animal biology books I've read. I put a list of interesting parts of the book into the spoiler section: (view spoiler)[Heinrich explores how animals survived in freezing conditions.  “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”“There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"
253,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"I have some seriously mixed feelings about this guy. On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

When it is no longer efficient to gather food, an animal ceases to do so. I thought that was interesting and it manifested itself in different manners: squirrels will leave the last couple seeds on a pine cone, a bear will hibernate.This is not a bad book, just one that I did not connect to.

Now a biology professor as well as a naturalist, he continues to spend a great deal of his time in the forests around him, even in the deepest cold. It is to our benefit, as he brings us a book like this, so packed with information about how animals survive those extreme tests of the winter months. This book is full of detail about the different species who populate those Maine and Vermont woods, and areas even further north. The tiny kinglet, barely bigger than a hummingbird, holds a special fascination for the author, and there are segments in several chapters that provide information about this bird's biological makeup, as well as how they eat, sleep, and the efforts they make to keep warm enough to survive the most bitter cold nights. There is also information about weasels, otters, bees, wasps, squirrels, turtles, butterflies, beavers, and many others. There are chapters devoted to the building of nests, and of how animals store food.I found this an absorbing read, and it was a treat to read during the cold months here, even if our coldest in the Missouri Ozarks does not dip nearly so low as those norther climes.

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

I loved the way the author, who is also a professor, describes the way questions of animal behavior arose out of his observations of the wildlife around his home and cabin, and he then proceeded to investigate to find the answers to his questions. The author also includes information on the sources for many of the facts he puts forward right into the text of the book. I liked this aspect of his writing as well. "

270,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5778181-burd,4,"This book brought me back to my childhood. I was a science nerd from a very young age and at one time I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals so much. Things didn't quite work out that way. I became a nurse instead and never had any regrets about that, but my love for animals remains strong to this day. With that in mind, some readers may not find this book all that interesting. In my nerdy opinion, Winter World was fascinating and beautifully written. Heinrich examines hundreds of common creatures and their unique ways they have adapted to surviving the cold winter. To me, that subject is just amazing!His enthusiasm and passion for the subject are contagious. Many of his observations are from his cabin in the woods of Vermont. Each fact is well referenced. However, I never felt like I was reading a science text book. It has more of a field diary feel to it complete with many delightful sketches of the plants and animals he writes about. At times it does get a bit repetitive and there were a couple of experiments he did that bothered me because they involved disturbing animals in the wild. But overall, I found it well balanced and educational.Anytime I learn something new from reading a book, I feel like it was time well spent. In this case, I learned more than I will probably retain. The topics, like why hibernating bears do not lose bone mass, why birds migrate in flocks, how the blood chemistry of insects changes to prevent freezing solid, and how bees keep the hive alive all winter long, were discussed in an easy to understand way but I liked that many scientific facts were given as well. After reading this book I will never again be able to go on a trail run through the woods without thinking about all the cool stuff that goes on underneath the snow. "
271,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"I have had this book on my shelf for a few years. Yesterday, after receiving about 10"" of snow here in New England, it seemed like the perfect reading choice for me. I curled up near the fireplace and front windows where the bird feeder sits, and watched some of my tiny feathered friends brave the elements to fill their bellies. I quickly became fascinated with the book: Winter World; Bernd Heinrich.The author is a biologist, and an illustrator, and this book has the most wonderful hand drawn illustrations. By exploring the the woods and studying the environment, mostly here in New England (Maine and Vermont) we learn some of the survival approaches employed by turtles, mice, squirrels, bats, bears, beavers, bees, beetles, birds and butterflies.The general question is how do animals survive winters, when food may be scarce and temperatures extreme? We learn how birds, mammals, amphibians and insects are able to survive and some even thrive in the cold and snow covered lands. The chipmunk, for example, builds a 12 foot burrow system that includes a nest chamber three feet underground, several food storage chambers, and escape tunnels as well as the main channel. They hibernate not only when it's cold but, also when there's a low food supply.This book full of amazing facts and details that answered a lot of the questions I've had for years about challenges our furry and feathered friend face each winter. A perfect winter read. RECOMMENDED!"
272,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"What do I think? Very generous of Bernd Heinrich to share his knowledge through this book. I have to check his film called, ""AN UNCOMMON CURIOSITY: at home & in nature with BERND HEINRICH"". This is a book, rich with information about survival of life in the winter, that also reads like a novel. Well, we all have curiosity, and the professionals (Science) take it to a certain level that helps expand our knowledge base. Knowing the fact that a kinglet weighs only 4-8 grams, and such incredible low-density, puts me in awe. To put it in perspective, imagine water in that tiny little cologne sampler bottle, which is roughly 5ml/5cc and that's how much the bird weighs. To top it all, it's ability to survive -40 degrees Celsius without torpor techniques of a tortoise! Also interesting to me is, when Dr. Brend writes in more than one places, what makes a naturalist's heart soar. Apparently it is the research that doesn't have the immediate practical implications, but the pleasure of finding how nature works. This being the case for research in fundamental Science, I think we owe it to ourselves collectively to fund this and consider it a privilege as opposed to cheap shopkeeper type arguments. Here's something that's pretty close to home. It is Life Sciences. In Chapter14, Dr. Bernd says, ""I'm forced to confront how differently a physical and a life scientist sees the world..... and I suspect it would be difficult to find an entomologist who is also a theist"". Amen!"
273,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627603-patti,5,"This book was fascinating all the way through. The individual adaptions each species makes to survive are truly amazing. The students that Professor Heinrich teaches a The University of Vermont are truly lucky. After reading this book, I want to stop and intently watch every bird and bug and mammal, etc that I encounter on my walks.Here is a sample of what can be learned in this book.The adult goldenrod fly injects an egg into a goldenrod stem in the early summer. Chemicals injected with the egg or produced by the larva cause the plant to produce a tumor or gall which is soft on the inside and woody on the outside.""From within it the larva taps the plant's resources and uses them for its own growth."".... ""By late summer the goldenrod, the gall and the larva have stopped growing and the larva then chews an escape tunnel from the center of the gall all the way to, but not through, the outermost edge. Retreating back in to the center of the tough woody gall, it spends the winter there, in hibernation. That the larva makes the escape hatch when it does is essential, because the adult gall fly does not have chewing mouth-parts and it would otherwise remain entombed within the gall."" "
274,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,4,"I enjoyed this book even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I purchased this book several months ago, but decided to wait until winter to read it so that it would line up seasonally and perhaps I could observe some of the animals I'd be reading about. I was very curious about how different animals survive winter and this book does contain a lot of good information on that. But the book also has a lot of the author's own anecdotes. He frequently describes walking through the woods in Maine or Vermont and observing different birds and rodents. These parts of the book read more like a memoir than biology, which wasn't really what I had set out to read (although it did inspire me to learn about the different trees and animals around me when I eventually get out of DC and own land). Despite the large chunks of memoir-like passages, I learned a lot from this book such as how snapping turtles, who breathe oxygen, can survive for months under ice, or how bears go months without urinating and convert nitrogen into protein. These stories are all told by a very enthusiastic author, creating an enjoyable seasonal read."
275,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544632-stasia,4,"Animals are amazing! And this book is full of crazy examples of just why they're so amazing.I was a little worried when I started and was confronted with a chapter called ""A Note on Terms and Definitions,"" which was about as interesting as it sounds, but from there it went nowhere but up. Heinrich covers a whole bunch of different winter adaptations, from frogs who freeze solid for months at a time (that's a pretty crazy one), to super-arctic moths who live for THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN years in larvae form before finally becoming moths for one glorious summer, long enough to mate, die, and leave more larvae behind. Somehow, this books manages to be both scientifically and narratively interesting. It was kind of a tease in that he'll talk a little about one kind of animal, enough that I get really interested, and then he's on to the next. But in a book of this scope, I think that's probably how it has to go. And if I want to learn more about the nitty-gritty biological specifics of any one animal, I can look it up myself. I totally recommend this book. "
276,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4742865-ellen,3,"I learned a great deal about animals in winter. Most of it was facinating. The author vacilated between storyteller and scientist. I had trouble with the scientific portions as my background is college level general biology from 40 years ago. The storyteller made up for the science that bogged down my reading. Learning about the changes that different animals go through in winter to cope with the cold weather just so they can survive to reproduce again was facinating. And how scientists and amateure scienctists discovered how some animals cope was equally amazing. Heinrich kept me reading through (and sometimes over) the detailed science because I knew there was understandable, and at times beautifully written passages just ahead."

The author walks through many different experiments from freezing frogs, caterpillars, birds and more. Many of these animals have natural mechanisms to deal with freezing temperatures. Heinrich also discusses different strategies animals use for surviving the winter including hibernation, torpor and raising body temperature.  His passion was evident in his writing. Definitely one of the best animal biology books I've read. I put a list of interesting parts of the book into the spoiler section: (view spoiler)[Heinrich explores how animals survived in freezing conditions.  “Much that animals have evolved to do would have seemed impossible to us, if experience has not taught us otherwise.”“There is no magic. It is a matter of details—of getting everything just right.” For his research on kinglets : To find out how quickly a fully feathered kinglet loses body heat, I experimentally heated a dead kinglet and then measured its cooling rate. … My naked kinglet had a 2.5 more rapid cooling rate than fully feathered ones. To get a rough idea of whether the flying squirrel’s nest indeed affords much insulation, I heated a potato to simulate the body of a squirrel and examined its cooling rates.I took on the brave, or foolish, task of measuring hornets’ body temperatures, grabbing and stabbing them with an electronic thermometer as they left their nests.I do not know how many seeds a chipmunk usually packs into each of its two pouches—I easily inserted sixty black sunflower seeds through the mouth into just one pouch of a roadkill.""There is a whimsical story of the townsfolk in a village in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont— an isolated backwoods area known for its cold winters— where the residents of one little village were said to avoid the awful winters by downing a few stiff drinks in the fall and then freezing themselves solid and then unthawing to resume an active life at an appropriate time in the spring.""Some types of frogs stop breathing and their hearts stop beating entirely for days to weeks at a time. In fact, during its period of frozen winter hibernation, the frogs’ physical processes — from metabolic activity to waste production — grind to a near halt. What’s more, the frogs are likely to endure multiple freeze/ thaw episodes over the course of a winter. (hide spoiler)]"
283,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"I have some seriously mixed feelings about this guy. On the one hand, he clearly appreciates the natural world and has a lot of interesting things to say about it. On the other, he feels that his curiosity is the only justification needed to essentially torture small animals. I get the argument that our improved understanding of animal physiology should allow us to better steward our environments but some of this stuff is just getting really carried away. We've never known more about the natural world and yet we've also never caused more damage to it than we do now. Indigenous groups that believed in fairies and monsters did a much better job maintaining their local ecosystems. Figuring out how to protect nature clearly isn't just a matter of learning more trivial details. All these new discoveries have mainly just helped our psychotic leaders build new weapons and manipulate the majority of people into doing their bidding. Maybe they'll eventually lead to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates living forever in some sort of space colony while the rest of us pay for the consequences of their fuck ups. Why should anyone want to support that though? If we can't learn something without committing atrocities then we probably are just better off letting the mystery remain unexplained. And honestly, I'm not sure he's even right about some of this stuff. He talks about animals that freeze themselves to survive winter needing to do it slowly to prevent large ice crystals from ripping their cell membranes. I know that with frozen foods it's the complete opposite, needing to freeze as quickly as possible to prevent those large crystals. Maybe something about their body chemistry makes it different for them or something but it definitely didn't sound right to me. Most of what he says is probably pretty close to true though, and even his least ethical experiments aren't quite what most of us would label ""atrocities"", but I do feel kind of dirty when I read stuff like this. The general ideas about hibernation, freezing, torpor, migration, etc. should be enough without knowing exact body temperatures and stomach contents and all this other crap. "

Bernd Heinrich filled ""Winter World"" with his own semi-amateurish but adoringly crafted pencil drawings of little birds all fluffed up. Just kill me.""Winter World"" is about animals barely surviving winter. And they really barely survive. For example, chickadees lose most of their fat stores every single night- one multi-day snowstorm is all it takes to wipe out entire populations. In another version of this book, their survival would seem harrowing, a life lived right on the edge. But instead, this book milks that survival for maximum cuteness. Flying squirrels cuddle twelve to a single birdhouse. Birds that weigh as little as two pennies huddle in tight circles and tuck their beaks into their tail feathers. Even honeybees form cute airtight bee balls. Then there's Bernd himself, with his incredible enthusiasm for working out the lives of the woodland creatures just for his curiosity alone. (view spoiler)[A large chunk of the book is dedicated to his attempt to learn how kinglets sleep, ultimately fruitlessly.

For someone who never field-dressed a deer or a grouse, it is sometimes unsettling how careless he appears to be towards his subjects, reserving judgement for the value of whatever insight he is hoping to gather from luring honeybees out of their hives.That being said, it is more relevant to appreciate the depth of the science he is hoping to discover; the quality of reanimation that the hibernation of reptiles, mammals and birds hints at, the still unknown qualities of our evolutionary cousins that may yield breakthroughs in our own biological sciences.A lot of important discoveries were made by accident, (penicillin for example) and oftentimes the real alchemy is recognizing a surprising result is not a mistake but a tendency."

The author managed to take his readers into his lens and observed the animals behavior in the winter. We may assume all animals do is hibernated and slept until the end of winter. It might be true for bear and certain mammals but not all are using the same method. The complexity of some animals went through in retaining their heat while surviving winter is truly remarkable. Some remain frozen but not dead, some vibrating so that they can regulate the temperature and some keep haunting for food so that they won't lose their body fats. They did all of this to survive the harsh weather."

And instead of strengthening the science, the anecdotal accounts detracted from any legitimacy of the theories presented. Just because the author found X number of caterpillars and nests in the area near his cabin one winter doesn't mean anything. Also, there's no real order or structure which further increased my distraction and boredom. This is such a fascinating topic but poorly executed."

The one I read was a library book, but I bought my own copy after reading because Im sure I will want to reread. I loved the way the author, who is also a professor, describes the way questions of animal behavior arose out of his observations of the wildlife around his home and cabin, and he then proceeded to investigate to find the answers to his questions. The author also includes information on the sources for many of the facts he puts forward right into the text of the book. I liked this aspect of his writing as well. "

This book explains how. Sometimes it goes into more detail than I really wanted, but overall, I found it to be very interesting.Now I want to actually see a Kinglet bird. I've seen most of the creatures mentioned in this book near my home, but never a Kinglet."

As usual, I needed a professional to read it to me before I could get through it. And, as usual, I was capable of only limited learning with the audiobook format, but I'd like to try again in print.Packed with insight, rich in the life stories of winter-adapted animals, and leaves you feeling horribly envious of Heinrich, his cabin, and his life wandering around banging on trees and looking for animals."
295,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38991128-malcolm-schmitz,3,"If you like your science hard, this is not the book for you. This book is more like your grandfather - who happens to be a scientist- sitting down and telling you a long, long set of stories about how animals survive the winter. There's a fair bit of anthropomorphism and weird tangents about Jack London and how nature is amazing. Still, it was neat learning about how animals survive the winter. They do some crazy stuff, huh? "
296,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20356170-thomas-warger,4,Really engrossing vignettes about how the biggest and smallest creatures--and many in between--in the Maine woods survive winter. I also liked Heinrich's willingness to show the little misadventures he experienced in trying to observe and learn. Those make the discoveries all the more interesting. A very personal account in the tradition of Thoreau.
297,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1395140-donna,3,"In between some fairly heavy scientific jargon and detail, there are wonderful insights into how our nature friends survive the winter....birds, turtles, mice, squirrels, chipmunks. I appreciate how this may make a winter snowshoe more interesting, looking for some evidence of these winter hardy creatures."
298,0060957379,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32074126-tim,5,"With beautifully drawn illustrations and meticulously crafted prose, the author provides a picture of life in what many would presume is a forbidding winter landscape. His patience to observe bees, birds, and other animals in the frozen forests of Maine and Vermont, Heinrich inspires readers to contemplate the wonder of survival in hostile environments."

I really enjoyed the mystery of the kinglets and how they survive winter as a recurring comparison to other animals throughout the book, and I'm eager to use what I've learned this fall and winter to compare New England animal populations with Virginia populations."
