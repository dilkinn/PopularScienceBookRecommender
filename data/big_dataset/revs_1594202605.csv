0,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Humans have evolved the ability to be cooperative, in order to help our own survival in difficult times. This ability usually prevents us from being completely selfish. We cooperate with other members of our group, our ""tribe"", and solves the dilemma between ""Me"" and ""Us"". The problem is, that this same mechanism generates a different dilemma, a competition between ""Us"" and ""Them"". We find that we generally have the same moral outlook as others in our ""tribe"", and we do not even consider the moral outlook of outsiders.This, in a nutshell, is the basic dilemma in this excellent book by Joshua Greene. Greene is the director of the Moral Cognition Lab in Harvard University's Department of Psychology. He conducts psychological experiments, and uses the results to develop some fascinating theories about the problem of morality.I was very much surprised by some experiments concerning the perceived risks of climate change. Contrary to what I expected, the degree of scientific literacy and numeracy is inversely correlated with the perception of risk due to climate change. Instead, the membership in a political ""tribe"" is a much better predictor of belief in the risks. While the vast majority of scientists believe in the risks, most people do not want to ""consult"" with the experts in this area. They prefer to ""consult"" with other members of their political sphere.Much of the book is devoted to the famous moral dilemma of the ""trolley-car"". Suppose a trolley car is out of control. It will soon run over and kill a group of five workmen, unless something is done immediately. You have access to a track switch, that will switch the trolley onto a siding where only a single workman will be killed. The question is, would you pull the switch? Most people would pull the switch.But now, here is the moral dilemma, for a somewhat different scenario. Suppose the same trolley is on course to kill five workmen. But you are up on a footbridge, and immediately in front of you is a man with an oversized backpack. If you were to push that man over the side of the bridge, the trolley car would be stopped, but that man would die. Again, would you push the man over? Most people would not.So, why not? What is the moral difference between pulling the switch and pushing the man over the side? The outcomes would be the same, so why do most people make a distinction? Here, Joshua Greene analyzes this question in great detail. The simplest explanation, is that in the switch case, the death of the lone workman is an incidental side effect, while in the case of pushing the man over the side of the footbridge, that act is the means to an end. Greene takes these scenarios and presents a compelling theory, why most people have such a strong aversion to pushing the man off the footbridge.Joshua Greene discusses a moral philosophy called utilitarianism. This philosophy advocates that people should act to maximize the collective level of happiness. There are plenty of critics of this philosophy, but Greene does a good job of addressing their criticisms. Greene looks at the controversy surrounding abortions. He shows that the two sides in the controversy claim certain rights; pro-lifers claim the right to life, while pro-choice people claim that a woman has a right to choose what happens to her body. Greene analyzes the controversy in some detail, and concludes that both sides have excellent arguments, and that both sides are somewhat hypocritical in their not taking their ""rights"" arguments to their logical conclusions. In the end, Greene concludes that any argument that relies on ""rights"" are specious. Instead, he recommends a pragmatic approach, that requires some deep ""manual"" thinking.A leit motif throughout the book is a metaphor, which likens our moral outlook to a camera with automatic and manual settings. Evolution has given us an ""automatic"" mode of thinking, where we generally hold the beliefs of our tribe. But, tribes often have moral beliefs that conflict with those of other tribes, and neither set of beliefs are necessarily ""better"". So it behooves us to switch over to ""manual"" mode, and use reason to think about the issues. At the end of the book, Greene offers six pragmatic ""rules"" to help resolve moral issues. If you are interested in philosophy, in morality, or sociology, I highly recommend this book."
1,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,3,"There's a lot to be said about Moral Tribes but I will divide the comment roughly into two parts: (1) the smart commentary on moral psychology and (2) the weak commentary on ethics. It is worth noting that the strong points and weak points should be unsurprising given Greene's background; he's a renown neuroscientist. It seems to make sense that his recapitulation of his groundbreaking work would be terrific and engaging, and that the book would weaken in discussions of other domains. The opening chapters of the book, though, are even stronger than I anticipated. Greene talks elegantly through the game theory, evolutionary biology, and eventually neuroscience that underlie his theory of cognition. It is an absolute master class in science writing for a mainstream audience. For the first few chapters alone I recommend reading the book, if for no other reason than to glean the smart interdisciplinary methodologies of evolutionary psychology and neuroscience. Greene's theory of moral cognition is compelling, but he also doesn't skimp on engaging with his competitors. His discussion of John Mikhail is the best I've read (I'll be reading Mikhail's major book next) and he has me convinced that the folks in this domain are really all having good, productive discussion, which isn't always the default in academia. I suspect that Greene's theory is incomplete, but I'm sure he'd be able to engage well with my technical concerns. (Several of them have already been engaged in his exchanges with some philosophers.)The book goes off the rails in the philosophical discussion of the last 100 or so pages. My concerns are numerous, the first is that he is strikingly dismissive of rights based theories (pp. 305) without actually referring to any of the literature on said theories and then immediately turning around and suggesting that in some cases it's ok to used rights based theories to protect beliefs against the utilitarian arguments he advocates (pp. 308). It's not really a well developed step-change, and he stumbles over it in his attempt to illustrate the abortion issue, where he mangles together ethical and public policy considerations. The book should be taken seriously for what it does well, offer a tremendous contribution to the blossoming field of moral psychology. It demonstrates the significant role neuroscience and psychology have to play in understanding social relations and, for that, we ought to be attentive. But it would be nice if the philosophical discussions were a bit more rigorous. I suspect there's a lot more to come from Greene, though, and that it will get more philosophically sophisticated in the future, as his work does include a lot of serious engagement with philosophers."
2,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara,5,"I'm going to go ahead and assume that there are summaries out there that will tell you what this book is about, so I'm just gonna tell you why I think it was pretty great.1. It's enormously readable - True to his affiliation as a utilitarian, Greene keeps his arguments clear and fairly concise. When he's gonna go more into depth on something that isn't crucial to understanding his overall point he tells you to go for it and skip ahead. 2. He summarizes the arguments of a lot of authors/books that I have enjoyed reading, but that might be less accessible. So, yay for TL;DR versions of a lot of Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt, Paul Bloom, and then the brigade of classic moral philosophers (e.g. Kant, Bentham and Mills etc.)3. and beyond Whether or not you come out of this agreeing with Greene, you will have a much better, disambiguated sense of key concepts in moral philosophy/psychology, moral cognition and of the overall utilitarian (which he calls deep pragmatism) approach to moral philosophy.The last time I read anything on utilitarianism I just remember walking away from it wanting to push Peter Singer in front of a trolley. (That's a joke, by the way, if you're not much of a trolley-ologist.) There are a bunch of ways in which utilitarianism is often (according to Greene) misconstrued, but the one that resonated most with me was Greene's response to the idea that ""Utilitarianism requires you to turn yourself into a happiness pump.""This is what turned me off to, at the very least, Peter Singer's utilitarianism, but Greene brings up a really great point:There's a social dimension to the problem that may, in the long run, favor strong efforts over heroic ones. Your life is a model for others...If you improve the lives of hundreds of people every year through your charitable donations, but your life remains happy and comfortable, you're a model that others can emulate. If, instead, you push yourself to just shy of your breaking point, you may do more good directly with your personal donation dollars, but you may undermine the larger cause by making an unappealing example...Yes! This is the point I wish I had been coherently able to make to the vegan in one of my classes (note: I am a non-dairy consuming vegetarian) who wouldn't drink beer because of the yeast in it. I'm sure there's some argument to be made for his case, but I just felt like he made vegetarianism and veganism seem absurd. And ridiculous. Ok, I'll move on. This book is applied moral psychology. He explains how our brains work, why we might think the ways we do, when our intuitive thinking is useful, and when it causes trouble for us. What Greene addresses is how we, as a society, might be better off addressing issues that are controversial. He doesn't solve these issues, but he makes a good case for why (as we tend to do) having each side justify its own beliefs is a recipe for polarization and disaster. "
3,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,4,"As a fresh take on utilitaniarism it’s first-rate: new perspectives, new research, insightful questions. But ultimately he’s just preaching to the choir because the single most important question of our age is not even mentioned: how to reach those who don’t realize they are immoral? That is, people whose brains—through no fault of their own—consider Loyalty To Tribe and Obedience To Authority to be moral, rendering them vulnerable to charismatic psychopaths like Rush Limbaugh or evangelical preachers or anyone on Fox “News”. They’re not going to read this. They’re not going to question their gut reactions or listen to anyone suggesting that they do (“heresy!”). This is a very real problem, and unfortunately no amount of philosophical arguing is going to address that. And on that depressing note, Happy Newtonmas!"
4,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,3,"Update, July 2019: As I noted in the review, Greene cemented his reputation (partially) by putting folks into fMRI machines and asking them Trolleyology–type questions. Well, if you find that interesting, you should check out the Kickstarter game Trial By Trolley: A party game of moral dilemmas and trolley murder. It’s offensively gruesome, so maybe it’s best to think of it as Trolleyology by way of Cards Against Humanity. Definitely not for the squeamish, but I’ve definitely ordered a copy.                    ☠️🚋☠️Greene looks at the evolutionary origins of intergroup conflict, and attempts to demonstrate that “deep pragmatism” (a form of utilitarianism) can address the dilemma that arises due to human’s evolution as a tribal species.He doesn’t succeed, however. His reasoning contains a few flaws, but ultimately he simply doesn’t address the toughest cases and relies on something akin to an “appeal to urgency”. That isn’t listed as a fallacy in my textbook on critical thinking, but so what?A wealth of background and history is given, though, which makes the book a fairly useful one. Greene does repeat himself somewhat (probably a subconscious effort to bolster his weak case), and a good editor could probably have shaved off a few dozen pages, at least.The problem at hand is described as the Tragedy of Commonsense Morality. This is Greene’s intergroup analogue of the well-studied intragroup paradox known as the Tragedy of the Commons. Both are gradually explored through the use of game theory, neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.Trolleyology is used a lot in his analysis. This is understandable: Greene cemented his reputation as a cognitive researcher by asking test subjects about that infamous moral dilemma while inside of a fMRI machine. So it is a little ironic that this is also where he stumbles.First, he conflates two sets of answers. He argues quite persuasively that evolution took some shortcuts in coming up with quick-and-dirty responses to different patterns, and that the divergence in those responses to very similar situations is arbitrary for an understandable reason. To put it very briefly, our different answer to the “footbridge” versus the baseline “switch” situations is because we are “blind to side effects” because evolution didn’t give us the ability to intuitively keep track of multiple chains of causality (see page 225 and following). That’s fine… except he later tells us that when philosophers created a deontological reason for the same thing, that we must dismiss their reasoning as mere rationalization. Uh, no: very poor logic. Even if it is true that the flawed evolutionary-constructed intuition is inconsistent in its conclusions, that doesn’t mean that any other analysis of the same situation must be as well. The remainder of the book relies on his erroneous belief that he could effectively dispense with ethics.Second, Greene introduces a very hard ethical case early in his discussion of trolleyology: that of a surgeon who is able to heal several other people by stealing organs from one healthy (albeit unwilling) donor (see page 109). He admits to being blindsided by that, so I anticipated him showing how it would be dealt with at some point with his utilitarian approach. But he never did. Instead, he relied on some hand-waving, asserting that utilitarianism, if wisely applied, would prove capable of being deeply pragmatic. Wait — we have to rely on wisdom? But isn’t that precisely what is in short supply? In fact, he points out that just thinking really hard isn’t going to help us — our brains are wired very poorly for that (page 296).The “rationalizations” of ethics address the hard cases fairly well. Specifically, the doctrine of double effect in conjunction with Kant’s categorical imperative, “God damn it, you've got to be kind.” His goal was laudable, but the problem is harder than he perceived.Ultimately, however, this wasn’t the book I expected it to be. The word “tribes” in the title implied something a bit different to me than Greene intended, and I was disappointed about that, too. As I’ve noted, the “tribe” Greene points to is the evolutionary source of our quite irrational thinking about intergroup conflict resolution. What I hoped the book was going to be about was the highly “tribal” partisan behavior that plagues society today. My favorite academic addressing this is still Dan Kahan, who researches Identity-Protective Cultural Cognition at Yale Law School. But he hasn’t written any books that cover the subject broadly, and his risk-perception orientation isn’t quite what I’m looking for. The basic idea is that the tribal roots of our cognition (what Greene is also pointing to) create a very strong impetus for us to “think” in terms of tribes even today, and that kind of motivated thinking is becoming increasingly prevalent. A good primer on that is the New Yorker article,

5,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993735-bruce,2,"4 stars for the science related material, a generous 2 stars for the philosophical goop, which comprises the bulk of the book. To deflect criticisms of utilitarianism, Greene qualifies its ""rules"" to such a degree that nothing is left save: think carefully about things and your obligation to help others. That's fine, but I don't need to read hundreds of pages to arrive at that dictum. The science portions of the book could have been better directed. The author goes into great detail regarding the trolley dilemma. While this discussion was interesting, and this dilemma nicely traces the interplay between emotion and reason, other emotional modules are highly relevant to group/tribe formation and interactions; these should have been discussed (in addition to the trolley stuff). These other modules may be especially important, since in modern Western society, groups do not result from geographical isolation. Group formation in modern societies may depend on one's location on the individualist vs. collectivist spectrum, which might be determined from a complex interplay between genetics and one's assessment of whether one will benefit or be harmed by redistribution of wealth. In turn, one's location on this spectrum may influence group membership, and that membership likely profoundly affects the emotional (mis)interpretation of real world data (even by a Harvard professor). I don't require a book on groups to adopt my view, but in such a book, I really want to read an attempt to understand what underpins group formation in Western society."
6,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"The tragedy of the commons was proposed in 1968 by Garrett Hardin it involves the conflicting interests between the individual (me) and the group (us). Humans solved this dilemma many hundreds of thousands of years ago. Our minds according to Joshua Greene are packed with moral gizmos in our brain that make us excellent cooperates and solve the dilemma of Me vs. Us which is Common sense morality. Common sense morality is the kind of heuristics we have and emotional responses to others that makes this cooperation possible.  The catch is that common sense moral modules that help us form groups form them in the presence of in group/ out group competition. While we are social we are also very tribal. In the modern world this translates into the ""Tragedy of Commonsense Morality"". Our tribal groupishness which at one time was an advantage is divide the world into hostile tribes and is tearing nations apart.  The author argues that a meta-morality will be need to adjudicate conflict between tribal groups and he offers a form of pragmatism or utilitarianism as a meta-morality. In this book we go on excursions of the famous ""trolley problem"" and into cognitive neuroscience and ethical philosophy. The author has a way of taking deep issues in neuroscience and complex issues in ethics philosophy and explaining it clearly and entertainingly. Much recommended."

8,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"Joshua Greene, an experimental psychologist, neuroscientist and philosopher, sets out to “use twenty-first-century science [neuroscience] to vindicate nineteenth-century moral philosophy [utilitarianism] against its twentieth-century critics [Rawls and other deontological ethicists].” And he succeeds admirably. This book persuasively and creatively tied together several strands of literature that interest me and will have an enduring impact on the way I think about ethical issues.Greene’s core argument is that humans evolved to be able to cooperate with each other, solving the problem of “me vs. us” (the “Tragedy of the Commons”) but in the process we created a new problem that is increasingly bedeviling us today of “us vs. them” (the “Tragedy of the Commonsense Morality”) where different “tribes” clash not because they are selfish and immoral but instead because they are deeply motivated by their morality to see their tribe as right and the other tribe as wrong. Greene proposes a solution to this which is to use “utilitarianism” as a “metamorality” to adjudicate places where different tribes have fundamental disagreements with each other. Greene grounds his arguments in a combination of critique of traditional deontological philosophical attempts to settle these issues (e.g., Kant and Rawls) along with an understanding of the neuroscience and psychology of how we actually do make decisions.A little more detail (and most of this is a summary of the book rather than a critique, in part for my own sake):Greene points out that humans are much better at solving the “tragedy of the commons” or the “prisoner’s dilemma” than a simplistic, selfish economic model would lead you to believe. A combination of moral beliefs, reciprocity, repeated games, willingness to punish, willingness to have asocial punishments of others, etc., can keep us working together. The way we overcome the Tragedy of the Commons is not original to Greene, Elinor Ostrom won a Nobel Prize for it in the context of the tragedy of the commons and Thomas Schelling in the context of the prisoner’s dilemma.Greene puts these solutions in the context of our “automatic settings” or quick reactions, that put us in a better position to solve these types of problems.Part of the solutions to the tragedy of the commons to have a tribal identity which comes with incidental beliefs about what is and is not wrong about a wide range of behavior. This is what gives rise to the tragedy of the commonsense morality where different tribes clash on issues like religion, abortion, LGBT rights, etc. This tragedy can’t be solved by our automatic settings but instead requires us to use our “manual mode” or reason. Greene argues that we all “get” utilitarianism, agree in general, and just need to work together on the facts/analysis so that we can use it in practice.Greene is scathing on the alternatives to his approach. One is religion/virtue, but this can solve the tragedy of the commons, but is really just elevating one tribe’s moral views and thus can’t solve conflicts between tribes. Another is Kant/Rawls, which Greene argues have failed to actually use reason, are riddled with logical flaws, and instead are just rationalizations of their particular tribe’s moralities. Instead utilitarianism allows one to transcend the limits of one’s tribal views.Greene defends utilitarianism against the idea that it us overly strong (e.g., requiring us to give up all our money to the least well off) by saying utilitarianism is really “deep pragmatism” and asking people to do something impossible they won’t do is itself not actually utilitarian. And he argues against the idea that it is to weak in not respecting “fundamental right” by pointing out that the reason these rights see so important is that they involve horrible consequences, and that more generally no one actually views the rights as absolute, and that they exacerbate tribal tensions, so appealing to rights is an emotional weapon not a sound argument.A lot of the argument and analysis of the book also involves empirical psychology, in particular Greene’s studies of various Trolley dilemmas, and trying to learn from how people make moral decisions and infer from this what a workable “deeply pragmatic” moral approach could be.As an aspiring but highly imperfect and inconsistent utilitarian/consequentialist, I was very happy to see that Greene grounds the approach in 21st century science, makes an argument for its universality, and addresses some of the shortcomings that intuitively bothered me, including the ways in which all of us fail to live up to Peter Singer’s vision of utilitarianism. I also appreciated that while Greene shared a certain amount of the analysis of Jonathan Haidt’s Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion, he was much less nihilistic and actually reached a conclusion with more teeth than just that liberals were morally deficient and we should understand each other better.But I still have a nagging worry that all of this is less reason than rationalization for a particular modern ideology that I happen to like. Moreover, even if it is correct, I’m still not sure that it is as applicable to solving the problem’s of warring tribes as Greene believes when so much of the wars involve different views of happiness, whose happiness and what happiness (e.g., in the case of abortion, does the “happiness” of the fetus count or not? Greene thinks utilitarianism can solve the abortion debates, I’m less sure). But those are nagging suspicions and I don’t think there is a better moral approach. And more important, by grounding this in empirical psychology and neuroscience Greene’s approach holds out the prospect of making further progress. I look forward to seeing it."
9,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9692204-satyajeet,4,"This is a powerful blend of neuroscience, psychology, and sociology. The first third or so is probably the most fascinating, with ideas about Individualism v/s Collectivism taking a front seat in the discussion. This is worth reading as it could fuel discussion around a variety of areas, including values-based decision making, inherited perspective, biases, bystander-intervention, and responding to the controversy.It points out that 'Reason is an evolved trait, like bipedalism. It emerged on the savannas of Africa, and has to be understood in that context. This makes much more sense if you've studied more on Cognitive dissonance and Biases before (One of them is confirmation bias: the tendency people have to embrace information that supports their beliefs and rejects information that contradicts them) Humans' biggest advantage over other species is the ability to co-operate. Cooperation is difficult to establish and almost as difficult to sustain. For any individual, freeloading is always the best course of action. Reason developed not to enable us to solve abstract, logical problems or even to help us draw conclusions from unfamiliar data; rather, it developed to resolve the problems posed by living in collaborative groups.Habits of mind that seem weird or goofy or just plain dumb from an “intellectualist” point of view prove shrewd when seen from a social “interactionist” perspective.“Humans, aren’t randomly credulous. Presented with someone else’s argument, we’re quite adept at spotting the weaknesses. Almost invariably, the positions we’re blind about are our own.”"

It turned out to be neither of those things. Instead, it's an extremely interesting look at why some actions make humans uncomfortable, why that impulse isn't always correct, and how to make ethical decisions without completely relying on ""gut feeling""."
11,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17536885-ariel-pontes,5,"A great contemporary defense of utilitarianism against the accusations of deontologists, virtue ethicists, and more recently of authors like Rawls, Nozick, and Jonathan Haidt. Essentially, its central argument is: if we want cooperate at the global scale, the widespread adoption of utilitarianism as a universal standard for public policy is the only available solution at this moment. The book adopts a pragmatist approach, avoiding metaethical questions such as ""but is this really the right thing to do in an absolute sense, or only as a means to achieve greater cooperation?"" or ""are moral truths discovered or invented?"", which I believe are interesting and should be explored, but perhaps in a dedicated volume. The book does a great job at defending utilitarianism against the classical thought experiments used to attack it (e.g. the footbridge dilemma, the transplant problem, the sheriff scenario, the utility monster, etc.), and explains using results from moral psychology that utilitarianism sometimes seems counterintuitive due to ""bugs"" in our cognitive machinery, which is like a dual-mode camera, with automatic settings (landscape, portrait, etc) and a manual mode. Our automatic settings are inflexible and uses fast, heuristic thinking, which evolved to deal with a very particular set problems that were common in our evolutionary history, such as the problem of ""me"" vs. ""us"". Our manual mode, on the other hand, is slow and resource-consuming, but it is extremely flexible. It is a general purpose learning machine that can apply logical reasoning to any kind of problem, even completely new ones. Since our automatic settings evolved because it conferred a competitive advantage to one group against another, it couldn't evolve instincts capable of automatically solving the problem of ""us"" vs. ""them"". Therefore, if we want to cooperate at a global scale, we need manual mode, and using our manual mode to think about morality inevitably leads to utilitarianism, which Greene somewhat tentatively tries to rebrand as ""deep pragmatism"". At the end of the day, a cold rational analysis of ourselves will always lead to the conclusion that what ultimately matters for us is the quality of our subjective experience. Any other proposed moral ""principle"" ultimately derives its value from its propensity to improve the quality of the experience of sentient beings."

I agree that utilitarianism (or 'deep pragmatism') basically is what we do when trying to find common ground (weighing harms and benefits), and I'm sympathetic to these kinds of 'Morality, Fast and Slow' trains of thought and research. (It's good to have Moral Cognition labs.) But I've yet to look into whether this/they help disagreeing moral tribes find common currency or manage to mostly preach to the already utilitarian crowd. Ultimately, harmonizing moral intuitions might require education in science and changes in metaphysical views. And maybe Moral Tribes falls under such education; but is it accessible enough to have effects outside the already sympathetic camp?ContentsGreene J (2013) (14:53) Moral Tribes - Emotion, Reason, and the Gap Between Us and ThemIntroduction: The Tragedy of Commonsense Morality• Life on the New Pastures• Toward a Global Moral Philosophy• The PlanPart I: Moral Problems01.

13,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32919449-leif-denti,4,"I enjoyed this book. It is generally well argued and lays out a pretty clear map over the moral philosophy and psychology field as of today. Greene does a good job in arguing for the distinction between the Tragedy of the Commons (within-group moral reasoning), and what he calls the Tragedy of Common Sense Morality (between-group moral reasoning). In essence: we are good at cooperating and empathizising with each other when it comes to our own in-group, but bad at cooperating and empathizising with out-groups as our emotional circuitry doesn't seem to extend to out-groups very well. Greene seeks to bridge this gap and calls for a ""meta-morality"", one that everyone can accept regardless of our particular in-group ideosyncrasies.The meta-morality most fitting, according to Greene, is utilitarianism. Sadly, this is where the book loses its momentum and Greenes argumentation becomes sloppy. We are to accept utilitarianism because it is pragmatic and that other attempts at creating a meta-morality (like Kant) have failed. I do like Greenes notion that utilitarianism offers a universial moral ""currency"", that is happiness, however, this only pushes the problem one step further. Instead of arguing over what is right and what is wrong, we should argue over happiness, which of course comes with the usual problems like how we should measure happiness and how we would know which option impacts happiness most.The book has a few straw-man arguments as well as other biases which isnt fitting for a book (and author) of this calibre. It recieves four stars from me."

Still worth reading for at least the early chapters, though."
15,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17711392-aseem-kaul,5,"There's a great deal to love about Moral Tribes, which is just about the most intellectually stimulating book I read in 2013. Here's my brief (possibly somewhat inaccurate) summary of what Greene is saying:1 Human beings face two types of moral problems: the problem of small-group cooperation (Me vs. Us) and the problem of global cooperation (Us vs. Them). Where small-group cooperation fails we end up with the Tragedy of the Commons. Where global cooperation fails we end up with what Greene calls the Tragedy of Commonsense Morality - groups of people in conflict with each other because they both avidly subscribe to distinct moral codes2. The moral codes we subscribe to within groups are the result of a long process of psychological and social evolution that has helped us develop emotional instincts that promote intra-group cooperation. As a result, most people possess strong moral intuition (enforced through emotional triggers) that pushes them to automatically make choices that are *moral* from an intra-group perspective3. Unfortunately, this kind of intuitive or knee-jerk morality is subject to several limitations, not being designed to deal with complex global problems. In particular, while our automatic response may help promote intra-group cooperation it also tends to foster inter-group competition and conflict, making us biased towards our own 'tribal' ways of thinking, and causing us to make inconsistent and irrational choices driven by emotional response. 4. We therefore need some basis of metamorality - a principle or rule to allow us to resolve conflicts between groups and their diverse moral codes 5. Utilitarianism (or what Greene calls deep pragmatism), which is defined as the pursuit of human happiness with everyone's happiness (or utility) being weighted equally is the best available candidate for such a metamorality. It is not the ideal candidate - Greene is not claiming that is it the supreme moral principle - it is simply the metamorality most likely to end conflict and enable inter-group cooperation. 6. Utilitarianism is uniquely positioned to serve as a pragmatic metamorality because:6.1 It is based on an underlying value - happiness, or the value of the human experience - that is shared by all cultures and people, and deeply ingrained in our rational minds6.2 It is a good complement to our tribal moral intuitions:6.2.1 On the one hand it helps to overcome the our automatic bias of only caring about those proximate to us, by giving equal weight to everyone's happiness - ours and the other tribes6.2.2 On the other hand, our natural moral instincts protect against the worst conceptual problems with utilitarianism - excessive egalitarianism (what Greene calls turning ourselves into happiness pumps) or the oppresion of minorities7. Greene's prescription, then, is that we need to use two moral compasses - an instinctive / emotional / fast compass based on moral intuition to be invoked when dealing with me vs. us problems, and a rational / cognitive / slow compass based on utilitarian principles when dealing with morally controversial issues involving us vs. them conflicts.8. More specifically, Greene believes that shifting morally controversial discussions away from claims about 'rights' and 'duties' (that cannot, ultimately be unsubstantiated, and really reflect nothing more than rationalizations of our (tribal) moral instincts), towards a dialog about the effect of moral choices on overall utility (that may be subject to empirical investigation) will help us to overcome (or at least make progress towards overcoming) the Tragedy of Commonsense Morality. Personally, I agree with most of Greene's points here, and found the overall argument quite thought-provoking and insightful. I think Greene does an especially convincing job of laying out the nature of the problem (points 1 to 4) and while I'm less convinced about the supremacy of utilitarianism, I did find his analysis of the complementarity between rational utilitarianism and moral intuition quite insightful, and think he offers one of the strongest defenses of utilitarianism I've read in a long time. Plus, it helps that his writing is both precise and accessible, and that he peppers his argument with an assortment of experimental studies in psychology that make for fascinating reading. This is not suggest, of course, that Greene's argument is without its flaws. Here, in no particular order, are the main issues I had with the book:a) Greene pays too little attention to issues of agency and choice. Giving away half your income to help total strangers is a very different proposition from having half your income taken away and redistributed to total strangers. And the difference is moral in a utilitarian sense because the effect of the former action on your happiness is likely to be very different from the effect of the latter. In general, I think Greene's arguments work well at the level of personal choice (we should all give more) but not so well when we no longer have agency.b) Perhaps as a consequence of being more a psychologist, Greene seems to pay too little attention to the social dimensions of happiness. What we derive utility from, and how much utility we derive from it, is often socially constructed. This creates three problems:i. To the extent that our utility comes from the maintenance of our tribal norms, utilitarianism may not help to overcome inter-group conflict. If the fact that public policy is in conflict the code of my tribe genuinely makes me deeply unhappy then utilitarianism may not be a panacea. More generally, utilitarianism would logically lead to the beliefs of the group that had more fundamentalist beliefs being privileged over the beliefs of others. ii. It creates a new set of me vs. us problems - if my happiness is based on social comparisons, then moral choices that I would accept if my entire tribe made them may be unacceptable to me personally. So for instance, making less money may not make me significantly unhappier per se, but making less money than my peers may. So evenly deeply pragmatic individuals may fail to accept alternate moral positions if they mean moving away from their peer group. iii. While not strictly an issue for Greene's argument, I think it is worth thinking about where our utility functions come from. Utilitarianism makes a great deal of sense if the sources of human happiness are universal products of our psychological evolution as a species, and Greene often seems to assume they are. It makes a lot less sense if they are socially constructed and subject to manipulation by others within / outside our group. c) I'm skeptical about the ability of a shift to utilitarianism to provide a evidence-based foundation for conflict resolution. As a social scientist myself, I understand the appeal of the idea that we base policy conclusions on empirical evidence (what works) rather than unsubstantiated beliefs, but I also recognize that most empirical evidence is contentious, provisional, and subject to multiple explanations. Which means that the shift to utilitarianism may achieve little more than a shift from unresolvable conflicts between the rights championed by different groups, to unresolvable conflicts between the empirical results championed by different groups. d) This evidence problem is made worse by the fact that, as Greene himself points out, people are incredibly bad at understanding what utility means and thinking about it clearly, frequently confusing it with wealth, consumption, pleasure, etc. Greene makes this point in defense of utilitarianism, and I think he's right as far as utilitarianism as a theory goes. But to make a concept that ordinary humans have a difficult time getting their head around the basis for the metamorality that will solve all inter-group conflict seems like a particularly bad idea.e) While I actually agree with Greene on pragmatism being a good basis for choosing a metamorality, it's worth noting that this is, in itself, a utilitarian conclusion. Why is the metamorality that best enables inter-group cooperation the best metamorality? That's only true if our goal is to reduce conflict and increase overall happiness (a utilitarian ideal). A different metamorality may prize conflict between groups. Theoretically, at least Greene's argument runs into the tautological problem of coming to the conclusion that utilitarianism (or deep pragmatism) is the best metamorality by adopting a utilitarian (or deeply pragmatic) criterion to evaluate metamoralities. Pragmatically, this is a problem because it represents a stumbling block that keeps Greene's arguments from being persuasive to anyone who doesn't already share his conviction about the primacy of utilitarianism. Say I'm a devotee of Rawls and believe that the best metamorality is the one that protects the rights of individuals, even if it makes cooperation between moralities harder. Does it then matter to me that utilitarianism is the metamorality that enables the greatest cooperation? No. So Greene is effectively preaching to the choir.f) Finally, I can't help feeling that Greene's arguments don't really address an important class of moral dilemmas that involve situations where utilitarian comparisons are too unclear to be helpful. If we're comparing the utility of an expensive watch to the utility of a child's survival, then utilitarianism works well. But if we're comparing the utility of a five minute school prayer to believers vs. the utility of five minutes of free time to non-believers, the utilitarian implications are murky. And yet many of the most difficult moral problems we face are precisely problems where the maximizing overall utility guideline is not especially helpful.All that being said, I still think  Moral Tribes is one of the best books on questions of morality that I've read in a while - a book that offers insightful and important arguments that deserve careful consideration, and a book that anyone interested in these issues should read.

16,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,4,"I listened to this book as a follow up to Jonathan Haidt's excellent ""The Righteous Mind."" I didn't enjoy this book as much even though I probably would agree with Greene on more things than with Haidt. Haidt just had the advantage of going first and introducing me to the field of moral cognition. Greene is still a great read, and I recommend it to people even if they've already read Haidt.This book centers around the quest for a universal moral currency that can adjudicate disputes between moral tribes, or the communities that the modern world increasingly throws into contact and conflict with each other. The book starts with the concept of the tragedy of the commons. In order for any community to work together, they need to mitigate the tragedy of the commons. Morality, in this evolutionary sense, is essentially a set of rules designed to facilitate cooperation within a group. However, we also have evolved, automatic settings that police our behavior from within, making us cooperative in the in-group almost by nature. We blush, gossip, get angry at taboo violators, have awe for the principles and sacred objects of the group, etc., and these automatic responses bolster (and are the basis of) the more abstract rules of humanity. Groups need this in-group harmony to survive, and the better they are at cooperation the more likely they are to survive.So, the tragedy of the commons is solved! However, Greene says that this solution engenders its own new problem: the tragedy of common sense morality. When we meet other groups, we say ""Hey, you guys don't do things like we do! What the heck! Let's fight."" Each group's norms and values seem like ""common sense"" to the group, but they are nonsense (or worse) to the other group. Thus, Greene says we need a common language of morality For that common language, Greene proposes happiness. It's something that we all agree that human beings should want. Ideally, we can put aside our common sense moralities and figure out what make human beings the happiest. Greene is a utilitarian in the spirit of Mill and Bentham, but he has drawn out a much more sophisticated version of utilitarianism than what most people associate with that term. Utilitarianism seeks the greatest good for the greatest number, but it also treats everyone's happiness as equally valuable. Slavery, for example, is not justified in utilitarianism because it makes some people a little happier but others a lot less happy. Greene argues that our debates about our ways of life should be based around figuring out what makes people the happiest without taking too much from any individual or group. Strangely enough, this reminds me a lot of Fukuyama's argument that liberal democracy is best at satisfying the individual's ""struggle for recognition,"" dignity, and happiness.In order to do this, Greene argues that we will have to rely much more on manual-mode, conscious reasoning to figure out what makes people the happiest. At this point he builds heavily on Kahneman and Tversky's Systems 1 and 2 arguments. Our automatic settings are too focused on in-group cooperation and out-group distrust, and they have a lot of weird biases to be reliable guides to inter-group disputes. For example, in the trolley problem, our automatic response is that pushing the person is wrong but pulling the switch is okay, even though they are the same result! Utilitarianism focuses on the outcomes rather than the inputs of these processes, helping us get closer to what ways of life work best in cases where we have to decide (abortion or gay marriage, for instance). I like the Greene puts more credence in our ability to consciously reason, whereas Haidt is a bit heavy on the point that our reasoning is just post hoc rationalization of our instincts.One very interesting argument in this book is that the concept of rights aren't very good for settling tough inter-tribal disputes. Greene portrays rights as trumps: my right to speech, privacy, religion, etc trumps almost anything you can put against it. Rights claims are designed to end conversations about morality as final arbiters of what we can and can't do. However, in cases like abortion, rights-talk doesn't get us very far. One side says ""right to life"" and the other says ""right to choose,"" but Greene says we don't get very far from those competing claims. You are likely to agree with the one from the tribe you come from, after all. Instead, Greene says that the common currency of happiness can help adjudicate these disputes. He concludes that outlawing abortion reduces happiness, especially the burden put on women, much more than it improves the happiness of somewhat theoretical lives, given that there's no scientific way to decide when ""ensoulment"" occurs. This is the pro-choice utilitarian argument that goes around the rights impasse.Greene has a great section on why he's a liberal that successfully counters a lot of Haidt's arguments. Haidt argues that liberals have an impoverished moral palate. They are only sensitive to care/harm, fairness, and liberty arguments, whereas conservatives respond to these and other moral taste buds, including sanctity/defilement, authority/tradition, and loyalty. Haidt says that liberals have this problem because too many of their beliefs come from abstract moral reasoning, Enlightenment style, which is deeply disconnected from our social lives and evolutionary nature.Greene's counterpoint is great: This removal from the common sense morality of one's tribe, this ability to reason more abstractly, is the core strength of liberalism. Unlike virtually any other code, liberalism strives to be a form of universal moral currency by basing its judgements not on what any given tribe finds to be right or wrong, but more objective measurements of happiness like harm and fairness. Liberalism arose from theorists like Locke, Mill, Bentham, Rawls, and others who were trying to figure out how to live peacefully and cooperate with different tribes than there own. They couldn't just command those tribes (other religions, peoples, etc) to obey their common sense moralities, so they had to figure out common principles that both sides could agree to: rights, balanced government, tolerance, the harm principle, equality, and fairness. Social conservatism, in contrast, is in Greene's telling just a reflection of the common sense morality of each tribe. Do social conservatives value patriotism, sanctity, and tradition in the abstract, as Haidt claims? No: they value their own forms of patriotism, sanctity, and tradition. When Iranians rebel against their government, violating patriotism and respect for authority, American social conservatives rejoice. Social conservatives treat the traditions of other societies as wrong, weird, or sacrilegious, and, unlike liberal utilitarians, would never consider adopting those practices if they were proven to be more effective or better at generating happiness. If social conservatives value sanctity so much, why have so many of them been willing to desecrate the Qur'an, or support this kind of action? Why do they rejoice when Trump speaks of killing terrorists with bullets dipped in pigs blood? Social conservative movements operate from the common sense morality of ""how we do things is how everyone else should do things, and our preferences should win out when they come into conflict with other tribes."" This summarizes why Greene, and I, are liberals. I think we can see this point playing out right now in the great state of North Carolina.I have two main problems with this book. First, I think the argument about rights is overstated. Greene doesn't really deal with the social contract aspect of liberal thought, which actually approaches rights from a fairly utilitarian perspective as well. Second, the book is a bit scattershot in its organization, and it has a little more philosophy than I wanted. Still, I recommend it highly to everyone. Yes, everyone! Moral cognition is an expanding field of moral psychology, and it cuts through so much BS and explains so much of our behavior that we should all at least engage with it."
17,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5915062-duncan-mclaren,3,"For a book described in its jacket quotes as 'a landmark', 'brilliant' and 'a masterpiece', this was a big disappointment. It is no such thing, and that Steven Pinker and Peter Singer should make such comments about it is - I suspect - testament to the power of confirmation bias. So why I am I still awarding it 3 stars? Because it is in many ways two books woven into one, and one of the two books is indeed stimulating, challenging and innovative (sadly the other is almost entirely without logical foundation. Book one is the melding of psychological research and moral philosophy to demonstrate the ways in which differently evolved cultures have developed distinctive moral approaches which can be internally consistent, and yet generate conflicts in which each group (or 'tribe') believes itself morally correct. In doing this he contrasts the parable of 'the tragedy of commonsense morality' with the 'tragedy of the commons'. Greene's innovative approach is to weave together evidence on humans' two-speed brains (as elaborated in Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow') with evidence on how we approach moral dilemmas. The research findings he presents on how test subjects (albeit primarily weird (western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic) people) respond differently when triggered to use their gut reactions, rather than considered rationalism should provoke all philosophers to think hard about how far they are and should seek to 'justify their instincts'. Book two attempts (and imo, almost completely fails) to demonstrate that a variant of utilitarianism that Greene calls 'deep pragmatism' can provide a universal language and currency for negotiation and compromise between different 'moral tribes'. His quest fails on at least three counts. Most fundamentally he cannot escape the accusation he levies at almost all other philosophers - including such eminences as John Rawls - that he is seeking intricate ways to justify his own gut instincts. For instance his cultural setting means he largely fails to recognise the extent to which our biological and cultural evolution has not left humans as competitive savages with a veneer of collaborative culture, but as highly evolved collaborators with a healthy streak of competitiveness. Moreover, he redefines happiness or welfare (the underlying currency of utilitarianism) in ways that leave it almost meaningless (and certainly distinctive from other utilitarian scholars) - as including sacrifices on behalf of others, and over indefinite time periods. Worse he redefines the 'moral community' - by suggesting that anyone who doesn't get their happiness in the same way, is simply 'not part of the we in this conversation'.So ultimately Greene's effort to transcend moral differences through utilitarianism fails. But his book is still valuable as it illuminates important obstacles that will have to be overcome in any other effort to develop a universal ethical framework, whether based in human rights, cosmopolitanism or recognition, for example. But here lies what I see as Greene's final failure: in his determination to find in 'deep pragmatism' the one and only way to something approximating moral universalism; he becomes increasingly determined to rubbish any alternative approaches, and rather overlooks and demeans the massive progress made by non-utilitarian approaches which have incrementally widened the ambit of our moral community to increasingly accept differences in gender, ethnicity, nationality and sexuality. In this I think he is not only hampered by his own psychological blinkers, but the cultural blinkers of living in the current polarised era of US politics.Nonetheless, I neither regret reading this, nor would I do other than recommend it to others ... despite my criticisms, it made me think and reflect, and there is little more that we could reasonably ask from a book of such ambition that attempts to present both science and philosophy to a mainstream audience. "
18,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10098518-john,2,"Greene takes pains to source philosophy, social and cognitive sciences, psychology, and other material pertinent to having a reasoned conversation about why different groups of people can disagree about things each is so sure is moral and right[eous]. By chapter 5 he's plainly depicted the landscape of our biological proclivities, inherited perspectives, decision making, and biases. He's set upon that landscape metaphysical and reasoning tools with which you expect him to construct and reveal grand insight. Perhaps because of this groundwork, even more than the desire for understanding between the seemingly irreconcilable, Greene tragically disappoints the reader by repeatedly begging appeal for open-mindedness followed by what can only be described as half-assed, rushed, shoddy hand-waving rather than concerted (let alone rigorous) use of the tools he's laid out. No, the reader isn't left with insight beyond what a high school debate coach might give. They're left knowing Greene as a partisan hack, as convinced of his moral superiority as anyone else on the partisan spectrum. Summing Greene's position: Utilitarianism is the only means by which compromise can be attained. Though you may find Utilitarianism unworkable idealistic and its result morally reprehensible, this is simply because you've failed to use reason over emotion... ...or if you have used reason, because you've done so only to further rationalize your own position (something Greene provides heaping examples of in his own rhetoric). ""You see"", Greene says, ""disagreeing with Utilitarianism is ridiculous because it means forsaking the /deeply pragmatic/ compromise required of reason."" Wherein such a compromise demands judgement? These are precisely the situations in which one would turn to an expert... ...this expert just sticks his finger in the air and spouts the American Liberal line verbatim. "

Cool job title!He starts by arguing that many of our emotions developed as moral instincts designed to help individuals deal with society, addressing the ""tragedy of the commons"" problem.Next he points out that different societies can develop different workable tradeoffs: more or less indivuality, collectivity, etc. A higher level problem then arises when these societies collide: each has built up structures to help individuals cope with supporting intuitions, but these intuitions tell them that other societies are immoral.He then argues that we need to move beyond our intuitions to a meta-morality. By studying the mechanisms by which our moral intuitions function, we can use logical thinking (see Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman) to move beyond them. He proposes Utilitarian Philosophy as a framework for this meta-morality.I found his arguments fascinating, enlighting, and convincing. Your mileage may vary!"

21,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Greene places moral theory on a biological foundation. His focus is our tribal nature. It’s a point that Darwin covered in “The Descent of Man” and Greene brings this topic back to life. He argues that we are able to overcome our tribal morality that operates more or less automatically to merge us with our group, but not beyond. Greene argues for a utilitarian approach that involves (following a camera metaphor) “manual control” where we intentionally direct our behavior to promote the happiness of all. He calls a transcendent principle to “maximize happiness impartially” a “metamorality.” If “all else is equal,” he states, “we prefer to increase the total amount of happiness across people.”  The weakness of this argument is his assertion that we care about the happiness of all. For everyone who is as Greene states (who with prompting can overcome their tribal propensities), there are others who are indifferent or who seek to promote their own advantage at the other’s expense if they can get away with it (via deception, manipulation, overpowering). Both work as survival strategies and we see these poles of human behavior and everything in between. Darwin’s theory rests on variation. Animals differ in “personality” and “disposition” and there’s no reason why variation in us should not apply to our behavioral propensities as well as our obvious physical differences.  A second problem is that opposing positions (group vs. group; tribe vs. tribe) are in Greene's view reconciled by a pragmatic assessment of the evidence. Greene refers to himself as a member of a liberal “meta tribe” that follows a deep pragmatist-utilitarian ethic to make the world “a happier place” for everyone. “Why,” he asks, “would we ever want to make the world less happy than it could otherwise be?” Greene then applies his ethic to the abortion debate and comes out with a pro-choice stance based on reasoned evidence. But that’s not the way it works. Former Senator Santorum speaks for the “anti-abortion tribe” whose happiness is inherently at odds with the pro-choice position. While public debate can enlighten and bring some people together,* Haidt is right: in the end, moral judgments are about values and emotion-based orientations. Most often, we do values, not facts. Greene’s moral prescription also tends to leave the body behind. Greene argues that we can become a “global tribe that looks out for its members, not to gain advantage over others, but simply because it’s good.” He wants to move from the moral feeling of the heart to the thinking morality of the brain. But that’s an artificial separation. Thinking per se motivates nothing unless it taps into something inside that cares. We don’t leave emotion behind as he suggests. Consciousness helps us to see when our broader interests are involved.** An alternative perspective is to tie moral behavior back to the self’s interest, either because we identify with the situation of others (we naturally “care”) or because we see, pragmatically, that our interest is tied up with the interest of others. To be fair to Greene, he may be making the same argument about the need to respect the interests of everyone. But he sees the sole motivating factor as a “care” for the happiness of others. While a good many do care in the way that Greene sees, a good many do not. They can, though, be persuaded to transcend their personal or group-centric interests if they see them tied up, as Hobbes argued, in the interests of the greater whole.*** Yet, even so, there are the hard-core ego- or group-centric people who see the world only in “us” vs. “them” terms.**** And this is where counter-power (state, group, individual), as opposed to reasoned persuasion, must be used to protect the interest of the whole. As a final point, Greene’s account of the origins of cooperation strikes me as suspect. He argues that morality evolved as a solution to the problem surrounding intergroup competition for resources (he repeatedly uses the tragedy of the commons example). In doing so, and despite his repeated disavowals, he lapses close to Darwin’s largely discredited notion of group selection when he states that cooperation evolved for “successful intergroup competition.” But differential reproductive success need not involve competitive pressures with other groups. The challenges faced in the early hominid line were survival from whatever source, not just competing groups, and the individual’s chances of success depended on being a member of a group in good standing rather than isolated and alone. Following Dawkins’s extended phenotype notion, it could be that the group is an extension of the individual’s self-interest and, as Darwin argued, the social instincts evolved to ensure merger and solidarity with a group. *“[O]ur strategy should not be to compromise with tribal moralists, but rather to persuade them to be less tribalistic,” Greene writes.** For Daniel Kahneman (2011) and, earlier Joseph LeDoux (1996), mind and emotion work together and, more accurately stated, mind serves the interest of the passions (per Hume) by, in part, placing a broader context around our interests. As opposed to one replacing the other, Kahneman integrates reason (his System 2) with emotion (his System 1).  *** Greene dismisses the capacity of science to establish moral truths. Yet, as with medicine where the doctor prescribes for health, here it is, staring us in the face. It’s a deductive logic based on biological survival and well-being: if everyone acts without regard for the interests of the other, than we all suffer. The extension of this logic is to insist on respect for the rule of impartiality and the golden rule in making and enforcing laws that govern intra- and intergroup behavior.****Greene writes that “Evolution might favor people who are nice to their neighbors, but it might also favor people with genocidal tendencies….” and “Today we know that natural selection can promote nice behavior as well as nasty behavior…” Greene is referring to the downside of tribal morality, but these statements, stated in this hard-core way, work against his argument that, with reasoned prompting, we can be persuaded to care for the happiness of those outside our tribe.

22,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Brilliant! Every time I read something of Josh Greene's, I love him more. He provides some of the most exciting aspects neuroscience has to offer. Malcolm Gladwell is very popular, but people who majored in neuroscience and those practicing in the field find him frustrating because he promotes sexy science (that is just how researchers refer to neuroscience because of how it has been portrayed in the media) at the expense of actual, solid, careful science. But, Josh Greene provides all the sexy-sci while also not compromising the quality of the science. I recommend not only reading Greene's book, but also watching his talks. I had the chance to see him years ago when he was completing his work on the emotional and logical parts of the prefrontal cortex that battle it out to come to one fluid moral decision. His work in this area is absolutely spectacular. He was also working, at that time, on distance v. local empathy, which I was happy to see as a focus in this book. With his work, he helped neuroscientists answer some deep and unanswered questions. Throughout his career, Greene has conducted brain imaging studies and questionnaires (with awesomely quirky questions and scenarios) in an effort to understand how people react differently within and between cultures. Are there universal behaviors or behaviors that more likely exist in all people? Do some cultures share similar ideologies? Are there key differences? How do the similarities and differences play out on a local and global scale? After examining his findings, he provides excellent explanations for how people come to form their moral decisions. Unlike so many researchers in similar fields, Greene avoids telling too many ""just so"" stories. It's not that he doesn't engage in the just-so-story thinking, but he keeps it to a minimum and seems to use the science in a more cautious way. Greene used Daniel Kahneman's work on heuristics as a foundation for his own studies. Greene wants to know, not only how our gut reactions can fail us, but do they fail us in different ways if we are from different cultures? Some cultures are more trusting in general. Some cultures are less so. What does this mean for any standard of trust? Should we trust? Shouldn't we trust? Is there an optimal level of trust that allows us to be open but not be vulnerable to a predator? These are great questions. Of course the reader will encounter his well used trolly dilemma. In addition to trolleyology Greene attempted to understand how people come to make (and keep or discard) ideas about climate change, abortion, politics, charity, and other moral aspects of the world. How does your local tribe (be it your political affiliation, religious affiliation, or the affiliation you have with the particular country in which you happen to live) affect what you think about issues in your local community and global concerns. Do people employ utilitarianism, or deep pragmatism as he likes to call it? His conclusions are extremely thought provoking. Is there an ""ought"" to which we should subscribe? If things ""are"", does that mean they ""ought"" (""is v ought problem"") to be that way? How can we ever decide on any optimal moral decision making? If we want what is best for all, how can we make sure ""all"" really means *all*? This makes me think about the social contract and constitution, which assumed that humans had inalienable rights, but humans failed to include black humans. They were not included in the ""all."" It is important to think about who is not included in an of our ""all"" when using deep pragmatism. It's often much easier to save a life than to save many lives. It is also easier to not help when humans are farther away from the problem. Greene forces the reader to examine some of their own silly ideas that lead to these phenomena, e.g. a child is dying but I won't save it because I value my expensive suit and don't want to ruin it vs. the person who sits at home and watches a child starve to death but doesn't donate so they can buy an expensive suit. In the end, it seems to Greene that gut reactions are ok for local decision making but to make global decisions that are best for all, we need to overcome the heuristically-driven gut reactions to make more pragmatic decisions. "
23,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"I really wanted to like this book a lot, because it is aiming at a very important question, and the author has done his research. Unfortunately, just because you have the right weapon and the right target, doesn't mean you hit the mark.The target, in this case, is what happens when numerous tribes whose morality systems (largely intuitive), which work fine within their own societies, impinge upon each other (as with globalization).The weapon, is all the science that's been done in the last 20 years about how the human brain thinks about moral issues. We know orders of magnitude more about this than when, for example, Mill and Kant and Bentham and others thought about this several centuries ago. We have testable predictions about what changes people's opinions on moral issues, and how the different parts of the human brain interact with each other and with culture to produce our moral responses to things like violence, selfishness, novelty, sex, and so forth. Greene's overview of this is actually quite good, and anyone who isn't aware of all of this research would do well to start with this book as a survey.The problem is that, armed with this and a meta-morality that Greene calls ""deep pragmatism"", a kind of modernized utilitarianism, he then attempts to determine whether we can find a better way to resolve moral disputes between ""tribes"". The theory is that, since our instincts and intuitions are irreconcilably different, only an appeal to conscious reason (informed by scientific facts) can offer a way out of the morass (besides just fighting it out, of course).So far, so plausible, but the conclusions that Greene arrives at look suspiciously identical to the typical liberal-with-a-dash-of-libertarianism that 90% of all academics arrive at by following their instincts. The low point is probably when, in a discussion of abortion, he pronounces the conservative argument as ""too good"", and settles conveniently on the only conclusion that would not have alienated his peers.It's not so much even his conclusions that I disagree with, though I disagree occasionally, it's rather the idea he has that anyone who doesn't already agree with them will be convinced by his argument any more than the quicker, and in some ways more honest, assertion of one's position as being morally right and beyond question.In many ways it reminds me of Daniel Dennett's attempts to appear that he was considering religious views in a dispassionate way in ""Breaking the Spell"". No one who wasn't already convinced, will be convinced. If I found it to be biased and headed towards a predetermined conclusion, surely no religious and/or conservative reader will do otherwise.In Greene's case, though, he is at least shining a light on the right question, and as mentioned earlier providing a pretty good survey of the relevant science of the last 20 years. Good. But not great, and not up to the task he seems to set himself. "
24,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1412896-stephanie,5,"Really, really excellent—though challenging in parts. This book follows closely on the heels of three other social-science screeds it cites heavily: Jonathan Haidt's ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion,"" Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast & Slow,"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,"" all of which I've read and highly recommend. Greene's main assertion is that our moral instincts are pretty good at keeping us in line when it comes to questions of Me vs. Us, but is remarkably bad at handing conflict between Us and Them. Your brain (if it's healthy) has built in measures to stop you from cheating on your taxes or your spouse, from killing or wantonly hurting people, and from being a bastard generally. This old, evolved part of your brain encourages you to cooperate with members of your tribe, because when your tribe is harmonious, you are better able to defend yourself against Them. It doesn't always work, which is why we still have bastards, but it works pretty well most of the time. What our moral instincts don't give us, however, is an easy way to cooperate among tribes. We can put Us before Me, and stop being selfish, but we have a much harder time with Us vs. Them. All our instincts tell us, when there's a conflict between tribes, to kick the other tribe's ass. (A ""tribe"" here is any group with which you share a team spirit of some kind and to which you are loyal: liberals, conservatives, Palestinians, Jews, Packers, Giants, etc.) You are likely to remain ideologically loyal to your team even when your team is demonstrably, scientifically, clearly wrong in some way, and you are likely to see the a conflicting team as an enemy even when they are right about something. Loyalty trumps reason.But reason can be re-engaged by putting the brain in manual mode, he says. Most of the book focuses on how to get the brain into that state, focused on the specific task of finding a utilitarian solution to the us vs. them controversy at hand.To read my full review, go here and scroll down: http://stephstuph.blogspot.com/2014/0..."
25,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27586154-zach-toad,5,"Joshua Greene has left us a book that has played a pivotal role in solidifying my thoughts on morality, but more importantly, a book that will actually compel me to live differently and more confidently share my newly solidified philosophy with others. Greene's book is so good not because it is original, genius, insightful, fresh, nor extraordinarily well-argued and researched (though it is all of these things), but rather because it is simply correct. Greene uses the latest research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the misguided adventure that moral philosophy has taken us on since Plato. We have been searching for a morality that both ""feels right"" and is amenable to and consistent with rigorous logical and rational scrutiny. But, as Greene puts it, it would be quite a coincidence if our brains evolved in such a way that all of our (emotionally driven) moral intuitions could be neatly categorized into a consistent philosophical framework. We have evolved automatic programs - emotions - that guide us into cooperating with our neighbors. This cooperation is evolutionarily advantageous - think: ant colony. These emotions, however, are not designed to promote cooperation in our complex global society, whose advent is far too nascent for evolutionary pressures to have had any effect. Our moral emotions, thus, should serve as guides to behavior only when we are dealing with intra-group, tragedy-of-the-commons, ""me versus us” conflicts. If you feel guilty for stealing, your emotional machinery is doing exactly what it should do: heed your feelings and return that bike! On the other hand, if we are dealing on the the inter-group, ""us versus them,"" societal or global level of affairs, our moral emotions, compounded with ""fairness bias,"" cannot and should not be trusted. Here, we need to switch into ""manual mode"" and use utilitarian principles to impartially determine which policies will lead to the most overall happiness in the world. But stop, you say, utilitarianism! What kind of dystopian, calculating, hedonistic moral philosophy are you purporting? It's the good old fashioned, Jeremy-Bentham-John-Stuart-Mill variety that, really, bears little resemblance to the misunderstood popular conception. In fact, I agree with Greene that utilitarianism is the only moral philosophy that makes sense, the only one that we can use as a ""common currency"" for resolving inter-group strife, and the only one that aligns with Greene and Co.'s recent findings in brain science. I'll first start by explaining that morality has to be linked to human experience. There are no values in universes void of consciousness. As Sam Harris says, we have no moral obligations to rocks, but only to other conscious creatures. Where else could morality reasonably come from? Deontology and virtue ethics offer no good answer. Second, Greene shows why the common thought experiments used to discredit utilitarianism are unfair. Most of the book examines the trolley dilemma: Would you push one man in front of a moving trolley in order to save five? We instinctively cringe at the thought. But Greene explains that in the philosophical, abstract realm we can use thought experiments to pit our deeply held instinctual moral convictions against our weaker rational drives. It is no wonder, then, that we can find utilitarianism repugnant in a few deeply contrived situations that could almost certainly never be realized in the real world. Should we endorse a system of slavery that turns only 10% of citizens into property but makes 90% of the population blissfully happy? In the abstract, Greene implicitly says yes, but such a system's costs would never outweigh the benefits, given human nature and the way the real world works (including the way human brains work). Should a doctor save five organ-transplant-needing patients by killing a healthy man and using his organs to save the five? Greene, also implicitly, endorses a form of rule-utilitarianism in which the answer is in the negative because such an organ-transplanting policy would not result in the most mental utility, or happiness, or however you want to put it. Utilitarianism, on a separate note, is often cited as requiring too much of its moral agents. We would need to live absurdly selfless lives in order to produce the most good in the world. In one sense, this might be true. But Greene aptly counters by appealing to the fact that we are only human. Thus, living balanced lives, leading by reasonable example, and working within our “species-typical moral limitations” would actually result in the greatest good for all. That is, at least, until we can genetically engineer away our “species-typical moral limitations.” My favorite part of the book, however, is Greene’s attack on the political rhetoric of rights. We can make no real sense of rights and duties, he argues, other than that they are simply formal ways of describing what certain groups ‘feel’ to be unquestionable paths to ‘justice.’ Such groups have no evidence, argument, or proof of the existence of such entities, and when people toss the rights rhetoric around they are not advancing the debate, they are closed to evidence, and they are maintaining a biased commitment to their own tribe. Only should we speak of rights, Greene admonishes, when the matter is settled (e.g. slavery). I’ve long had suspicions of these ideas, but Greene really drove them home for me. Despite my glowing remarks and approval above, the book is not without its problems. I’d like to first address, and attempt to counter one of the problems raised by Thomas Nagel in his review of the book for New Republic. Nagel says:	“The most difficult problem posed by Greene’s proposals is whether we should give up trying to understand our natural moral intuitions as evidence of a coherent system of individual rights that limit what may be done even in pursuit of the greater good. Should we instead come to regard them as we regard optical illusions, recognizing them as evolutionary products but withholding our assent? Greene’s debunking arguments add an empirical dimension to a venerable utilitarian tradition, but they certainly do not settle the question. It is possible to defend a universal system of individual rights as the expression of a moral point of view that accords to each individual a sphere of autonomy in the conduct of life, free from interference by others, defined in such a way that the same sphere of autonomy can be accorded to everyone without inconsistency. This last condition means that sometimes the distinction between what does and does not count as a crossing of the boundary protected by rights may seem arbitrary—as in the distinction between “footbridge” and “switch,” or between killing someone (strongly prohibited) and failing to save someone from death (permitted, unless it costs you very little). But the moral conception behind a system that embodies such distinctions cannot easily be dismissed as the equivalent of an optical illusion. Most people will regard a morality based entirely on such a system of equal liberty as unacceptable, but it can also be included, along with some requirements of impartial concern for the general welfare, as part of a more complicated morality that reflects the complexity of human nature.” I like this quote from Nagel, but I think he might be right. But I want to point out something about utilitarianism that could be taken as one of its strengths or flaws, that seems to undermine Nagel’s point. What Nagel seems to be overlooking here is that utilitarianism could be defined and delineated in such a way that it accommodates his “universal system of individual rights.” He may be right that a consistent system of spheres of autonomy could be developed and accorded to everyone. But utilitarianism, or the most happiness for all, could still be pointed out as the foundation for this framework. I think we are right to proceed with caution here — there is something fishy about a moral system that can be revised and redefined so as to accommodate or subsume any other moral framework. I have to admit here, that utilitarianism seems very slippery. It seems exactly like the kind of theories Popper argued against, theories that are unfalsifiable. But, I think, at bottom, a moral system that claims rights as entities independent of the well-being of conscious creatures is fundamentally flawed. There is no good or bad apart from conscious experience. There are some other interesting problems that arise in adopting utilitarianism. For one, assuming a level of general well-being for all minds: is more consciousness better? That is, is it good and favorable and moral to bring more babies into the world? Greene endorses this view at one point in his book, but my thoughts on it aren’t yet finished. Another interesting problem is that of Socrates and the pig. Utilitarians, Greene included, claim that there are so-called “higher pleasures” and that it is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. I’m wondering if this assertion goes against the principle of impartiality that plays so vital a role in Greene’s theory. Certainly, there are some people who appreciate and enjoy particular things on a deeper level than others. Is their pleasure more valuable than that of others? What if there are some people whose experience of the world is much richer than that of others, in a way analogous to, but not quite as exaggerated as, the relationship between Socrates and the pig? The principle of impartiality does not seem to follow from these reflections. On a more personal note, I am excited to have found some new ways to dig my political philosophy out of the libertarian trenches it has inhabited since college. I can no longer be a stark defender of property rights if I am a full-fledged utilitarian. Greene ends the book by urging his readers to give in reasonable amounts. His arguments are compelling. But they raise another question/problem: couldn’t his entire framework, utilitarianism, be used to argue for conservative economic policies if only the conservatives point to the data, if there is any, on how giving doesn’t lead to the most good? How giving on a massive scale like welfare is actually oppressing the poor? How could we even test for something like this? Here we see a different sort of slipperiness of this system: is the world too complex to be analyzed through utilitarian eyes? Yes there might be an ultimate answer to what leads to the most pleasure for all the brains in the world, but is that information forever beyond our empirical grasp? Here is a great review in the Atlantic which diagnosis the problem of “common sense morality” a little bit differently than Greene. The solution is more about developing self-awareness than converting people to utilitarianism, but I think the author downplays the correlation between the two. http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/a....TLDR: This is an amazing, near-revolutionary book that would make the world a much better place if everyone read it and understood it. I genuinely believe that its pages contain some of the key answers we need to avoid a human-caused apocalypse and promote the continued flourishing of our species into the distant future. "
26,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5936756-simon-lavoie,5,"Joshua Greene claims that neuroscience « can improve our prospects for peace and prosperity by improving the way we think about moral problems » (p.13); that moral cognitive psychology is a valuable means to revive the Enlightenment's metamorality project, along the utilitarianist/consequentialist (or else, Deep Pragmatist) line. Our dual-mode processing brains work against the odds of ever attaining a moral philosophy that would be fully consistent with feelings. Using evidences of the game theory type (the Ultimatum Games, the Public Good Games, and Dictator Games) and using other experimental devices as well, Greene both shows (i) what automatic, efficient but inflexible cognitive machinery is at work when motivating and stabilizing cooperation, punishing cheaters and free-riders, is at stake, and (ii) how tribalistic-minded these mechanisms make us think (favoring follow group members by biasing our fairness, our perception, and information processing). Morality and cooperation have not evolved because of their niceness, but for their competitive advantages at the groupal level (whether this claim can be hold without endorsing group selection is not self-evident- albeit Greene's claims to the contrary). It is arguably hard to figure out another way (a non-competitive way) it could have evolved. Hence, the same type 1 thinking that enables us to get along in one moral group (thanks to senses of empathy, loyalty, guilt, shame, vengefulness, and the like) fails us when we have to settle inter-groups, inter-tribes clashes, with different values, with different authoritative traditions and texts. But, as Greene forcefully states, morality is more than what it evolved to be or do. Morality can kick the evolutionary ladder. Knowing how our gut feelings, while good and reliable in certain circumstances, are unreliable in some other, is one way that neuroscience can contribute to upgrade our ways to the new challenges of living with other morals groups. In this regard, the many variants of the trolley dilemmas that Greene has crafted during his doctoral days are instructive of how module-myopic our feelings about harms are. In short : many morally relevant distinctions (means/side-effect; doing/allowing) are likely by-products of our cognitive action-plan reader's design, which is all about a single causal-chain of events (killing one person as a means to save five feels horribly wrong if it happens by the use of personal force on the main causal chains of events, but it feels less so if it happens trough activating a switch which displace the arm - on a secondary causal-chain of events). Greene states we have to rely on the right thinking process to address the right type of problem. Explicit reasoning has to take over the gut feelings (justification or rationalization of these included) on what he called The New Pastures.The rights talks will not do. Claiming rights are killing the thinking and the argument. Far for enticing us to reflect and debate, rights are merely just a way to give our gut feelings an objective, transcendental status, as if our gut feelings were authorative 'things out there'. Given we have no self-evident first principle to create a fully consistent moral and legal theory, we have no way to tell in advance what rights truly exist, and which has to take precedence over the other. The way Greene gets our thinking beyond the right bluffs is, in itself, truly worth the read.  Overall, Greene's innovative merging of different neuroscientific insights is strong on all of his theoretical subgoals. Coming from cultural anthropology, I first felt his proposal to step outside our cultural, moral views to engage in a metamoral thinking was suspicious. But Greene is well aware of this problem and his way to clarifiy utilitarianism and to answer critics is, I think, sound enough to be taken and espoused seriously. Utility and wealth are no synonyms. Despite the fact utilitarian's adversaries (starting with Rawls) admit of utility and wealth to be distinct, their critics only make sense when both are treated the same way, along the same ""declining marginal utility"" way (that holds for wealth only).  Maximize happiness impartially  seems a good start and a promising way to cut across moral-cultural divides, provided we do as Greene invites us to, in following the utilitarian inquiry down to our more cherished, ground values. While rights-talk are unaccountable to evidences, and while the push toward justifiying and rationalizing our choices based on gut feelings only push us farther from common ground (or common currency), utility is accountable to empirical enquiry (the consequences of policies on our experience, whether these consequences be improving or decreasing our happiness, is measurable in a relatively accurate way). Greene's down-to-earth, practical proposal could move the political agenda in the right direction, beginning by setting the presidential and other like-minded debates under a new constraint that is more conducive of modesty and agremment. Agents that are expected to justify their position and claims only tear themselves farther and farther from any common ground; while agents expected to explain how and why their proposals in matter of policy or else are to work and bring about more happiness often must ackowledge, in a Socratic way, how imperfect and incomplete their knowledges are. Getting along with others is easier done when cast in the mind of having each others contributing and enlarging our knowledge and beliefs; it is way harder for self-proclaimed thruth-holders. Stop justify and boast yourself; start explain and realize you don't know that much (Greene's recast of the abortion debates in that light is instructive).This book was greatly appraised for it giving fresh air to both moral philosophy and moral psychology, and it is still a great read. However, one negative remark to end this review : Greene takes the prisoner's dilemma as depicting the same cooperative challenges our moral brains evolved to solve, namely, The Tragedy of the Common (the tragedy of selfishness). « Despite the criminal context, the abstract principle behind the Prisoner's Dilemma explain why our moral brains are the way they are » (p.28). I think one can get a better, more relevant picture to account for morality and cooperation's evolutionary origins. The prisoner's dilemma main weakness is to rely on one-sided, one-dimensional agents (they know and act together as robber, maybe not now but in the future, only, and in no other way). I prefer Tomasello's 2016 (A Natural History of Human Morality hypothesis that social creatures has manifold stakes in each others (as procreative partners, as a alarm callers, coalition parners, grooming friends etc.). These many stakes can account for why they sometimes act altruistically with feelings of sympathy, without having to expect a specific giving-back by the recipients. The following enlargement of perspective renders the evolutionary ubgring of genuine (not instrumental and opportunistic) morality more likely than does the prisoner's one sidedness. I also think Tomasello (following Hume) got things better than Greene when he stresses that the cognitive appraisal of inter-dependence, and the sense of equality among inter-dependent partners, have bosltered both moral and cooperative skills in our species. More precisely, cognitive appraisal of inter-dependence, with relevant behavior selection and monitoring, give way to a new cooperative rationality that has that powerful explanatory power (for our normative, perspectice-taking, thinking), which Greene seems to lack in some regards."
27,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.Essentially, this book is about getting past partisan divides and trying to find some kind of objective overarching morality that everyone can apply and understand, a “metamorality”. For Greene, the answer is very clearly utilitarianism, and he makes a spirited defence of that point, countering many of the standard objections to utilitarianism and clearing away the misconceptions. He starts by defining the problem, of course: discussing how we make moral decisions, using trolley problems (“trolleyology”) as the “fruit fly” of morality experiments.He talks about ideas you’ve probably read elsewhere, sounding very much like Jonathan Haidt’s “rational tail wagging the emotional dog”, and talks about the basis of this in the human brain. There’s a lot of unpicking of why we have two levels of response to moral situations, and when each one comes into play, which is fascinating in itself, but not new to me. The defence of utilitarianism was, for me, the important part of the book. I’ve always had a bit of a kneejerk reaction against it, and Greene does a good job of dissecting why that happens, and countering that perception.He also has some very good discussion of how to balance the ultimate aims of utilitarianism with being a fallible human being with emotional wants that feel like needs (even in cases where they’re not).Overall, worth the read, and I do think he has a good solution here for a system of metamorality that isn’t perfect (he doesn’t seem to think a perfect metamorality exists or is possible), but can be applied and understood by everyone, and which serves our needs for 99.999% of our problems in the real world."

29,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary,4,"I'm not sure where this book recommendation came from but I'm glad it popped up on my radar. Despite my high rating, I'll admit to feeling like I needed to force myself through parts of this book. It isn't too challenging of a read but (and the author admits this) some chapters dive a bit deeper into responding to arguments against the philosophy the author is promoting.The book demonstrates that solving moral dilemmas between ""Me"" and ""Us"" (you and your group or tribe) requires different thinking than solving dilemmas between ""Us"" and ""Them"" (your group and another group). Not only does it require different thinking but the thinking that works in ""Me"" vs ""Us"" fails when used for ""Us"" vs ""Them"". This is captured in this quote from the book: ""They fight not because they are fundamentally selfish but because they have incompatible visions of what a moral society should be.""Much of this book is dedicated towards showing the usefulness of utilitarianism as a philosophy for navigating the dilemmas that come out of intergroup conflicts. The book defends utilitarianism from the compelling arguments against it.Joshua Greene pulls together information from previously published works and studies to make a compelling read. The book touches on many subjects and at times goes off on slight tangents. I enjoyed his arguments against using Rights (example: right to life, right to choose) as reasonable parts of a convincing argument.In no particular order, here are some quick summaries of things I found interesting enough to make a note of while reading the book. There were definitely more interesting things in the book than these, I'm just terrible about jotting down notes.- Study asked Americans to consider six controversial policy proposals (example: single-payer healthcare) and asked for opinions about policies and an indication of how well they understood them. Then they asked the participants to explain in detail how the policies are supposed to work. Then they asked for the participant's opinion and indication of how well they understood the policies. After having to explain how the policies are supposed to work, participants downgraded their estimates of their own understanding and became more moderate in their opinions. A control group was only asked to provide reasons for their opinions. Follow up questions with control group after asking for reasons for opinions showed their strong opinions were intact.- Donations to determined cause (example: feeding a specific hungry child) are larger than donations to a cause (example: feeding hungry children). The difference between the determined case and the general case does not have to be large to notice a difference (studies have shown going from one to two even dampens assistance)- Experiment in the 1970s sent an attractive female experimenter to intercept men crossing two bridges. One bridge was wobbly and frightening. The other was sturdy and closer to ground. Attractive experimenter interviewed the stopped men (one a time) and gave them her phone number, in case they wanted to learn more about the study. The men from the wobbly bridge were far more likely to call her back and more likely to ask her out. As predicted, the fast heart rate and sweaty palms caused by the wobbly bridge were mistaken for feelings of attraction. ""The lesson: When we don’t know why we feel as we do, we make up a plausible-sounding story and go with it.""- Identifying as a conservative or liberal is a better predictor of a person's perceived risk of climate change than that person's degree of scientific literacy and numeracy.Here are some links to other reviews worth reading:onetwothree"
30,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3322582-james,4,"Just by chance, and not through any intention of my own, I feel that this is the third book in a trilogy of books I have read on morality. It started with Richard Dawkins’ “Selfish Gene where Dawkins, as a zoologist, explained altruism (aka morality) as an emergent behavior of the selfish nature of our genes (the nature of the genes themselves, not necessarily the selfish nature of the vehicle or animal they inhabit). I then read “The Righteous Mind” by Jonathan Haidt which took Dawkins’ thoughts to the next level up into the realm of evolutionary psychology and really explained how moral psychology works, that is he explained not necessarily “what” is right and wrong but “why” we think certain things are right and wrong. This final book, Moral Tribes, is a bit of a response to “The RIghteous Mind” (directly addressing the former in one of the final chapters) by introducing a bit of philosophy to the discussion and attempting to create a “meta-morality” for resolving differences between different groups’ ideas of morality.All three books are excellent and extremely challenging. I would argue that Selfish Gene is required reading before getting into the other two books. It is by far the most technical of the books but it really lays down a foundation of how things like the theory of evolution and the processes introduced by game theory can explain things like moral psychology. Dawkins’ book is by far the most “factual” (although it is Dawkins so he does get his opinions in there) and with that the most educational for me.“Moral Tribes” characterizes “The Righteous Mind” as making the case that the morality between, say, conservatives and liberals has a “ying and yang” type of relationship between them. That each side has their positives and negatives and we just need to understand one another’s perspective. And I totally agree with that characterization. It really felt that Haidt was going into the book trying to find a balance and a peace between the two side regardless if there are any facts to the contrary. So I found Moral Tribes more refreshing in that he acknowledged that one side can definitely be wrong and that there is an imperative to work towards figuring that out. I didn’t think his case for which side was the “best” was the strongest and that it tipped his hand a bit to reveal his biases, but I appreciated the move away from the moral relativism that Haidt seemed to be dancing around.Greene’s political leanings, while apparent through the entire book, was not really the focus of the book until the final chapters (and even then they were presented as more of an example of how he applies this “meta-morality” of utilitarianism). The focus of the book was to explain his “dual-process” modes of moral psychology and how “utilitarianism” (or “deep pragmatism” as he later calls it and what I wish he had called it throughout the book) best utilises this feature of how our mind seems to work. The analogy he used was comparing us to digital cameras. Cameras have automatic settings such as portrait modes or scenic landscape modes and they have manual modes in which we adjust the settings ourselves. That we have our automatic and emotional responses to moral issues but we can also switch to a more intellectual response, reasoning our way through the moral landscape. He uses a number of philosophical moral dilemmas in a variety of psychological studies in order to really map out how our moral psychology works.All in all it was an excellent read. In trying to patch up some of Haidt’s holes in his book he does create some of his own, but I am not sure that any book on morality should ever be considered to provide the perfect answer. Moral psychology is a journey, not necessarily a destination, and I thoroughly enjoyed this leg."
31,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10909889-pete-welter,5,"Making decisions that affect people or groups with different world views has always been challenging, but in our increasingly polarized culture, the topic becomes even more relevant. Given two groups of people with different moralities - such as different religions, or individualist vs. communal - how can we make decisions that all of us can live with, and in fact, thrive with?Joshua Greene brings his expertise in both philosophy and psychology to this discussion. If you enjoyed Thinking, Fast and Slow then this book brings that approach to morality. The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion covers similar ground (and is referenced in several place in this book), but reaches somewhat different conclusions. Both are excellent companion reads to ""Moral Tribes.""The essence of Greene's argument is that we have used our fast brain to serve us well to solve moral problems of selfishness vs. cooperation (""fast' being Kahneman's terminology for our ""automatic"" mode of thinking, as in ""Blink""). However, when it comes to resolving issues between groups (our ""tribes"") the moral intuitions of our fast brain yield less-useful results, often impasses as groups talk past each other. By understanding when to engage our ""slow"" brains, the more analytical side of ourselves, we can elevate the discussion above the gut-level moral intuitions to a point where reasoning can be applied to the problem. It's not that easy though. Many of our moral instincts, vocabulary and concepts are generated, one way or another, from the fast side. To add to this problem, we have all of the biases and blindnesses that evolution gave our brain. For example, we nearly always think we understand an issue much more than we actually do - and when we are forced (or force ourselves) to go back to try to gain a deeper understanding, extreme views nearly always move towards moderation.Greene carefully lays the groundwork for his arguments, based on a plethora of research by himself and others, and has an excellent bibliography and notes that include citations for some of the key papers in fields related to moral psychology. The thrust is to let you understand the philosophy of ""utilitarianism"" and how it applies to solving moral dilemmas and conflicts. With the understanding that no person is more entitled to happiness than anyone else, how can we find solutions that increase everyone's happiness? (or at least minimize the misery). How can we move arguments from intuitive emotions to a basis where we can leverage reasoning and above all, evidence, to point us in the right direction?This book will change the way I approach talking with others who I disagree with, both from forcing myself to reflect on my own views using Greene's framework and to trying to understand why others think the way they do. I came away with a deeper understanding of where I have been intellectually lazy in thinking about complex problems, and what I might do to become a better thinker and communicator in the future.I would recommend it to anyone wanting to understand why we think about morality the way we do, whether you end up buying all of Greene's utilitarianist approach or not. (NOTE: For my other non-fiction reviews, I generally give 5 stars to books that significantly change my understanding or view of the world. That doesn't mean they are page-turners, or that they will impact everyone the same way.)"
32,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,5,"Hard to say for sure so early into 2014, but this already looks promising as best book of the year.Starts off as a straightforward description of the evolution of our moral sense to emphasize within group cooperation and between group competition. For those who haven't encountered this before, Greene's explanation is as good as any I've read. He goes the extra step though, by introducing via metaphor the basic ideas behind the different major flavors of morality, notably conservative vs. liberal attitudes. I can only speak as a liberal, but to me it seems he's quite fair to both sides, and honestly I think any reader should be able to recognize him or herself in the metaphor.Anyway, he then proceeds to the major thrust of the book, which is to propose and defend a meta-morality to be used when judging the merits of different group-centric moral systems. His candidate for this meta-morality is utilitarianism, and much of the book is an excellent explanation of what exactly this philosophy is, and what it is not.The trolley problem in its numerous variations is used extensively, initially to explain utilitarianism, then to survey arguments against it, and finally to address those arguments.The most fascinating part of the book for me was where Greene teases apart the separate but intertwined mental mechanisms that explain people's reactions to trolley problems - and this step is critical to address the perceived shortcomings of utilitarianism in practice.Interesting to note that in its defense of utilitarianism, this book parallels the argument presented in Harris's The Moral Landscape, butGreene effectively softens some of the more absolute conclusions that would seem to follow from that book, and he explains in a footnote that he's not convinced that Harris has made the case that science can be used to determine moral values. I liked the Harris book but also was unconvinced - I think one difference is that Greene recognizes the reader's intuitions about morality and understands that if his conclusions are not in sync with them, he is obligated to explain why. In fact, Greene might be a good candidate to respond to Harris's challenge: http://m.samharris.org/blog/item/the-...Greene's writing is clear and entertaining, and fans of Pinker or Kurzban should enjoy this book - and yes, the dropping of those two names tells you that this book is another solid point in favor of evolutionary psychology as a powerful explanatory field, in spite of what some critics may say about it.Needless to say, highly recommended. I can't say for sure that those who don't normally read popular science books will get into it, but I would urge them to give it a try anyway, since this subject matter and what all of us think about it is directly applicable to real world decision making."
33,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"At first, when I was reading this book I felt that I was treading on well-ploughed ground. How many times can I read about the tragedy of the commons or the trolley dilemma? (Apparently at least one more, although I can't say I'm confident that it won't come up again.)Greene does try to freshen things up a bit with a new tragedy of the commons -- a tragedy of common sense morality. His analogy and metaphor were strained at best, but the idea is one we are dealing with in our current political environment. Individual groups/tribes have their own individual morality that is in conflict with other groups or tribes. Red or Blue anyone? Atheist or Believer? You get the idea. Greene's solution is a meta-morality that can bring the tribes together. Rather than John Rawls' social justice, he opts for utilitarianism. Much of the book is a defense of utilitarianism that could be summarized as true utilitarians wouldn't get the results utilitarian critics say they do. I feel Greene's pain in trying to articulate his philosophy -- in part because I tend to agree with him. He has a beef with Jonathan Haidt saying that Haidt claims that liberals have deficient moral taste buds. I've read Haidt and didn't get the impression. Interestingly I think that Haidt's research is very illuminating and actually shows the vulnerable parts of ""righteous"" thinking in the United States political system. If your morality is based on authority, then when it comes to the authority you acquiesce to in politics it should be the constitution, not God. (Caesar gets what's Caesar's). This isn't to say there are some pretty dumb tribal arguments on what the Constitution means, but I'll argue the Constitution any day rather than argue about God's will. What Greene really seems to be seeking is a morality that is more empirical, based on evidence, although he only couches it in philosophical terms. Much of the book talks about our dual mental, neurological functioning subconscious and instinctive versus conscious and deliberative or Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. Greene's critique of Rawls seems a little misplaced because by Greene's definition of utilitarianism reaches the same result. Greene gets there by positing that our discussions on morality should be based on an empirical effort to add the greatest increase in happiness for the largest number of people. Rawls gets there by bringing it to an individual level, where you formulate your morality and laws based on using your deliberation and thinking of yourself as the person most negatively impacted by the proposed moral/legal premise. Properly applied, I think they both end up in the same place.As a legal practitioner in real life with real people and real problems, I have a very utilitarian type view on how laws/morality should play out. Laws that increase collective happiness and ameliorate suffering are necessary. The meta-morality Greene seeks for inter-tribal conflict isn't as hard to grasp as he seems to make it. The hard part is getting insular moral tribes to listen."
34,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14526744-robert-miller,5,"The author embarks on the enormous task of defining morality and then arguing how it should apply to modern society. Starting with ""Tribe"" mentality, which encompasses the moral behaviors between individuals and the collective members of a tribe, he identifies the first hurdle of ""Me versus Us""- as issues pertaining to individual tribes; second, he examines the relationship between multiple tribes using a ""Its Us versus Them"" perspective. Recognizing the inherent problems between both entities, he endeavors to define a method through which differently situated individuals and groups can get along most effectively. To accomplish this task, Greene suggests that ""cooperation"" is central for all members of individual and collective tribes to overcome the ""conflicting moralities"" between members- he calls this system a ""metamorality"". He posits that this style of living would go the farthest to promote prosperity for all.Greene compares our intellectual and brain capacity to that of a camera with automatic and manual settings- the former designed for instant perception fraught with learned biases and prejudices- the latter with mental reasoning power, which according to the theory, can and should be used to eliminate the negative baggage brought on by cultural and group preconceived beliefs pertaining to such matters as race, gender, religion, same sex matters and other hot issues. His prescription for obtaining healthier cultures, where people can ""live together despite [their] different values, beliefs, and interests"", is through ideals of utilitarianism- an admitted liberal belief system which purportedly will afford society the best opportunity to provide society with ""the best overall consequences"". Greene recognizes the vast differences between group beliefs (conservative versus liberal, etc.), but insists that the ""dual process brain"" will provide the kind of efficiency and flexibility needed to reach a ""deep and pragmatic"" philosophy of living which in turn will guide ""tribe"" members towards empathy and tolerance which will lead to better pleasures and happiness (albeit it, at different levels and types) for all. To accomplish all of this, Greene argues that some individuals may need to look beyond their specific moral beliefs and learn to communicate through avenues of ""common currency""- a process of ""universal values"". Of the three models of ""moral truth"", religious, mathematical and scientific, Greene prefers science combined with the experience of our elders. While recognizing the imperfection of his theories, he believes he has pointed us towards a great starting point towards achieving the universal goal of looking out for all members of society- I agree- Excellent book."
35,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6614224-sara-van-dyck,5,"Greene, Joshua. Moral Tribes. Brilliant, fascinating. What follows is my common-sense, less-informed thinking on his propositions.I have a question about Greene’s ”Rules” of morality. In principle I guess they are great , certainly well-researched, carefully reasoned. But who are they for and how will they help? They could be used by other academics, other liberals, other thoughtful, conscientious people such as you and me – at least when we can get out of automatic mode. But looking at people’s behaviors, I think that Haidt (at least as Greene explains his view) is correct in saying that “moral reasoning plays a minor role in moral life.” Greene says that Haidt’s view doesn’t help answer what we should do. But consider Rule # 4: “ Beware of biased fairness.” It is so difficult to put aside out own biases, as the research of Greene and others demonstrates, that to me Green’s solutions are idealistic but not very realistic. Although Haidt may not have as complete a suggestion, I think the way he acknowledges that others have different value systems, different moral sensibilities, and that these are critical to them, points the way to understanding them. And there’s no way to persuade or even budge someone else unless we can see their point of view. It may not fit Greene’s logical system – but it’s still theirs.Also,look at rule #3: “Focus on the facts, and make others do the same.” In the world of moral, political, economic, religious decisions, the facts aren’t clear and the interpretation of those facts is even fuzzier. Want to prove a society functions better with universal health care? Make Denmark your example. But the demographics there are quite different from those of the U.S. Facts work under the condition of ""all else being equal,"" which it never is. Another example: In the WSJ of May 15, 2014, A 15, economist Martin Feldstein disputes Thomas Picketty’s analysis of economic inequality. The men aren’t disagreeing on the facts – they are disagreeing on which facts are relevant and how they should be interpreted. "
36,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12197491-bill,4,"This is a very readable overview of the relationship between morality and broadly-defined tribalism. Greene's message is that moral values are above all ""social glue"" (my term, not his) - they serve to bind us together into communities of trust; they are an essential element of in-group cohesiveness. Viewed in that light, the moral values of individuals and tribes are even less open to rational discussion than we otherwise might have thought. Compromise on matters of morality is very difficult, since it amounts to disloyalty to your tribe. Greene makes the case that Utilitarian morality - the greatest happiness for the greatest number - can function as a ""meta-morality"" for resolving conflicts between incompatible moral systems. He fails to convince, though, since he never explains why yielding to Utilitarian morality is any easier than yielding to some other tribe's moral values. Indeed, you're left with the impression that what he really means is that *his* tribe's moral foundation (Utilitarianism) is clearly superior and that if all these other tribes would just acknowledge that we'd get along much better.Too bad. A workable meta-morality would be a great thing for Humanity. Nevertheless, this book does a wonderful job of framing the discussion about competing moral values."
37,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3010400-ameya-warde,5,"Greene takes a subject that less nerdy folks might find somewhat dry (moral philosophy and neuroscience!) and with a conversational and funny style, makes it eminently readable. Which is great because it allows me to recommend this book to EVERYONE, regardless of level of nerdiness (So long as its at least at the level of reading non-fiction). I got this book after the cluster**** of the 2016 election, looking for ways to understand and communicate with, the other side. This absolutely helped me understand the differences in the way I think and other significant chunks of my country, and, while it doesn't directly address how to communicate across the aisle like another book I'm currently reading does, it also adds important depth of understanding to my reading of the communication-based book. Especially for my friends involved in politics &/or activism, I highly recommend checking this out. And, if you're into audio books, the narration on this is EXCELLENT and makes for quite enjoyable listening, actually. Someone who doesn't listen to audiobooks drove somewhere with my recently, and this was my commute listening, and they were confused as to why it sounded like someone super intelligent was just conversationally chatting with us, instead of, i guess, dry boring book-reading. To me that's a good recommendation for the audiobook!"
38,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8351117-justin-powell,5,"Essential reading for those interested in morality and specifically utilitarianism, or as he calls it in this book, ""deep pragmatism"". One of the biggest problems with this book (a problem that isn't even the fault of the book or its author) is the fact that those who most need to read it, social conservatives, are also the most likely NOT to read it. They are the supposedly ""closed-off"" to new experience as Jonathan Haidt would say. Of course everyone should read this, but the ones who most likely need to the most, the ones he also disagrees with, will not read it. I actually recommend reading this book either with, or after reading The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt. Why? Because I think he also presents one of the most enlightening cases of understanding morality, but also because Joshua Greene focuses on his theory in the latter portion of the book. It helps to be familiar. Coincidentally he doesn't write on how to address the actual problem this book will have. That being how do we make those most doxastically closed feel it's a good thing to expand their moral understandings. Conclusion - read this book!"

The second half is a long plea by the author for the reader to accept his philosophy. Even the author seems to not really support it, he constantly is saying things along the lines of ""well even though this seems awful and unworkable, just over look that & agree with my philosophy"". The second half of the book is just terribly, terribly written. I finished it because of my own masochistic tendencies, but I would recommend you don't even start this dull, rambling book. Also, the author regularly tells us about how amazing and smart he is. Basically, he went to Ivy league schools for undergrad and grad school; aren't you amazed?! He sure thinks he's the smartest person out there! To me these incessant reminders of how ""smart"" the author thinks he is just made him come off like an idiotic prick, completely unaware of how out of touch he is. "

I waffled between 4 and 5, because I think the ideas discussed and the questions they pose merit 5. My biggest issue would be the accessibility of the book. It's not difficult to read, but I think a trimmed down, more clearcut version would go much farther toward achieving the author's aims just in terms of reaching a wider audience. Too many people who would otherwise be interested will not want to read something along the lines of moral philosophy at this length, and even many who start it will likely not persevere ... though if you're hedging, I would advise you to try. Keep reading. "

However, it soon becomes too preachy for its own good, and the author's preference of utilitarianism as a form of meta-morality comes across as a source of bias rather than the product of careful analysis.Although the first half was somewhat interesting, I couldn't make it to the end and eventually ditched it in the penultimate chapter for the reasons mentioned above. If anything, the book made me more suspicious of utilitarian claims, and I'm sure that wasn't what the author had in mind when he wrote it."

50,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,3,"The author, a professor of psychology, discusses the ways in which disparate groups in our society fail to come to a civil consensus, and how emotion often overrides their reason, and then offers a solution: the political theory of utilitarianism (which I studied and wrote a thesis on in college). Greene writes how as a young debate student he became confused as to how he could argue for one position and then another depending on the issue at hand. It was then that he discovered the theory of utilitarianism, which briefly asks us, when considering any issue, to try to determine which action or policy is best for the greatest number. The kind of utilitarianism Greene advocates for is not the bloodless ""act"" type that would allow 4 executions to save 6 people, but a ""rule"" type that takes the long view and determines that any number of executions would not be good for society as whole and takes the consequences of such an act, not just the doing of it, into consideration. Greene insists that this ""practical philosophy can help us solve our biggest problems"" when used as a ""meta-morality"" — that is, the moral calculus used to determine what is moral.The reason I would give this three stars rather than four is that on the whole I think it fails in its main purpose. While it is a readable and even entertaining exegesis on utilitarianism, especially in its detailing the various aspects of the famous Trolley problem, it really isn't useful at all in ""solving our biggest problems."" First off, love and morality aren't ""biological devices,"" as Green terms them — and even if they are, that isn't how we understand them, so it's nearly impossible to insert them into any kind of moral calculus, no matter how refined. In this technological age when a fairly near future is possible that could see the human race groomed a stratified society of satisfied fools, à la Brave New World, this is dangerous thinking. Second, while it's optimistic and well-intentioned to think that people would embrace this political theory and thus renounce all other tries to their ""tribal morality,"" culture, history, and clan, it's far from likely."
51,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Moral Tribes covers a lot of ground, ranging from tribalism to trolleyology. I think that it does a fairly good job on the whole by addressing the Tragedy of Common Sense Morality, which explains quite well why we don't seem to get along despite being moral creatures. The Dual Process Theory and the implications that it poses on our sense of morality is well explained too. I enjoyed reading about the chapters that described our tendencies to rationalise our views despite them making little sense, a concept that has slowly become ubiquitous. A section of the book is written as a defence and later as a rebranding of utilitarianism, which seems to be out of place because reader is conscious that the author is actively pushing for it. He envisions a world of deep pragmatism using metamortality and a common currency, with sounds rather intriguing, but needs much more concrete definitions to apply it in practice. I've read the Righteous Mind by Haidt previously and did think that the Moral Foundations Theory made sense, and Greene hasn't done much to dissuade me from it. Nevertheless, I found the book quite illuminating as my interest in moral psychology grows and the six rules in the end are quite practical to have in mind. "
52,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24675457-lisa,4,"This is an incredibly important book and we need more of us to read it to have any chance of moving us forward as a healthy, diverse, global society.

What I really loved about the authors writing style is it made the experience of reading this book feel like one long and very interesting conversation, interspersed with some 'presentations' about interesting social experiments.I did however find some parts of the book a bit overly repetitive and with a bit too much summarising and re summarising, but I can see how he was using this to build the ideas."
53,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10984519-maria,4,"Joshua Greene combines psychology, neuroscience, and moral philosophy to expand on Daniel Kahneman’s findings about the way our brains work, fast (emotionally) and slow (manually). Greene traces how, over thousands of years, our brains developed instant, emotional responses to promote co-operation and ensure our tribal survival. This automatic setting effectively solves the tragedy of the commons by making us peaceable tribal members who get ahead by working together, putting the collective ""us"" above the selfish ""me, me, me."" Greene goes on to argue that this same automatic setting now gets us into trouble in the modern world, because that same “us vs. them"" thinking isn't as helpful as it was in ancient times. Today, we live in large, intertribal communities and suffer from the problem of the ""commonsense morality"" - that our culture's/religion's/tribe’s common sense solutions to its internal moral problems, can and should be used to solve the problems of the world-at-large. We must abandon this thinking, and switch into manual mode when tackling the controversies of the modern experience.Greene and other scholars have proven through careful experimentation (see, e.g., the always great ""hot researcher on a bridge"" test) that our automatic settings are easily fooled and that we are highly susceptible to the rationalization of our emotional responses. And we use these automatic, emotional moralities - developed through thousands of years of evolution, and just decades of tribal experience in whatever small communities we grew up - to make public policy and political decisions, a revelation that is is frankly appalling. We should not be making decisions about healthcare, the economy, human rights, or any other issue at the macro level in this trigger-happy, emotional, fast-action way. As Greene aptly notes, this thinking is what led us to hundreds of years of African enslavement, for the simple reason that one 'tribe' just felt it was right that they were better than another. There are common, pan-tribal (or post-tribal, even!) currencies that can be found to change the way we form our decision making -- science, to me, seems like an obvious forerunner for the issues to which there are factual resolutions. It's so surprising that we don’t rely on it more, and that there is still so much political upheaval around things that have been long-settled in the scientific community (looking at you, climate change). Here, Greene proposes using utilitarianism as a metamorality, a common currency, by doing what is best for the greatest amount of people: more concretely, by treating happiness as the most important thing, and by valuing everyone’s happiness the same. The human happiness index would be an interesting new standard for how we measure the success of our societies, no doubt. However, the 200-some pages Greene spends on convincing me of utilitarianism largely fall flat, as he redefines it away from its known philosophical meaning into something I’m not sure I understand enough to regurgitate here. Something like… “if it sounds horrible and doesn’t make common sense, then that’s not utilitarianism.” But what is common sense, Greene? Have you not just said that part of the problem in our modern world is the lack of a common ground on which we can stand, a lack of common sense? The trolley argument Greene spends so much time on, though interesting as far as it showcases the moral deficiencies of our emotional processing, felt largely unresolved by the end of the book. Would utilitarianism compel me to push a man (directly or indirectly) in order to save the lives of five? Do I really want to go through life knowing that if I’m standing quietly, nicely, law-abidingly on a subway track and some idiot family decided to camp out on the rails I could be pushed off by some “do-gooder” in order to save the five? I don’t know, I’m just not convinced, and in the end I’m left with a bad taste in my mouth in regards to utilitarianism; I’m reminded only of the short story by Ursula K. Le Guin, “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.” In it, she describes a failed utopia in which all of Omelas’ citizens are happy, healthy, and prosperous at the cost of the suffering and misery of a single child. Speaking from a utilitarian perspective, the net happiness gain is high (a no-brainer even). But is that the kind of place we should aspire toward?Ultimately, no matter how often Greene repeated that utilitarianism would never result in this Omelas-like future as long as we use our ""common sense” (again, Greene, what are you thinking, using the concept you dismantled to argue for your moral currency), I wasn't convinced. But don’t get me wrong. While I don’t always agree with his solutions, Greene is obviously brilliant, and my favorite thing about his writing is its incredible ability to deliver difficult concepts to a mainstream audience - to make (social/neuro) science fun, Neil deGrasse Tyson style. I would recommend this to anyone as a primer on cognitive behavior and an introduction to the very real problem of finding a shared morality in our day and age. With advances in science bringing us closer and closer to the day we might make contact with a species far different than our own, it is more imperative than ever that we find a common human currency under which we can voice our disagreements, make more sensical compromises, and ultimately end up with better moral decision making. While this might not be the book that houses the all philosophical answers, it’s an amazing introduction to moral cognition and one of those reads that just gets you thinking for days."
54,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63297537-spencer-fancutt,4,"A sincere and robust attempt to use a new utilitarianism, a 'deep pragmatism' to 'transcend' the differing 'local' or 'tribal' moralities we possess and find a 'common currency' 'meta-morality' for the sake of peace and the greater good. The early chapters describing the sources of our current moralities are insightful and simply explained. It is probably to these that I would return for future reference, but the main thesis of the book holds its own attractions, albeit at a higher cost on attention and concentration. It is a compelling thesis that states that we can really only resort to a kind of utilitarianism to decide how to resolve difficulties between competing moralities. That is, if we are willing to consider that our own moralities which we hold dear are not universal and closed to discussion."

59,1594202605,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887419-brendan-shea,4,"In the book, Greene synethisizes his own research (mostly on the neural bases of moral decision-making) with arguments inspired by Kanheman, Haidt, Singer, and others to produce a pretty decent defense of utilitarianism. For the lay reader, I bet most of the material will be new, but my guess is that professional philosophers will probably be familiar with at least 50% of it. Still, there is plenty of interesting stuff in here that should be interesting, even to those with some background in the academic debates. I'm pretty close to Greene's ideal audience (I'm a left-liberal naturalist with strongly utilitarian tendencies), and I don't have many substantive disagreements with his conclusions. That being said, I don't think the book is perfect, and I worry that some of its shortcomings will lessen the impact on anyone who might be inclined to disagree with him (moral realists, deontologists, virtue ethicists, social conservatives, libertarians, etc.):1. I think Greene's use of the ""two systems"" reseach to debunk anti-utilitarian intuitions appealed to by thinkers like Kant, Rawls, Thomson, and Nozick are pretty convincing, even if not perfect. (This takes up the first 2/3 of the book or so). His detailed answer to Rawl's ""slavery"" objection to utilitarianism is great, as is his more general argument that deontological/rights/contractarian/virtue-ethics intutions are basically ad hoc rationalizations for ""automatic mode"" thinking. IMO, this argument is only strengthened by recent research (e.g., showing that anti-utilitarian intuitions on trolley cases are closely tied to the race, gender, and class of the victim), and by what we know of specific policy prefences favored by deontological vs. utilitarian thinkers (Kant was wrong about a whole lot more substantive moral judgments than Bentham or Mill were, and Mill's denial of natural propety rights is much more consonant with contemporary left-liberalism than is Rawls privileging of property rights in ATOJ.)2. Greene is less convicing in his response to the ""demanding-ness"" objection to utilitarianism. His basic idea is that any consequence of utilitarianism that seems ""too demanding"" cannot ""really"" be a consequence utilitarianism, since the ideal form of utilitarianism will (obviously) entail just those consequences that have the greated expected utility (so, we need to consider how many people will *actually adopt* the policies, as well as the *effects* of their adoption). This is a classic act-utilitarian strategy, and I'm (generally) in favor it. However, Greene basically uses this to dismiss *any* aspect of utilitarianism he doesn't like (veganism is morally optional! buying $800 suits is OK! promoting the happiness of not-yet-existing people is basically whatever!). He seems to be aware that Singer (his sometimes co-author) would probably disagree with some of these judgments, but he doesn't really *argue* that Singer is wrong--he simply jumps from ""this seems really demanding to me"" to ""Utilitarianism doesn't really say that I have to do this."" Worringly, I think Greene's failure to deal with this objection convicingly undercuts his treatment of the abortion debate, since his answer to the (hypothetical) pro-life consequentialist hinges crucially on this conception of what counts as ""too demanding."" I think Greene would have been better off following Singer all the way down the rabbit hole on this one, and recognzing that a truly utilitarian position on abortion is probably going to have highly counterintuitive consequences (and will not simply justify a mainstream prochoice position, as Greene seems to think).3. While I don't think this book is *really* going to talk anyone out of their heartfelt commitments to deontology, virtue ethics, or deontology, I do think these thinkers ought to take seriously Greene's argument that utilitarianism is uniquely positioned to serve as a sort of ""metamorality,"" and that it is the theory we ought to be appealing to in cases of moral conflict. In many cases, I don't think this is all that unnatural--people can (and do) transition from saying that ""Action A is wrong because of Rule R"" (in ordinary moral discourse) to ""General adherence to Rule R is justified on the basis of consequences C"" (when trying to justify this rule). In any case, I fully agree with Greene that appeals to things such as ""rights"" or ""duties"" are essentially useless when we are attempting to *justify*, *explain*, or *persuade*, even though they may be helpful in other contexts (in expressing our determination to do something, or our unwillingness to debate some issue). In this sense, they seem no better (and no worse) than appeals to things such as religious belief."
