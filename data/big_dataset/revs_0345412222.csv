Sagan and Druyan do a wonderful job telling the story of comets without having the reader feel as if they are sitting in a classroom....half bored. Yet, the reader is being told the story of these great traveling beauties that bring life and destruction through out the galaxy,We're introduced to Edmond Halley, the man that discovered Halley's Comet. Halley was an English astronomer, geophysicist, mathematician, meteorologist, and physicist. He spent a great deal of his studies on the world of comets. Even with all of Halley's studies, he only began to scratch the surface of what makes up a coment."

This is an excellent survey of our understanding of comets for the non-specialist. It opens with a long historiography of the ancient, medieval and early modern world’s view of comets as harbingers of disaster. Then moves into the scientists who evolved our current understanding of these fascinating celestial bodies. Halley and Newton stood out most strongly to me, but they were by no means the only ones. The book winds up with explorations of the probable impact (pun intended) of comets on the development of our planet and the life upon it. If you’ve any curiosity about any of these issues, you’re likely to greatly enjoy Comet. If you liked this review, you can find more at www.gilbertstack.com/reviews."
2,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80831211-patrick-kelly,4,"Comets By Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan - [ ] First Sagan book of the year. I am excited!- [ ] Opens with taking a journey on a lonely comet traveling a million year’s from the distant Oort Cloud through the solar system around the sun and eventually colliding with Earth.- [ ] A comet is a cold lonely thing. Flying through cold dark space. Mainly made of ice and possessing little gravity. It has no atmosphere and is a hunk of ice. They range in size but this was the size of a city if you include the tail. - [ ] It moves based on the pull of gravity fields, as all objects on the universe do. - [ ] The second chapter describes human’s relationship with comets through out history. Humans have been recording and observing comets for thousands of years. Since 3,000 BCE.- [ ] In almost all cultures they have signs of death, destruction, catastrophe, and omens. - [ ] The Chinese, Greeks, and Romans wrote about them.- [ ] There is a notable comet in the sky roughly once every 10 years - [ ] Edward Halley (1656 -1741): English scientist, Halley’s comet - [ ] Comets move in elliptical orbits - [ ] Was a contemporary and friend of Issac Newton- [ ] Brilliant scientist that contributed to the study of many fields, astronomy in particular. He was the one that began to make predictions on the return of certain comets. He correctly predicted the return of comets that would come after his death. - [ ] In a previous Sagan book he has a line about religion can not make accurate predictions but science can make accurate enough predictions about when certain planets will be in a certain place that they have been able to land rovers on those planets and have the Voyager Probes fly past multiple planets- [ ] Jupiter and it’s gravity sweep up most large comets - [ ] Halley did not discover Halley’s comet but it was named after him - [ ] Comets have strange orbits that I want to look up - [ ] There seems to be a section in every Sagan book that does not capture me/I tune out. The Halley section was it for this book - [ ] Kant was mentioned - [ ] The 1760’s was a big decade - [ ] Long period comets: out to the Oort Cloud and with orbits greater than 200 years, they have orbits of thousands of years. Hale-Bopp is 2500 years- [ ] Short period comets: Kuiper belt and less than 200 year orbit. Halley’s comet is 76 years - [ ] The sun, planets, and other gravities have an effect on the orbit of comets and change their orbit - [ ] Comets are made from the remnants of planets and the beginning of our solar system - [ ] Comets and ice- [ ] The chemical make up of comets - [ ] Chemistry - [ ] Lots of technical stuff about comets; composition, tail, movement - [ ] A section about the history of the swastika and how it could actually be a comet - [ ] The Oort Cloud - [ ] Comet: primarily composed of ice and dust, contain long/short orbits, have a tail/nucleolus, larger than a meteor, often many kilometers in size- [ ] Asteroid: the remnants of planets, composed of mineral and rock, typically live in the astroid belt, are not seen by the naked eye, don’t have a tail/nucleolus - [ ] Meteor: a small piece of a comet or asteroid that breaks off and burns up in the atmosphere - [ ] The origins of our solar system - [ ] Cataclysms, extinctions, comets - [ ] Again he mentions human’s negative impact on the planet and us being the cause of animal extinction. Also we are the ones that can stop it. - [ ] We intercepted and took photos of comets in his life time, he talks about it. In the past ten years we have landed on a comet, collected samples, and they are being returned to Earth. Science and math are amazing. - [ ] I always think of his line about theologians not being able to predict god but scientists can predict the timing and place of comets and planets to such a precise point that we can land rovers on them. - [ ] Even when I am zoned out during this book I have an image of a comet hurtling through the lonely darkness of space. Although the solar system does not seem as lonely. Sagan has made me feel like it is smaller and a family. The opening chapters of placing me on a comet for millions of years, that image and feeling has stayed with me throughout the book. - [ ] He talks about mining comets, living on comets, and traveling on comets - [ ] Halley’s comet has been noted by civilizations across the planet since at least 200 BCE. It is a time capsule of our world. It has been recorded on animals skins and in clay tablets. It visits us once a life time. It is poetic.- [ ] Sagan ends in a typical Sagan way. Reminding us of the importance of our planet, the fragility of our existence, the importance and absolute insignificance of our life on this tiny rock. We are floating in a infinite ocean of the cosmos. Sagan always hits with magic, wonder, and aww. - [ ] Comets are really the only travelers of the cosmic ocean.- [ ] Not the most engaging of his books but beautiful and timeless "

Writing in his 1985 book, Comet, author Carl Sagan takes the reader on another imaginary journey. This time the observer is riding aboard a wayward comet traveling from the Solar System's outer fringe, around the sun and back into deep space again, giving the reader a birds eye view of what you would see on such a trip. Who knows where such ""flights of fancy"" can lead? The former; to a paradigm changing theory. And the latter; to an in depth look at a strange visitor from the depths of space. Part science, part history and, in the original hard-bound edition, a generous helping of classical and new art work. While the Kindle edition has the charts, graphs and many black & white illustrations the beautiful color paintings are either missing or rendered in B&W. While this does not diminish Sagan's text in any way, it would have been a nice addition to the overall reading experience. You have to wonder what the publishers were thinking when they OK'd this treatment of both Cosmos and Comet for e-reader release. The text itself is stunning, Sagan's knowledge seems unlimited and his writing skills were never better. This edition is the 1997 update by co-author Ann Druyan to include any new findings (to that point) and theories on comets and astronomy but you may want to use this book as a jumping off point to more recent writings. The history of comets and how they interacted with human society is fascinating and Sagan takes you back to the beginning, to our earliest records of comet sightings. What are comets made of? How are they formed? Follow the birth and life of our Mysterious Traveler on it's journey through the Solar System. The author covers the mechanics of how their orbits are created and the risk that comets may pose to our planet. If a large object, comet or meteor, ever struck the Earth it could have a devastating effect on our environment and all life, including humans. Has this ever happened? What is the connection between comets and meteorites? Sagan covers all this and more in this classic science book. The book closes with a section of extreme speculation and philosophy that the author offers up for your consideration, take it for what you will, just keep an open mind. From Sagan's point of view the future has boundless possibilities. Comets may be an unlimited resource of water, minerals and energy that we can mine for use in space-construction or colonization of other planets. All it needs is the courage to take a course of action that will benefit us in the short run and future generations in the long run as well. Whether you're reading Comet for the science, history, or just for nostalgic reasons it's a worthwhile read. So buy your ticket and hop aboard the Comet express. There's always room for another observer. I had no technical or formatting problems with this Kindle edition.Last Ranger"
4,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"Being the seventh Carl Sagan's book I've read,""Comet"" was a book co-written by, of course, the late Great Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan in 1985 before the return of the historical comet Halley. The book offers us a spectacular ride on the comet from its origins to the point when it gets close to the Sun and heads back to where it comes from. After that, nearly everything you might be curious or might not even imagine to ask about comets will lie on the pages; the histories, myths, the physical appearances, the compositions, impacts, and future influences of these wonderful visitors from the frozen interstellar darkness. The authors' visions for the future advantages of comets and asteroids for our space exploration raise many intriguing questions to the readers and make them wish that governments would unite for the sake of science, knowledge and the survival of human civilization. Opportunity, money and technology to reach that goal are already within our grasp, but everything else is up to us to decide whether we would waste the money on war or invest them in exploration for our long term benefits. ""Comets may act as the creators, the preservers, and the destroyers of life on Earth,"" the authors argue, ""A surviving dinosaur might have reason to mistrust them, but humans might more appropriately consider the comets in a favorable light—as bringers of the stuff of life to Earth, as ocean-builders, as the agency that removed the competition and made possible the success of our mammalian ancestors, as possible future outposts of our species, and as providers of a timely reminder about large explosions and the climate of the Earth."" Comets and asteroids could be extract as raw materials so that we wouldn't need to send them from earth, which would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, they could provide fuels, water and many other organic materials, making the exploration more bearable and reachable.Yes, the book was written 26 years ago. Despite being revised in 1997, many discoveries related to comets have been discovered and understood since then. Yet, the book cannot be devalued; it can be an informative companion to the study of comet in our modern day."
5,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869217-glyn-longden,3,"Rating: 6.5/10. The volume I read was not the revised version but the original which was released in 1985 just BEFORE Halley's Comet. Sagan obviously was trying to cash in on the interest in the comet. The problem with reading science books which are more than 20 years old is that much of the material is dated, incorrect, speculation, or irrelevant. So while Sagan offers much which is interesting there is none of the later research such as the 'Giotto' mission or the comet Shumaker-Levy which crashed into Jupiter. I'm not sure whether some of his theories were either proved or not proved....for example, the notion that extinctions occur on Earth roughly every 30 million years is caused by the 'bobbing' of the sun through the plane of the galaxy as it revolves around its centre. I did enjoy the book, and, yes, it does have lots of pictures and photos. However, as always happens when I read books like this I realize it is time to find a modern, up-to-date, latest theories text."
6,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Comet is a masterpiece of scientific writing. Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan wrote this book for the return of Halley's Comet in 1985. It goes over the history and cultural implications of comets in our society.Sagan opens the book with a thought experiment. Imagine that you are flying through space astride a comet. You start at the Oort Cloud. A force tugs at the comet, spoiling the delicate balance of forces suspending it in that location. A comet is a small, icy body that travels through the solar system. As the comet approaches the sun, it grows a tail due to the solar radiation that batters it.Sagan takes several chapters to explain what comets mean to different civilizations. Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, Tycho Brahe, and Edmund Halley all participated in modernizing astronomy. Aristotle was taken seriously for centuries. Eventually, it became too much to maintain. With the advent of the telescope, human beings could finally see beyond the reach of the naked eye.Sagan explores the Alvarez Hypothesis. At the time, it was a new idea.Comet is a beautifully illustrated book. Sagan writes clearly. In short, I have no complaints. The only issue I can think of is that the book was written in 1985 and is dated. This is hardly Sagan's fault, though. He did an excellent job considering the technology of the time."
7,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109063053-bryan-whitehead,4,"Following on the heels of Carl Sagan’s success with Cosmos (which this book strongly resembles, at least visually), he teams up with Ann Druyan to focus more narrowly on a topic that was hot when this book came out in 1985 (thanks to the perihelion passage of Halley’s Comet). Though not really on par with Sagan’s more famous work, this nonetheless makes for an interesting read. I didn’t know much about comets prior to picking this up, and now I’d like to learn more about what we’ve learned about them in the two decades since this book came out. In spots the text drifts off into wild speculation, an unwelcome element that’s joined at the end by a loss of organization and the usual indulgence of Sagan’s now-quaint obsession with nuclear war. Overall, however, this is a worthwhile read for anyone in my shoes: possessed of an interest in the subject but not much knowledge about it."
8,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7307086-joan,5,"Journey through space with a comet, then explore the myths that arose around these celestial travelers. In this informative book, readers can investigate the scientific findings surrounding comets while learning how they spurred some great scientific discoveries. Filled with amazing photographs, sketches, and diagrams, this is a definitive scientific work on comets. Readers with an interest in space science and the universe will find much to appreciate here.Highly recommended."
9,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72246204-john,5,What's it like to ride around the sun on a comet? In this book Carl Sagan perfectly describes the journey along with a history of comets and how different cultures have viewed them. You will learn what comets are made of and how they travel through the solar system. Whenever I read a book like this it amazes how much humans have discovered about the universe... and how much there is still to discover.
10,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43973467-ian-wilson,4,"Love this book - now need to read more on Edmond Halley.Love the way that Sagan's books empbody the joy of space, Astronomy and science and instils within it a love of history of science and awe at the geniuses of earlier times fundemental in building our modern view of science and the universe. The science is written in a way to impart concepts without overwhelming mathematic proofs."
11,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3133678-fate-s-lady,3,"This was interesting but not the most engrossing book I've ever read. I still enjoyed learning about the origin and composition of comets and their role in the solar system, but I felt like a lot of information was a little bit redundant and at times I definitely felt my attention begin to wander. "
12,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897859-bryan-jaketic,3,"Carl Sagan's writing is always enjoyable, but this book focused on a narrower topic than his others have and it gets a bit bogged down in details. As a result, it lacks the larger sense of wonder that his other books convey."
13,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17794151-angus-stirling,2,"It feels like a publisher threw cash at Carl to quickly throw a book on comets together ahead of Halley's comet's arrival in '86, and then marketed it as though it were is substance the successor to the revered Cosmos."
14,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4819662-tom-menke,5,everything saga wrote was worth reading
15,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3434007-brandon,5,An excellent book about comets that is a little dated since it was written over 30 years ago.
16,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28643351-tom-cross,4,"This is really a text book on comets, very detailed and rich in detail. It’s definitely not light reading."
17,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23245012-madyson-carter,4,"Carl Sagen's purpose in writing this book is to inform people about comets, the history of their observations, the people who made a huge impact on our understanding of comets, where they come from, what they're made of, etc. The theme of course is comets. The style of this book is an exposition because it is an explanation and analysis of comets to bring some clarity and understanding on comets. In my opinion it was very good. What I liked is that it didn't just spew scientific unorganized nonsense at you and that it explored the history and future of the comet and our observations of them. What I didn't like is that in some of the chapters it started to talk about how the universe was made and for that reason I completely skipped over some chapters because they went against my beliefs. If I could change anything I would take out the chapters that talked about how the universe was made. It is not like any book I've read. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars and I must warn you that since this book was published in 1985 some of the information is outdated. "
18,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22954475-gary-brooks,5,An excellent work by an excellent scientist. like a magical train ride through the entire solar system.
19,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"It's hard to imagine that discovery of the Kuiper Belt, the end of the Soviet Union, the identification of the Chicxulub Crater as that of the comet or asteroid that caused the K-T extinction, and the arrival of Comet Hale-Bopp, were all events unknown to the authors at the time of their writing.Had they known about these events it is certain they would have had a large impact (no pun) on how they constructed much of the book, at least the latter parts of it.Still, much of the book is well worthwhile even to today's reader since a large part of it deals with the history of comets and their discoverer's. And Carl Sagan's phraseology rings so true at times it's almost as if you could hear him narrating it out loud.The photos and diagrams are also well worth it."
20,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15367776-kate,5,"This could have been titled ""Comet Halley"" and I would have been perfectly fine with that. I want to live to see Comet Halley in 2061 since I had recently been born when it passed by in 1985-86. The amount of information pertaining to Edmond Halley and his infamous comet filled me with gratitude and now I know where the info for the most recent Cosmos television series came from. Near the end of the book, Sagan makes mention of future journeys into ""trans-Plutonian"" space and of flying a craft to a comet, both of which have recently occurred, about 30 years from the time of publication. I'm sure there is plenty of outdated information in this book but it's exciting to me to be able to live through it and learn where science has been, where it's going etc..."
21,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8194637-useresu,4,"I have to admit, if Cosmos was a mainstream and overall view of our universe and is as human species, each subsequent book I read from Sagan simply feels like an uncut version of one of the chapters of Cosmos. This one in particular is about Comets and you will learn everything- the history, the myth, the composition, the physics, the chemistry, the theory, the journeys now and and the future. It's a magnificent story written in typical Sagan and Druyan way. So if you're new to it - read Cosmos first. If you're not - why are you reading this review? Just get on with it!"
22,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,0,"Received as a gift many years ago. Disappeared during one move or another; no clue whose shelf it is on today. As I recall, a gorgeous book on par with 
Cosmos
 though certainly much more focused in its subject matter. As I recall, it has an illustration of the Halley's Comet orbital path in the upper right corner of the odd (even? whichever is the right-side) pages and when you flip through them, you can watch the comet orbit the sun. Brilliant."
23,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/466069-chris-k,3,"Some parts were amazing, others a little too raw and without knowing how much of the book was outdated by recent scientific study it was hard to remain focused on the more technical details. Regardless, ""Comet"" will make you think long and hard about the origins of our solar system and the future of humans in outer space. The best part of the book is about the historical perspective on comets and the eventual understanding of them by scientists. "
24,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,4,"Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan attempt to explain comets, their origins, their composition, and what they mean to Earth in a simple way that non-scientists can understand. (Even still, there were a few times where they get a little *too* sciencey or too mathy, even for me.)Lots of pictures, diagrams, collections of comet-related artwork, and beautiful paintings done for the book."
25,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660601-charlie-george,2,"This is my least favorite of 6 books I've read of the late Carl Sagan and I love his work. I learned very interesting things about comets, but it seemed like I could have learned them all in about one-fifth of this book. He was capable of much more concise writing, and this book suffers from being obsolete as we continue to learn more about the celestial bodies with ongoing robotic probes."
26,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2827746-ian,4,"The book about comets that I've been searching for. Ya gotta love that Sagan voice. Still woefully out-of-date, though. Seems like it was revised for reprint during the same 1996 ""books about comets"" boom, but that just means it's 20 years behind instead of 30.Delightful."
27,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84831-josh,5,"Great book. Reads like a reference book at times, but still very interesting stuff. Realized while reading this book, that there's still a lot we don't know about comets."
28,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1081965-jay,5,"The history here is fantastic. It's interesting to compare how medeival China recorded comets, with how Europe did (or didn't) at the same time. "
29,0345412222,http://goodreads.com/user/show/910909-j-d,4,I recommend this book for its entertaining and detailed history and information on the subject. Written in the sweeping style associated with the autjor(s).
