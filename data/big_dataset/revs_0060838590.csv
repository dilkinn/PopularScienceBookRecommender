On-line, of course, we are all much likelier to then wander off on yet more linked tangents, but thankfully, in his actual, paper and ink book, Winchester keeps bringing us back to the main page. And a large page it is.  Simon Winchester - image from his Twitter pageOne can expect certain things in Simon Winchester books, a wide array of information, from a look at relevant geology, where appropriate, to history, to some of the personalities relevant to his subject, to a look at how the object of his scrutiny changed the world, economically, politically, even artistically. Put away your checklist. It is all here. There is a very accessible discussion of plate tectonics, not just as the process relates to Krakatoa (in a very, very big way) but of the history of the theory, with some surprising links to well known scientists who, Moses-like, led the way without actually reaching the final conclusion. Winchester always satisfies by presenting a cornucopia of facts about the time and the subject. How loud was this very big bang? It was heard over three thousand miles away. In fact the Krakatoan blast was one of the five loudest events in human history.  Illustration was made before the big bang - image from BBCHe offers a considerable history of the global relations in that part of the world. The Netherlands was the significant imperial force in the area at that time, so much of what we know of the event was recorded by Dutch observers. Winchester describes what happened to area settlements as a result of the eruption. It will come as no surprise that associated tsunamis were the major cause of death.Ash that was shot out of the earth by Krakatoa circled the globe, affecting not only the visual beauty of sunsets (enough to influence many painters) but the climate as well, causing a shortened summer, and thus a poor crop. What happens after the volcano has exhausted its explosive urges? Or, where did that island go? Winchester looks at what came after, both the re-emergence of geological elements of Krakatoa, and the population of that land by life. Readers of Simon Winchester know what he offers. A rich, educational and entertaining experience. If you love to learn new things, particularly about historical people and events, and like to take on that info in a most pleasant way, Winchester is one of the best guides in the world, a terrific writer, who leads you on an unexpected journey with treasures of knowledge to be found.

1,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,2,"Wow. This has got to be the most out of topic (OOT) book I’ve ever read. It saddens me to only award it two stars. I usually have a soft spot for nonfictions *sigh*Why on earth did I do that? Some of my friends rated it five stars, after all… Here’s a glimpse of my train of thoughts while reading this book. You’ll see why.Beginning:“Yay, finally I get to read this book. A nonfiction about (something major happened in) Indonesia, oh the excitement!...*reading the first pages* Hmm ok, spice trade….pepper….Dutch early occupation…I already know most of the things here…but obviously the author never intended this book only for Indonesians so okay lah…But…but now he’s talking about map making…what the…I have a baaaad feeling about this book…oh crap now he’s blabbering about J.P. Coen (first VOC governor general)…hmm ok some of the factoids are insightful but if he’s keeping this OOT streak….hmm now stories about living in (the old) Batavia…I knew that….and that…and that…*skipping*…where’s the frickin Krakatau story?...OMG tell me he did not just drone on the Wallace line (and his life story) and continental drift theories for 60 pages? Seriously? 60 pages? Couldn’t he shorten it to 5 pages max?” Seven hells!""*closing the book* *pissed*Almost in the middle:“Now page 115 and I haven’t read anything exciting about the eruption….ok now about living in (the new Batavia)…Daendels….Rafles….Bogor….dance parties….*skip skip*….Ahhh now he’s finally talking about the earlier (suspected) eruptions of the volcano…interesting speculations…hmmm yeah this book is growing on me now….wait wait, why he’s giving me a history lesson about Lloyd’s insurance? And the submarine telegraph cables? I know they’re relevant to the story but the sudden “expositions” in the middle of the main story is upsetting me…. Oh wonderful…truly marvelous Mr. Winchester, now you’re yapping about the history of news agencies/Reuters….throw me some bones here…*closing the book* *pissed*Halfway:“Yikes it took halfway to the book to get to the real story! Hmm ok….now I know the difference between volcanic and earthquake vibrations…early warning system turned out to be quite ok…reports from various sources including ships….LOL the Dutch was offering disaster tourism (unique factoid) with daredevils going to the islands, walking in calf-deep ash to check out the craters (while the volcanos were still preparing for the big bang and spewing smokes here and there)…..er…what was with the elephant chapter? So, apparently there was a circus troupe in Batavia a night before the kaboom and an elephant went panic. The author for unknown reasons (maybe he felt the need to give attractive title to his chapters) made a chapter titled The Curious Case of the Terrified Elephant, 11 pages, but the elephant itself was only mentioned in the last 2 pages. Kind of reflecting the content of the book itself, huh?” *closing the book* *slightly pissed – getting used to it by then*The crack of doom:“Finally *flexing my muscles” (now I’m on page 209) The book has at least 384 pages…..Whoa, great writing. Great facts. Quite gripping. *concentrating* *frowned at some facts* *nodding in satisfaction* *feeling good for the first time when reading the book*Near the end:“Er….why Indonesian rebellion is discussed here? Now, now Mr. Winchester, you’re giving the eruption too much credit. *skip skip* Oh wow, a chapter about the Krakatau Jr. This is a must read. Uhuh. Yessir. This volcano is alive and kicking and close to me. I hope I’ll be long gone before it erupts again….{well, seven years after I wrote this review, deadly eruption has occurred.}Hmm wait..wait *flipping back a few pages* the book is over? But but…I only read something useful for about 150 pages…does this copy has missing pages? Am I dreaming?” *scratching my head in utter confusion* *closing the book after realizing it wasn’t a dream and no missing pages*Final thoughts:Well, ok if the author could only write 150 pages why not make the book of only 150 pages of the REAL BLOODY DEAL? More than half of the book was about background stories, for Wallace’s sake! Why couldn’t he write like Dava Sobel in her enchanting (yet CONCISE) account about the invention of longitude (Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of his Time) which is a far less sexy topic compared with a super volcanic eruption, I daresay.Reading this book is like going to the movies, expecting to watch a drama-action movie, but interrupted with commercials and trailers on other movies even during some of the action scenes. Sorry, I am a very busy book-reader whose reading time is so valuable and hate to see it wasted. Thank goodness I only borrowed this book *putting it back on my boss’ shelf, kthxbye*Update 26/12/2018: Eruption event and underwater landslide at Anak Krakatau occurred on December 23, 2018, killing over than 400 people (and counting).

2,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,4,"Simon Winchester could turn your decrepit granny's boring old stories into lively, magical tales. He has a way of putting the reader into the past while making them feel as if the historical subjects he writes about are fresh and very much of the present. Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded is no exception. Though this raging volcano's past exploits in the form of catastrophic explosions can only be guessed at for lack of reliable eyewitnesses aside from its late 1800s eruption, Winchester still manages to crowd your senses with the sights, sounds, smells and very feel of the whole experience. Why only 4 stars for such great writing? The exposition gets boggy at times. Because there is so little information on the history of Krakatoa's first supposed explosions, extraneous supporting data had to be collected and explained, and that can be long-winded, meandering and at times tedious. But if you like history and don't mind some educational detours, Krakatoa... is well-worth your time. "
3,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Another masterful book by Simon Winchester. I really enjoyed this one – so much so that I’ve bought a copy for my father for Father’s Day. When I was in Primary School one of my teachers once spoke about Krakatoa. Most of what he said wasn’t true, for instance, he said that the tidal wave went around the world twice. Naturally, the 8 year old me had visions of a huge wall of water drowning the world. Krakatoa was bad, but not quite Biblical. Winchester is a pure delight to read. He has such a vast spread of interests and a keen (and unfailing) eye for the ludicrous and the amusing that it is hard to tell what delight is next in store. The discussion on the Circus that was in town at the time of the bang was magical – exactly the sort of thing that I find irresistible. The idea of the man who caught cannonballs for a living losing three fingers the first time he tried it – I mean, it is almost Pythonesque. But it is the breadth of themes that impresses the most about his books. This isn’t just a book about Krakatoa – as interesting as the parts of this book are that are directly about Krakatoa – but also about such topics as the growth of militant Islam in Colonial Indonesia, plate tectonics, the biological diversity of the Australian and Asian sides of the Indonesian Islands and the nature of the Dutch East Indies Company up until the time of the explosion. This would make a wonderful documentary series for television – I think geology is an utterly fascinating science and one which is so incredibly recent – much of what we ‘really know’ about this science we have only ‘really known’ since the mid-1960s. This book covers this by a man who played a minor part in one of the discoveries that made this new science come to be.But the stories about the people who survived the eruption – the boat loaded with paraffin trying to avoid hot rocks falling out of the sky, for example – sounded like something made up for a film staring Harrison Ford. I can see I’m going to have to read all of his books now – but what is one to do?"
4,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,5,"“Explosions like a battery of guns are heard… The lighthouse… is hit by a wave and destroyed, ripped off its base, leaving only an amputated stump of jagged masonry. An immense wave then leaves Krakatoa at almost exactly 10:00 A.M. – and then, two minutes later, according to all the instruments that record it, came the fourth and greatest explosion of them all, a detonation that was heard thousands of miles away and that is still said to be the most violent explosion ever recorded and experienced by modern man. The cloud of gas and white-hot pumice, fire, and smoke is believed to have risen… as many as twenty-four miles into the air.” – Simon Winchester, KrakatoaKrakatoa lies in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java, in current-day Indonesia. Winchester visited the area many years ago and returned recently to climb Anak Krakatoa, the ever-growing newest incarnation of the volcano that has arisen from the sea at the same location as the one destroyed in 1883. (Yes, he actually climbed the volcano and peered into its caldera.) He was inspired to research and document the history of Krakatoa and describe the cyclical process of rejuvenation. This book is a delightful mix of history, science, and sociology. Winchester provides a comprehensive look at the time period, what led up to the disaster, the tremendous explosion itself, and the resulting impact on the people and the environment. He also discusses political and biological aftermath in the area, some of which is surprising. The history of the period is examined in depth. Winchester covers the advances in telecommunications that enabled the story to be reported quickly rather than the two weeks in took in the past. He covers such history as the Dutch colonial rule of the area, natural resources, shipping methods, commerce, and past eruptions. He makes a case for Krakatoa as the beginning of the idea of the earth as a “global village.”It helps to have a strong interest in science, as Winchester goes into a detailed explanation of the scientific factors behind the disaster – plate tectonics, tsunamis, seismology, continental drift, subduction zones, and more. It is a thorough analysis – not for someone that wants the high-level overview. It is more oriented toward those that like to uncover the interconnections among seemingly discrete topics.This book is not a typical “disaster story,” though it does include eye-witness accounts and the extent of devastation. It does not tell the story by focusing on particular people and where they were. It is more focused on why the event occurred. The narrative does not arrive at the catastrophic explosion until the half-way point. If I have to pick a minor blemish, the sub-title does not convey the breadth of the book. It is much more extensive than what happened on a single day. Winchester tells the story in an erudite, engrossing, and educational manner. He excels at putting the event into its historical context. This book is well-researched – it includes an extensive bibliography and footnotes that are as interesting to read as the text. It contains all the elements I look for in non-fiction. I found it absolutely mesmerizing. "
5,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Over the weekend I read Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883, a book in which Simon Winchester has the gall to make fun of a geographically mistitled film called ""Krakatoa, East of Java,"" while himself failing to provide an adequate map of the region. There are historical maps, there are maps of where the sound of the explosion could be heard, there are numerous diagrams of fault-lines and continental and oceanic plates, and there is even a black-and-white reproduction of a painting showing a marvelously colorful post-Krakatoa sunset--but there isn't a single map showing where the volcanic island lay in respect to its near neighbors Java and Sumatra. Nor is there a map showing the pre-eruption island to scale, nor one showing the progress of the fatal tsunamis.That oversight could stand in for the faults of the book in general. Winchester reads like a fusty but enthusiastic professor whose interests rove over many disciplines. He deals with the history of the theories of evolution and plate tectonics, his own experiences researching paleomagnetism, the economics of the spice trade, telegraphy; he provides a lengthy history of the Dutch colonization of Indonesia. These sections are individually interesting, but they feel like the rote exposition of a disaster film: you just want to get to the explosion. Winchester seems to be so excited about providing a wealth of hors-d'oeuvres and desserts that he neglects the main course.The description of the explosion itself is made complicated by the way the author flips back and forth in time, telling each source's story in full before moving to the vantage point of the next observer. Nearly all of the sources are Dutch or English, though the English are no more than tangentially involved in the story. The more than thirty thousand Javanese who died in the tsunamis following Krakatoa's eruption receive short shrift, since the author is more interested in recounting the subsequent studies of doughty Englishmen with their barometers. He makes the interesting point that Krakatoa blew up at a crucial stage in the early history of telegraphy and wire news services but does not pursue the point more than anecdotally.The book was full of interesting information, but it felt slapdash, motivated by the author's indulgence of his own curiosities rather than his anticipation of the reader's. I came away from it with an intense desire to re-read what remains my favorite book about Krakatoa--fanciful though it is--The Twenty-One Balloons by William Pène du Bois."
6,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6401606-goldgato,3,"Krakatoa. Krakatoa! Krakatoa.Simon Winchester does it again. He lured me into purchasing this book because of the subject itself... the monstrous volcanic explosion that became the byword for catastrophe. And once again, Winchester let me down. The man does his homework, he gets the research done, and he has his facts in line. But. He. Is. Boring.How can a book about a volcano that obliterated an island and launched a massive killer tsunami be dull? I mean, Charlton Heston should be running through the pages or something. The reader should be cowering beneath the bedsheets with a flashlight, terrified of what might erupt from the next page to be turned. We're talking about a disaster that lifted a SHIP and carried it into the jungle, where it rested with its entombed sailors for decades. Wow.But. He. Is. Boring.Three stars for excellent research and factual knowledge, but a finger puppet re-enactment would be more thrilling.Book Season = Summer (never turn your back on the sea)"
7,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,2,"Krakatoa is a scientific history of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, a volcano located on a small island between Java and Sumatra in what is now Indonesia and what was then the Dutch East Indies. Like all Simon Winchester books, this one takes a long, erratic detour over the course of a couple hundred pages before actually reaching the point. That won't hinder your enjoyment of the book as long as you're not in a hurry, but I thought I should mention it.Winchester studied geology in college, and though he ended up working as a journalist, it's clear he's still passionate about the subject. As a science writer, he's really excellent. He explains the science behind volcanos, as well as the history of the study of plate tectonics, continental drift, and vulcanolgy. This is the most interesting part of the book. However, as a history writer, Winchester is, well, not so good. He omits large parts of the story; most notably, he barely mentions the actual Javanese and Sumatran people who lived in the area of Krakatoa until after the eruption itself. He treats the history of the area as if it started and ended with European colonialism. He draws specious conclusions without clear evidence. For example, he tries to link the eruption of Krakatoa with rise of anti-colonial sentiment at the end of the 19th century. This may have some truth in it, but he completely ignores the fact that anti-colonial movements in many part of the world increased during this time period. If Krakatoa had anything to do with it, it certainly played a rather small part.The part that annoys me most (no doubt because I am Muslim) is that Winchester portrays the native religion, Islam, with inaccuracy and dismissiveness (at best) and pure offensiveness at worst. He uses archaic terms such as ""Mohammedism"" and refers to things such as the ""Islamic Church"" and ""Islamic Priests"". Anyone with even a remote understanding of Islam knows that ""Mohammedism"" is an offensive and inaccurate term and there is no such thing as an Islamic church or a Muslim priest. He tries to draw a connection between the eruption of Krakatoa and the rise of ""radical Islam"" - though he seems to equate any serious practice of Islam (such as going on Hajj, one of the five pillars) with ""radical Islam"". He refers to the Indonesian people as ""converts"" to Islam rather than native practitioners - Islam has been a widespread religion in Indonesia for 800 years! By that standard, almost all Muslims are converts, along with most Christians. I could go on, but I will refrain. At times, I honestly felt like I was reading some colonial treatise from a hundred or two hundred years ago.To be fair, the chapter on Islam in Indonesia is just a small part of the book. It may not be entirely fair of me to rate this book down based on just one chapter. But then again, maybe I should judge Simon Winchester's work by his own standards: when discussing a historian who wrote about previous eruptions of Krakatoa, he criticizes him for a few inaccuracies and consequently discounts his entire work."

All gone. Plenty lives lost.
 That is the story of Krakatoa, only the 5th greatest volcanic explosion in history but probably the loudest. What intrigued me was Winchester’s assertion that this natural disaster was the first world-wide “social media” event. It happened at a time when communication technology enabled the news to be transmitted world-wide in a few hours through undersea telegraph cables. In the Victorian age, science was “sexy” and many amateur science aficionados are fascinated by this event. Long before McLuhan’s “global village”, this eruption captured the attention of the world. I’m giving the book 4 Stars. However, I can understand why many might find this a 2 Star read because you don’t get to the eruption until past page 200. And he wanders off the main theme many times before the big boom.Winchester takes you on a roundabout tour before arriving at 10:02 AM, Aug 27, 1883. Luckily, I was interested in most of the topics. First you get a history of discovery and the colonial claims to the resources of the area. Then you wander off to learn about the unusual biodiversity of the Wallace Line which then progresses to a discussion of geology. Follow the twists and turns leading to the final discovery of plate tectonics, a global theory that was finally established in 1965. But you won’t get to the volcano yet because he needs to explain the history of the telegraph and the undersea cables. And then he takes you into the news business and the rise of the Reuters News agency. How about a bit on the Lloyds insurance empire? Sure. Dutch colonial rule, Javanese suffering, racial prejudice, religion, circuses (say what?), cartography, previous explosions, ancient super-Krakatoa, origin of the name Krakatoa/Krakatowa/Krakatau. You get the picture. Lots of related information prior to the main event.The strongest part of the book is the description of the start of the eruption…which occurs 3 months before it blows up. In May of 1883, the island/mountain starts to come to life, culminating in the explosion heard almost 3,000 miles away. The pressure spike traveled around the world 7 times! The tsunamis did the most damage, killing over 35,000. The actual Krakatoa eruption and aftermath only cover about 150 pages, definitely not enough for me. But I want to visit Indonesia and see the area. Son of Krakatoa is building and will surely go off someday. Having lived near Vesuvius in Italy for 3 years, I can imagine the concern of those likely to be affected by any eruption. It is always in the back of your mind.The last part of the book is the weakest, attributing an Islamic rebellion against the Dutch to the aftermath of the eruption. Winchester makes a lot of allusions to harsh colonial rule by the Dutch but never really gets into specifics. This weakens his assertion on the short-lived rebellion. But I would like to learn more about the colonial era.Strong recommendation if you don’t mind wandering far afield. "
9,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4802663-deborah-ideiosepius,4,"In Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded Simon Winchester again weaves the subtle magic of telling a factual story with the fascination that is too often reserved for thrillers. Krakatoa is a real life thriller, the most long lastingly impressive volcanic eruption in so many ways and all are explored in this book.First there is the historical element; 1883 when the final eruption occurred is definitely historical, but recent enough that there are a lot of records and eye witness reports to draw from, so it is well documented history. Before the eruption is covered however we are given an insightful, in depth look at the social political situation in the region. How the Dutch came to be in power there, the wealth of the spice trade, the intricacies of the people living in the region, all these things are covered in sufficient detail that someone who is coming to the story with little actual knowledge of the region is well versed before Krakatoa is addressed.Then there is the geological story, the science of how volcanoes in general and Krakatoa in particular occur and behave, but in order to appreciate the science in the time of the eruption we are given the history of how geology rose to be the science it is today. And despite having read a fair bit of geology and plate tectonics I am always surprised all over again at how recently plate tectonics became recognised.So there is an awful lot of information surrounding the area and event before we reach the actual eruption. Now I personally love this type of storytelling, the long meander to discuss all the interesting things surrounding the event, so that when the main eruption happens there are no questions, no confusion. Despite enjoying this reading experience I am not blind to the fact that it takes time and attention to read: This is not a fact book that you can knock off in a couple of sessions, this requires attention to get the most out of it.When we reach the eruption it is breathtaking, exciting and all that was worth waiting for, totally worth the teasers in the lead up.The part in which Winchester describes the revolution that led to modern independent Indonesia is an eye opener. He links the regional rise of Islam and the Arabian peninsular's influence to the violence which, while it did lead to independence from colonisation in the region, is uncannily echoed by international Islamic behavior and goals. It was an eye opener for me because while I know Islam was a prevalent religion in Indonesia, I never knew how it came to be so. Now I know more.The section after the eruption was an unexpected joy: The detailed description of the geological changes and the successional biology of the islands re-establishing themselves was fascinating, as was the peak into the future of what might yet happen with Anak Krakatoa. All in all a long and satisfying reading experience."
10,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,3,"Entertaining, interesting and tedious (sometimes all at once), Winchester's take on the eruption of Krakatoa and its after effects is a smorgasbord of general geological history, historical re-enactment of the eruption and the end of Dutch colonialism in what is now known as Indonesia. With that said, my three star rating reflects some of my 'cons' with this book. He tends to repeat himself about specific things over and over and the chronology is off-putting (he goes back and forth between before and after the eruption and then back before causing slight confusion). I enjoyed learning about plate tectonics/continental drift theory once again, but I can see how some may find it tedious since Krakatoa isn't really referred to in detail until later on in the book.As I enjoyed The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary, this wasn't as enjoyable, but doesn't put me off him completely."
11,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33024987-betsy,4,"This book starts slowly, but really becomes interesting as the rumbles of Krakatoa become more ominous resulting in several eruptions. Eventually, most of the volcano disappears into the sea. Along with the eruptions, the area suffers a massive tsunami which causes a great loss of life. I've always been fascinated by volcanoes such as Krakatoa and Tambora so this was a good read for me. And with the reappearance of another volcanic cone, Anakrakatoa, presents the possibility of another devastating explosion."
12,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2315202-cameron,5,"I read this several years ago but remember it clearly. It is a terrific book and moves at a fast clip, The kind of book you can't put down. How an author can create such tension and awe when every reader knows what happened, is beyond me. Wonderful journalism and descriptions which put you in the middle of everything happening to the characters he discusses."
13,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15945083-nigel,4,"I found most of this extremely interesting and the author writes very well indeed. He manages to weave a number of threads into the basic story of this massive volcanic eruption. That said, for me, it was not quite as good as his story of China through the medium of the Yangtse.I found the section on continental drift went on a little too long and was beyond what I really wanted to know. Equally I thought the claim that the eruption caused a real shift in aspects of the world order interesting but rather brief. The detailed story of the eruption from those close by at the time was absolutely fascinating. I'll continue to read Winchester's books from time to time. "
14,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/856156-nicole,3,"I really wanted this book to be better than it was. While it has a lot of factual information about Krakatoa, it tells the tale with a number of sidetracks and blind alleys rather than in a linear fashion. At many points, it's hard to tell whether the author is relating something that happened before, during, or after the explosion.And, unfortunately, the explosion itself is a very small portion of the book. Winchester dedicates 64 pages to explaining the origins of continental drift theory. Why? Ostensibly because it's continental drift that causes Krakatoa to erupt. In reality, it seems Winchester does it in order to relate his own brief experience working in geologic research as an Oxford student, as well as his personal experiences rubbing elbows with some of geology's best-known names. Eliminating these 64 pages would have made this a tighter and more intersting book.Winchester does manage to tell the story in an interesting fashion once you get past that chapter. I just wish he (or his editor) wouldn't let himself go down so many blind alleys, and that he would be more clear when he was going backward and forward in time. Rather than telling the story in a linear fashion - here's what happened on the night of August 26 in these five different locations, here's the explosion, here's what happened in Batavia, Anjer, etc. after the mountain blew - he starts by telling us a little bit about what went on Sunday afternoon in Anjer, tells us a little about what happened in Batavia at that time, sidetracks for a couple of pages with information about the storage of natural gas and how it exhibits atmospheric pressure changes, moves over to ships on the ocean and tells their stories through the final explosion of Krakatoa, backtracks to early Sunday evening in Anjer, backtracks again to Sunday morning in Anjer, tells some of what happened to the ships from the perspective of someone on land, tells the Anjer story until about 6am, gives a bunch of one-sentence survivor anecdotes from the end of the event, backtracks to Monday monring, then back again to Sunday evening, then back to Batavia for the final twelve hours, then a full report on the Batavia situation from beginning to end, then back to Monday morning on Anjer, just before the final explosion...and so far we're only 30 pages into a 130-page chapter on the explosion! With all the back-and-forthing in time, it's often difficult for the reader to know what location and what point in time she is reading about.Winchester's biases are on full display, here, too, and they are troubling. One example, from page 15, as he discusses the colonization of what is now Indonesia:""The Portuguese from the warm and lazy south were slowly driven out and replaced by doughty Europeans from the cold and more ruthless north."" There's three things wrong with this sentence: It talks about the ""Portuguese"" and ""Europeans"" as separate peoples, making it sound like the Portuguese are not Europeans, it equates temperate climates with laziness, and it equates cold climates with both courage and ruthlessness. This kind of ethnotyping has been dumped in most academic fields over the past forty years, and for good reason. Other examples of stereotyping are found on page 145 (""It seems now a measure of the Chinese laborer's legendary tolerance for appalling working conditions..."" Tolerance, or desperation?)There are a number of points in the book where, by Winchester's word choice, he shows how little he thinks of Indonesians. It doesn't seem intentional, but it's distinct and noticeable. One example, from page 253: ""Each of those snared by the Telok Betong wave speaks of running, wildly, panicked, trying madly to stay ahead of the wave, following natives running wildly too..."" [italics mine:]. In this sentence, ""each of those"" should refer to all people, but it's clear from the sentence construction that Winchester is only referring to European people, because if the phrase ""each of those"" encompassed both Indonesians and Europeans, the bit I italiscized wouldn't follow.Notably, the only experiences Winchester uses here are the experiences of the Europeans. In part, this may be because he doesn't have facility with the languages spoken there and thus can't research the texts - but that's what a good research assistant is for.Really, I want to give this a 2.5. But I'll round it up to a 3."

This book is about the last great Global event right before the modern era of the industrial revolution. You learn so much and gain such an insight into this event that you can't help but feel smarter. Hell, you feel like you've earned your PhD. in Geology or some anthropological earth science by the time you reach the end of this bad mamma-jamma! If you have a few weeks of your life to waste (probably longer depending on how dry you like your reading) this is the book for you. I honestly do suggest it, it is a completely fascinating subject and the writer is very, very good. It does help to hear his voice on CSPAN or something. I saw him on there once and he had that educated English Oxford accent going on. Now I read his books and feel like I'm reading along with Masterpiece Theater!"
16,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,5,"A lot of the reviews I've read for this book criticize Winchester for being, well, slow. Slow to get to the action, or whatever.Well, this isn't that kind of book. Though it's written of a Hollywood blockbuster event, this isn't popular fiction. It's a scientist's approach to a worldwide calamity, and as a result of that, Winchester earns the right to be a bit slow and methodical, delving into the significance of Indonesia in the science of evolution and how the science of plate tectonics plays in the area. Personally, I loved his scientific delvings, even if they do ""slow"" the narrative down a bit."
17,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15659828-s,4,"when I first saw KRAKATOA some eight or whatever years ago, I flipped through it at the bookstore and thought it unimpressive. hardcovers are what, $25 these days, and if you think about it, that's four or five movies (depending on the theatre/ netflix or blockbuster) or it's a lobster dinner or its a night's stay at a guesthouse in bali or singapore. don't underestimate the power of $25 ! since that time, I've now read 7 full Simon Winchester books and have a copy of one or two more buried somewhere on the e-reader, and this wide-ranging, curious, evocative writer really deserves the praise he's received.as others have mentioned, Winchester's talent lies in immersing you in the world in which he describes. it's not just a matter of evoking the Dutch East Indies through smell and cuisine, as a merely competent reader can-- it's telling you period detail like the Krakatoa explosion was the first global-level news item to be carried across the recently-laid telegraph network-- it was the first ""breaking news"" so to speak, in an era when passenger pigeons were still being used to carry the dispatches across national lines and when gutta-percha-coated copper wires finally solved the problem of crossing the entire atlantic ocean with undersea cables.details like that-- and the simmering indonesian national identity; the evocative 'bare-breasted balinese girls who walked across black sands' in the actually existing south sea paradise before contemporary religion arose and ruined everything-- these kind of things draw you into the world Winchester is creating, and the result is a solid, master-level work of craftsmanship. 4/5 solid"

20,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark,4,"My father used to be a sailor before he retired, he did find himself all over the world and had a fascination with the sailing boats which was ironic at least him being a ships engineer. Another fascination he had was with countries and history, when I gave him this book about the explosion of the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa he was interested as it had to do with his favorite country where he was born and where he on a ship met my mom. And of course it had to do with a natural event that had a serious impact on the world around us that showed that humanity in the face of nature can only accept what is being dealt by nature.This book is about on of the better recorded volcano eruptions of modern times that really did make an impact on the whole world. On the 27th august 1883 Krakatoa an volcanic island near the Indonesian Island in the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Indonesian province of Lampung (at that time called Nederlands-Indie a colony of the Netherlands).With an estimated Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6, the eruption was equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT (840 PJ)—about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the Little Boy bomb (13 to 16 kt) that devastated Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.The 1883 eruption ejected approximately 25 km3 (6 cubic miles) of rock. The cataclysmic explosion was heard 3,600 km (2,200 mi) away in Alice Springs, Australia, and on the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius, 4,780 km (2,970 mi) to the west.What was left was a hole in the water an the island of Krakatoa was wholly disappeared in one large explosion. Eruptions in the area since 1927 have built a new island at the same location, named Anak Krakatau (which is Indonesian for ""Child of Krakatoa"").This book is about the times this event took place and the writer does his best to show us the geo-political situation at that time, where science was at when this happened and how it was experienced by people in recorded history. And of course the consequences in the aftermath in which the Banthen massacre was in my personal opinion was a bit of a stretch of including, albeit perhaps interesting to read about the Islam and its goals even back in the 19th century Asia.The book does linger a lot on tectonic plate theory that was in its infancy at that time and did become an explanation on the subject of earth and volcano's, the writer has managed to make even the more scientific explanations in this book understandable for the mere non-science people like me who still enjoy an interesting event and want to know more about it and its setting in history and implications. It is well written and researched book that does deliver a lot of information in a way that remains interesting through the whole book. An interesting look at the world of previous centuries with the knowledge that when it comes to volcanoes we can only watch and hope they do not erupt in your lifetime but like Pompeii that was build close to the Vesuvius Volcano there are major human settlements close to many volcanoes who were they to become active would almost certainly lead to a massive loss of life. And we can only hope that science does become better in predicting outbursts but if they are like Krakatoa the damage will be incredible in our modern times. An interesting book that describes humanity versus nature and humanity is interesting in the face of natures incredible power. Not only for historians but also for people who want to learn more of the world around them. "
21,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,4,"I learned about myself that I like science more than history. I would have said before I liked both equally. I think it's because people can be awful, and science is always awesome.There's a great deal of both in this book, with more than the first half of the book building a detailed picture of now-Indonesia as a Dutch colony, and the development of the science of vulcanology and plate tectonics, and much more. The social conditions at the time Krakatoa exploded, right at the beginning of a connected age, made the disaster one of the first global news stories. Also super neat to know that Edvard Munch's Scream was painted at the time of sunsets- when sunsets around the world were extra colourful and intense because of the ash from Krakatoa."
22,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714801-yael,5,"On August 27, 1883, an immense volcano on an island in the Sunda Straits of immense archipelago that was the Dutch East Indies (now called Indonesia) annihilated itself in an explosion that changed the world. Thousands of people in the vicinity of the volcano died right there; many more were made homeless and destitute as a result of it. The shock wave from that titanic explosion manifested as atmospheric pressure waves -- sound waves -- heard thousands of miles away, and the disaster was followed by an enormous tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. Dust generated by the eruption entered the atmosphere and was carried around the planet for years; the dust caused gorgeous, lurid sunsets with unsettling displays of light, but it also made global temperatures plummet, with consequent losses of crops, disastrous levels of snow and rain in many areas of the world followed by massive erosion and destruction of habitat, and countless other catastrophes. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Washington, DC and Bogata went crazy in reaction to the horrendous atmospheric shockwaves generated by the event. The sound of the eruption was heard in places as far away as Australia, India, and islands thousand of miles away. And the eruption combined with other causes, such as brutal treatment of native populations by the Dutch, to trigger a wave of a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among Java's fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first modern outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere.Krakatoa has done this before in various incarnations. In Catastrophe: An Investigation Into the Origins of the Modern World (previously reviewed here on this site), David Keys describes the global havoc wrought by such an eruption in the Sunda Straits in 535 AD, made far worse than that caused by the eruption of 1883 by lack of rapid transit and communications of the sort that were available in the second half of the 19th century. Krakatoa, known among volcanologists as a supervolcano because of its size at eruption and its potential for destruction, shares with the Yellowstone, Wyoming, Long Valley, California, and Naples, Italy volcanic domes (http://www.solcomhouse.com/yellowston...) the ability to caused worldwide disasters over periods of many years, thereby heavily impacting human civilization and human populations over most of the Earth, and wreaking havoc on the habitats and ways of life of most of the Earth's other creatures. Its eruptions have literally changed the course of history, and may have altered the course of the evolution of our species and numerous other life-forms, Earth-bound versions of large impact events due to comets and asteroidal materials.Unlike the Yellowstone supervolcano, however, Krakatoa's last two monstrous eruptions occurred within the last two thousand years. The last Yellowstone eruption occurred 2.1 million years ago, well before the rise of modern hominids leading to Homo sapiens. The most recent eruption of Krakatoa occurred only 125 years ago, well after the rise of modern Western industrial civilization, the invention of the telegraph, and the proliferation of railroads throughout the world, a time when European and British colonization of large areas of Asia and Africa had been underway for centuries, and the political currents of the time were delicately balanced, just waiting for a good, hard push to send them roaring into new channels. In the Dutch East Indies, the eruption of Krakatoa provided that push, resulting in massive riots against the Duth masters of the people of that area that ultimately culminated in the downfall of much of the Netherlands' most profitable colonial endeavors.The impact of the eruption on global weather patterns translated into a vast impact on the world economy and the economies of countless nations and empires, including the largest. The ecological dynamics of the Earth's wildlands and the productivity of cultivated lands were disrupted for years, possibly driving many wild species of animals and plants to extinction. Crops were destroyed and large herds of domestic animals raised for their meat and milk were killed throughout the human world, which in turn heavily impacted human politics and economics and the lives of millions of people.However, there was an upside to this disaster: scientific advances in numerous fields due to what was learned about the eruption of Krakatoa, and what it said about natural processes everywhere. This scientific fallout from the event wasn't long in coming. Because of the speed of communication in the Victorian Age, thanks to the telegraph, and more rapid transit by train and ship because of which scientists could journey to the area where the eruption had occurred and observe the damage it caused and the characteristics of the volcano itself first-hand, data from the event and its aftermath began to flow into the world's universities and research institutions within a relatively short time, months as opposed to the literal centuries or even millennia it has taken for us to begin to understand what earlier eruptions of supervolcanoes like the Yellowstone Dome have done to the world. Some of that data has had to wait for more recent observations and the invention of the most modern scientific techniques and equipment for a complete understanding of their implications, but even in the closing decade of the 19th century, the international scientific community was gaining new and important insights about tectonic processes and their effects on the world thanks to the eruption of Krakatoa.Even so, Krakatoa, or rather Anak Krakatoa, ""Child of Krakatoa,"" a volcano that has been growing for years on the site of the 1883 eruption of its parent, may have more lessons to teach us about our vulnerability to natural disasters and just how helpless we are to prevent the occurrence of many of them. Krakatoa has blasted our world in one incarnation after another, and will do so again. The only question is, ""When?"" And when it erupts, in all its awesome power, it could deliver a body-blow to our modern high-tech civilization, so dependent on intensive farming and high-tech gadgetry that can be bollixed and made useless by anything from eruptions on the Sun to local atmospheric effects, that would leave millions or even billions dead and the rest in serious trouble. Can we prepare against that? Probably not -- look at our difficulties in preparing for hurricanes and earthquakes, and cleaning up their damage afterwards. Those happen all the time. No one wants to spend the tax money for one-off, relatively rare events like the most massive solar flares, huge tsunamis, impacts of heavenly cannon-fire, and the eruption of supervolcanoes rather than than using the money to deal with the worst that the atmosphere and earthquake faults can deliver. And so we set ourselves up for disaster."
23,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1455178-cd,3,"Dependable historical story telling can be a dry glass in a desert for many readers. Winchester is a very fine writer, fine to the point of absurdum with descriptions that sometime take him down a path that does not always work on the written page. Having heard him speak and listened to his reading of his works it both pushes my rating of this back to 3 stars and down to 3 stars at the same time.Nothing is left out it seems from this story, but where detail and richness of information is lacking Winchester in few cases becomes overly brief. That is my one main criticism of his writing overall and I may be alone in thinking that but you can tell he wants to say more but the facts are not available. Sure, in this story the witnesses perished and details are drawn for certain portions from telegrams/wire reports from those a great distance and some who perished. Historically Winchester seems faithful and the storytelling suffers. In other circumstances the narrative becomes consumed by the details of vulcanology and what we know currently and what was believed or felt at the time of the incident in Java.Persevere in reading this book and it will improve and reward those who complete the tale. Winchesters style once appreciated for its superlative use of language will finally disappear behind the storytelling."
24,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1248986-evan,0,"I started reading this and kind of zoned out really fast. This is one of those books -- all too common now -- where the chronicler seems hellbent on going back far into time and detailing various tangentially relevant incident before finally deciding to bring it all home somewhere near the end. I'm sure that descriptions of flora and fauna and the history of trade routes have their place, but not to this extent. Why must every author have to be the ""chronicler of record"" and weigh their books down in excessive minutiae? I notice biographers of famous people, including movie stars, now seem obliged to no longer merely start with ""so and so was born"" and instead go back to the fucking Norman invasion or some such and chronicle the whole damned family tree like ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" or something. I picked this up because I wanted to read about a disaster. I want blood and guts and big 'plosions, goddamnit! Maybe I'll try it again someday using my patented ""select and skim"" methodology."
25,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"Informative book on an interesting subject, but way too padded with tangential subjects, like spice trade, Dutch colonialism, tectonic plate science history, Islamic revolution in Indonesia, etc. Understandably, all of these are important to see the big picture of Krakatoa's role in political, cultural, and economic histories of the geographical area, but these digressions are often distracting. The actual meat of the book is lean and spread out thin, which makes it quite easy to put the book aside and forget it for a few days. I couldn't concentrate on the writing for longer periods of time at once. Seriously, it took me too long to read this. "

The book consumed almost 400 pages because it likewise dealt with topics related to the volcano, and volcanoes in general.There were chapters about spices and the spice trade. Spices are the in thing at that time, and the area where Krakatoa was was where most of the spices were harvested at that time. Naturally, the Europeans competed with each other in this spice trade and somehow it was the Dutch who gained foothold in that part of the world where Krakatoa was.There were chapters also about flora and fauna. Some scientists of those days studied that part of the world and noticed that there seems ot be an invisible line separating islands there so that in one side of this imaginary line/boundary you can't find some plants and animals which can be found in the other side of this imaginary line.Later, and explanation was found. Plate tectonics and the continental drift. It turned out, there were really lines, i.e., tectonic plates have boundaries even if their boundaries may be hidden deep in the oceans. Billions of years ago, there was one great land mass in the entire world. Then it divided into several ""plates"" until the present land masses we know today. some of these plates push one another and form mountains like Mount Everest. But some plates are ""softer"" than others. And when a ""soft"" plate meets a ""harder"" one, the former has the tendency to dive under. It is in such a point where the most active and ruinous volcanoes are found[that is why there are so many volcanoes in this part of Asia, from Japan downwards to the Philippines and Indonesia. Soft plate meets a hard plate here, so there's the so-called ""Ring of Fire"" in this part of the world:]. Like Krakatoa.Krakatoa was said to have had violent explosions before 1883 but the evidence on this were scant. Before it's 1883 explosion, it was a big, island volcano. After it exploded, the entire island [except for a small part:] disappeared. It apparently was pulverized or was melted by the force of the explosion.The sounds created by the explosions were heard in Manila, Vietnam and even in that small island near Diego Garcia. It was said to be the loudest natural sound ever heard by human beings ever.Do you know also that that explosion contributed to the rise of Muslim fundamentalism? And hatred by some Muslims of non-muslims especially foreigners? Read the book to find out."
31,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20317955-kyle-levenick,1,"I couldn't do it. I couldn't finish this book.Go ahead and lambaste me for reviewing a book I couldn't finish, but you know how it goes: too many books to waste time reading bad ones.It has fascinating potential, it's been on my ""to-read"" list for almost two years at this point. I couldn't wait to crack it open. Boy was I immediately disappointed. I like a long walk in a book, and Winchester points to the setting sun, whispers ""we'll get there, I promise,"" and takes you by the hand for a mosey the long way around. He seems like a great guy, a literal knight in khaki armor. He takes it easy, helping you step over new ideas while exercising a knack for anecdotal tangentiality. But every so subtly, it slips though. Something isn't right here. A description of plantation life is accompanied by a whistful sigh. An aside describing a native name not sounding ""as nice."" Before you know it, the return path is obscured by previous topics that were carelessly tossed aside and Winchester is holding you by the cheeks, forcing your gaze forward while chanting ""I know what I'm doing. Look at me.""Miles begin to pass like inches, connections are made between the apocalypse and the rise of Islam (but he's just telling you what he heard from a friend), and the more he regales about the efficiency of Dutch colonial administration, the tighter you see his khaki shorts become.When I awoke, I had no recollection of my escape and no desire to question it. I was free of the imperialphilic spectre's grasp, for now. There would be others, and the basaltic ruins of Anak Krakatoa are surely littered with the remains of others, dizzied and left for sacrifice at the altar of Winchester.But really, this book is far too saturated with outright dismissals of native culture, knowledge and history, while favoring a near masturbatory praise for colonialism. Ironically, while Winchester blasts the Javanese poet Ranggawarsita for being an apparently sycophant to his patrons, Winchester's Krakatoa comes off as a desperate plea for the ghosts of his imperial heroes to glide down from heaven and cradle him in their arms, cooing and gently reminding him of the time when things were better."
32,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/787657-ben,2,"When the author sticks to the science of the events leading up to and following the explosion of Krakatoa, they book is fine. The author traces the history of the science of geology and volcanoes (though there are a few awkward moments where we get to hear about how the author intersected with these discoveries) and tries to explain why Krakatoa exploded so violently. He also attempts to uncover from conflicting and anecdotal evidence if there were any previous eruptions, which is also interesting.Where the book falls down is when he gets to the human history of Indonesia. For the author, the history of islands begins when Europeans arrived, and he barely mentions the indigenous population. He does not even examine the influence of Islam on the island until 9/10 of the way through the book. Further, when he does briefly touch on the revolutions and attacks on the Dutch post explosion, it is framed as external forces from Mecca were inciting the people to revolution, with just a brief mention of possible exploitation of the island population by the Dutch. The book so ignores the everyone who is not European it should likely be called ""Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded and How it Affected the Dutch and the English."""
33,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5045882-gary-oneill,0,"This is a work of non-fiction about one of the hugest volcanic eruptions that has ever happened since there were humans on the planet. Krakatoa (between Java and Sumatra in Indonesia) erupted in 1883, a massive explosion that could be heard in Mauritius - 3000 kilometers away! The eruption and the resulting tidal wave killed 35000 people and it threw so much volcanic dust into the atmosphere that there were amazing sunsets for three years after the eruption.I found the book fascinating. The writer, Simon Winchester, is such an excellent researcher and he has a lightness of touch that makes his work comfortable to read even when he is describing the technical side of volcanic science. In addition to the scientific information, Winchester writes about the human side of the disaster - how the Dutch and Indonesian people reacted to the event. He paints a fascinating picture of life in 'the Dutch East Indies.'I would recommend this book to anyone who is fascinated by the immense power of the forces at work below the surface of the Earth, and to anyone who enjoys colonial history."

Rich with stories of people, social and economic history, ecology and geology. Perhaps there was a bit more information that could have been gleaned and described on secondary climatic impacts on things such as agricultural outputs, certain bodies of water freezing that don't usually, etc. This is the second historical book by Simon Winchester I have read recently (see my review of 'The Madman and the Professor""). I very much like his interesting topic choices, broad research and easy writing style."

But I'd forgotten most of this and figured it's about science, surely it will be fine.*laughs bitterly*While I don't regret rereading this, it's less that Winchester is weird about women and more that he perceives and portrays anyone not a white Christian man as very Other. In this book, he is weird about women and racist and I honestly can't believe I read Muslims referred to as Muhammadans in a book published in the 21st century. It is gross and disappointing that his editors didn't make him change it.I assume all of the science was good; it's Winchester's background and not mine. Much of the book was science or retelling events about the eruption without much social commentary. It's an interesting story and one worth telling. But the parts about the colonial history and the uprisings after the eruption were also important, yet so weighed down by the racism that I can't actually recommend anyone read this book."

The author sometimes going down rabbit holes very deep, but the rabbit holes always have something that ties them back to the eruption. The history of how Samuel Morse developed telegraphic communication (which allowed reporting of the Krakatoa eruption to occur VERY close to the time of the actual event), the history of geology and meteorology leading to the understanding of plate tectonics and discovery of the jet stream, the understanding of how life returns to a volcanic island after all has been burned away (or has all life been burned away?).... it is a very dense narrative but it all ties up and is very worthwhile.Some items of interest that I have marked down to investigate further -- the Wallace Line, discovered by Alfred Russel Wallace, which delineates the zones between Australia and Asia. Birds, beetles, plants on the east side of the line are related to Australian flora and fauna..... Those on the east side of the line are related more to Asian flora and fauna. The distance between these birds or insects is sometimes miles.... very close, yet they are totally different and do not intermix. Fascinating!Also the discovery and mapping of the jet stream due to the particulate matter thrown into the atmosphere during the eruption. The temperatures in the northern hemisphere dropped 2 degrees F in 1883 - 1884. Krakatoa is the FIFTH strongest volcanic eruption, which means four that have come before were more severe... but they were not as well documented or studied. Want to look into previous eruptions like the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora which caused ""The Year without Summer"" in 1816.

Krakatoa was the largest recorded volcanic explosion in history, killing 36,000 people and sending so much ash and pumice into the stratosphere–miles above the surface of the earth–that it blocked out the sun for years causing the earth’s temperature to cool by several degrees (as recorded in polar ice caps and tree rings around the globe). The stratospheric ash also caused lurid sunsets as far away as North America and Europe and drifted back to earth all over the planet. The sound of the volcano was heard and recorded on an island off the coast of Africa, 3,000 miles away; that’s the distance from New York City to San Francisco. The ensuing tsunami destroyed many islands and cities and threw boats onto hills several hundred feet above sea level; the tsunami wave (which gets smaller the farther it travels) was measured as far away as the English Channel. During an earthquake the shock waves travel through the earth’s crust, hence the shaking. When a volcano explodes those shock waves travel through the air wreaking havoc on barometric meters, which in 1883 were used as a backyard hobby to predict weather throughout the European colonies. Using that data, it was determined that the shock wave from Krakatoa traveled around the world 7 times before it became too small to measure. SEVEN TIMES! And–and this is my favorite fun-fact–when Krakatoa exploded the volcano was about 3,000 feet above sea level. When the dust and ash and clouds finally cleared, the island and the two surrounding it were gone, completely disappeared. However, in 1927 sailors noted that the nose of a new volcano-island was peeping over the waves. It was christened Anakrakatoa, which means “Child of Krakatoa” in Malay, and that volcano grows–on average–five inches a week. It is now almost 2,000 feet tall. FIVE INCHES A WEEK! THE MOUNTAIN! IT GROWS FIVE INCHES A WEEK! You guys, I can’t get over how awesome this book is. The reason I cannot award 5 stars, however, is because towards the end Winchester strays from solid subjects like the history of Dutch and British colonization in Indonesia to capitalize on the spice trade, or the history of volcanoes around the world, or evolution, or plate tectonics and delves into some hogwash about how Islamic jihad in Indonesia was a direct result of the volcano. (No, it wasn’t. It was a direct result of Europeans colonizing and being economic hogs and treating local and native peoples like second or third rate citizens, and/or selling them as slaves throughout their empires, and the same revolutions that happened in South-East Asia happened throughout the rest of the colonized world…the world that didn’t have massive volcanic explosions.) This book was published in 2003, after 9/11 but before the tsunami that hit Thailand. Winchester’s focus on Islam and his excessive explanations of tsunamis and how rare they are reflect that. You could probably skip those parts and have a much better experience with this book."
43,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"The reader of this book learns about plate tectonics, bio-diversity, the Wallace Line, and history of the Dutch East Indies Company before reaching the big explosion. Then there's the false start, followed later by the big blast, and then all sorts of stories follow. Then there's more science lessons about tsunamis, shock waves, jet stream, and other stuff. The author strings all these topics together into a most fascinating tale.I thought the author pushed things a bit too far when he suggested that Krakatoa played a part in the rise of militant Islam in Colonial Indonesia. Anti-colonial feelings were widespread throughout the world, even in countries with no volcano. I found the book's description of the reemergence of the island of Krakatoa in the 20th Century less interesting. His account of visiting the island in person was particularly uninteresting. Perhaps the author was trying too hard to meet a goal of a certain number of pages.Here's what I find scary. It's going to happen again. That particular spot may not blow in our lifetime, but a similar type of explosion somewhere in that part of the world could very well happen. And Krakatoa isn't the biggest volcano that we know of. Tambora in 1815 was the largest explosion to occur in the past 1000 years and was about twice as big as Krakatoa in 1883. The difference with Krakatoa was that it occurred in the modern era so that news of it spread quickly via telegraph communications. There were also many witnesses in the vicinity and throughout the world who recorded their observations.As late as 1963 another book was written about Krakatoa that described what happened, but couldn't offer much of explanation as to why volcanoes occur. As it turns out, 1964 was the first year that the theory of plate tectonics first began to be widely accepted by the scientific community. I can remember when I was in grade school (during the 1950s) I commented on the fact that the east coast of South America appeared to mirror the shape of the west coast of Africa. The obvious conclusion was that they used to touch each other. I was assured at the time that scientists said that continents don't move. For once I was smarter than the experts.The following short review is from the 2005 PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:
KRAKATOA: THE DAY THE WORLD EXPLODED: AUGUST 27, 1883,
 by Simon Winchester (HarperCollins, 2003). It is conventional in natural-disaster books to focus on a few individuals and tell the story of the cataclysm through their eyes. Simon Winchester has found a better approach: He begins with the geological forces that caused the Krakatoa volcano to explode with such violence. As a result, as you move through the story, you are on pins and needles, waiting for the catastrophe to strike (very much in the way a reader anticipates the next shark attack in Jaws). A dynamic tale that you will find very hard to put down. "
44,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23233462-clare-o-beara,5,"What I like about this book is that it's not just volcanism or the history of one location. Like a huge jigsaw puzzle, the tale brings together all the colonisation and advances in science that were happening right then, right there, and connecting the world more swiftly and thoroughly than ever. From the naturalists who were discovering continental drift theory as a way of accounting for different flora and fauna on different islands in one archipelago, to understanding magma chambers under volcanoes, to laying the first undersea cables, we see a broad sweep of progress. So many sciences and advances are explained or referenced throughout the tale that the dendrochronology and ice core sampling which can prove air gas content and ash identification only make a footnote. The people of the day are excited, progressive and adventurous. Travel and ex-pat life are not without danger, while the end of colonisation is signalled. Illustrations include maps, photos and some paintings and sketches of the day. Tying all this together is the ominous peak of Krakatoa, the island which actually contained a few peaks and was growing from what turned out to be the remnants of a former volcano. The tension mounts and the eruption as described is staggering. The world cooled and had dust fall - adding to soil fertility, I would think - for a few years afterwards. The author tells us of seeing Ana-Krakatoa, the child of the volcano, growing in the water channel, ready to turn into another timebomb. This certainly seems to me to be the only reason there are any Sumatran rhinos left. The endangered mammal has been pushed further into a small area of Sumatra which is a nature reserve, solely because it is the next piece of land to the new volcano. Let's remove some rhinos from the island to breed elsewhere as a reservoir of genetic material. This book is not recommended for those who only want to know about the explosion or who like a quick read. If like me you enjoy learning about everything, especially the development of sciences, the natural world and how it interconnects, you will love Krakatoa. Try also Snowball Earth, The Keys of Egypt and The Seashell On The Mountaintop. "
45,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge,3,"Book on CD read by the author.3.5*** On August 27, 1883 the volcano Krakatoa exploded in a cataclysmic eruption that literally annihilated the island. The explosion resulted in more deaths than any other natural disaster – over 36,000 people lost their lives (most due to the resultant tsunami). This is a natural history of the island, the geological forces that led to its formation, destruction and rebirth, and the aftermath of that event. The enormous magnitude of this eruption is hard to imagine. Dust swirled around the planet for years, resulting in blood-red sunsets as far away as England. Average temperatures dropped worldwide. Barometers in Washington DC and in Columbia were affected. Bodies floated on pumice “islands” as far away as Zanzibar. The sound of the blast was heard in Australia and on islands thousands of miles away. The most surprising effect, to me at least, was the political unrest. A Muslim zealot had predicted a series of events that would herald the coming of the Mahdi and a holy war against the infidel. The eruption and its aftereffects seem to be an exact fit for this prophecy. And the slow response of the ruling Dutch colonists to assist those displaced and injured by the disaster helped fuel in Java a wave of anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims; one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings followed. Winchester is a geologist as well as a writer, and so is the perfect person to pen this history. However, he seemed determined to include every bit of scientific research he uncovered. The reader must wade through 150 pages (over 3 discs) of background before the eruption begins; I found myself talking back to the CD player “when is it going to explode?!” I’m sure I was influenced by having seen the PBS show about the volcano; I was expecting more action. Still it’s a fascinating story and I was mesmerized for most of it. Winchester narrated the audio version himself. He does a very a good job of this, though he does tend to sound like a professor delivering a lecture in many sections. The text version has quite a few illustrations and maps which cannot be part of the audio book. The audio also left out the many footnotes (which is NOT a bad thing). "
46,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854592-judy,4,"On August 27, 1883, the volcanic island of Krakatoa, located in the Sundra Straits in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), exploded. The explosion, devastation, tsunamis, and shock waves killed almost 40,000 people and affected the entire world. Shock waves were detected around the world and high sea waves hit the shores of France and the English Channel. Dust that was hurled miles into the atmosphere from the explosion of the volcano kept full sunlight from reaching the earth, causing global temperatures to fall drastically. This produced widespread crop failures, record levels of snow and rain that caused severe erosion, and habitat transformations around the globe. And the sound of the explosion could be heard as far away as Japan, India, and Australia. One positive result of the disaster in Krakatoa was the cooperation of scientists from around the world who began to share knowledge and cooperate in such fields as geophysics and the study of tectonic plates. Simon Winchester places the explosion of Krakatoa in its historical context. Readers also get an eduation in geology, plate tectonics, and volcanic activity. This book is long and technical, yet I couldn't put it down. I had heard about Krakatoa, certainly, but had no idea of the severity of the diaster and the world-wide effects. "

Lots of details -the likes of the history of Batavia, early colonialism, etc- that I think interesting despite my genuine expectation regarding the book was merely about the eruption.Yet somehow I like the, as a friend said in her review, the OOT parts of this book, for me, quite entertaining. But to be honest not all of them, just a bit.If somehow Mr. Winchester, you're reading this, you should consider an official demand of typo-free in your future translated works.

48,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13908931-ariel,4,"I really liked this book. Winchester's style was enjoyable and I felt like I learned quite a bit in several areas. I wasn't really sure what to expect from Winchester's work. I haven't read any of his other books and, besides a few biographies, I'm not a huge nonfiction reader. I really wanted to change that this year which was why this was moved up my TBR list and I'm glad it was. It did feel like there was some heavy repetition in areas. Both in information and in how the author phrased certain things. However, I don't feel like it took too much away from the overall feel of the project. Plus, you can tell, even in these areas, that Winchester has a lot of passion for his subject and it's this passion that keeps you hooked. I do think the topic-hopping style might annoy some readers who are looking for a more pinpointed read. However, those that enjoy the info plunge of various subjects and the culmination of such will definitely enjoy this book. I think Winchester struck a pretty good balance between personality and really getting into the grit of his subject. "
49,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3748-kalilah,3,"Interesting and filled with a ton of fun facts, but perhaps 100 pages longer than it needs to be. There are a number of moments when Winchester goes off on a random tangent or includes a detailed footnote about something unexpected and fascinating but for every one of those there are three such instances where the tangents just feel cumbersome and unnecessary. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he was being paid by the world. In any case, if you have any interest in learning about volcanology, the history of the Dutch East Indies or about plate tectonics, then this is certainly the book for you. However, be prepared for a bit of a slog at times, as Winchester goes to absurdly great detail about certain elements and makes wildly speculative assumptions about the feeling, motivations and actions of individuals involved with very aspects of the narrative he's laboriously put together. "
50,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7044881-russell,4,"Winchester weaves a large set of elements into a very readable, well-paced story about the explosion of Krakatoa in the late 1800's. Along the way, you will learn about geology's somewhat grudging acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics, the distribution and grouping of species, and the effects of Dutch colonial rule in the East Indies. As for the explosion itself, Winchester pulls together reports close up and far away to document the incredible instant of the volcano's destruction, when cubic miles of material literally disappeared into the air and sea. This book entertains while it teaches, a compelling combination."
51,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,4," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com With Krakatoa Simon Winchester gives a very interesting account not only of the actual eruption of the Krakatoa and its immediate aftermath, but also spend a lot of time to set the scene and look into consequences of the eruption. It was the first book I read by Simon Winchester and I enjoyed it a lot. Not everything was new information for me, but I liked the writing and the general pace of the book. I would recommend it."
52,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,3,"This book about the cataclysm that was Krakatoa started out well but quickly became a little too technical for my tastes. There were sections that, frankly, I skipped through.........it's not that I don't find information about tectonic plates interesting, but there was just more detail than I needed to know. This issue aside, the book was informative and provided excellent detail about this catastrophe and its effect on the population and environment."
53,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6410322-jodi,3,"Once he finally gets to the eruption (around page 153), it's very interesting. I recommend skimming."
54,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6328907-chelsea,4,"More reviews available at my blog, Beauty and the Bookworm.Natural disasters hold a fascination for me, just as they do for many others. They're terrible in the destruction they wreak, sometimes on a global scale, and yet it's hard to look away. And of course the underlying forces behind the disasters are fascinating in their own right. Volcanoes are one of the biggest cases of natural disasters, and among them the name ""Krakatoa"" has its own sort of mystique. Like many others, I first encountered Krakatoa in the children's book The Twenty-One Balloons. I don't remember a lot about the story, except that it involed a group of Europeans who lived on a volcanic island in the Pacific (the island was misplaced in the book; Krakatoa was actually located in the Indian Ocean in the Sunda Straight) who had crazy houses, and had to flee on a big balloon platform and parachute down to the new places they wanted to live when the volcano that loomed over the island exploded. All these years later, when I wanted a nonfiction palate cleanser from a particular book hangover I was suffering (thank you, Hunted), I decided that the real story of Krakatoa would be a good candidate. But the thing is, not a heck of a lot is actually known about Krakatoa. Not many people within distance of actually witnessing its explosion survived; instead, all but a handful were killed by the massive tsunamis (up to a hundred feet high) that pummeled the coasts of both Java and Sumatra and killed probably thirty-five thousand people--only about a thousand died from the usual volcanic killers, such as pyroclastic flows. But these figures, again, mean that there aren't a lot of witnesses. Instead, witnesses were limited to a handful of survivors who outran tsunamis (very impressive) and were on ships large enough to ride out the perilous seas in the wake of the eruption. In addition, not enough was known about volcanology in the late nineteenth century to really document the causes of the eruption. And, unfortunately, Krakatoa was almost entirely destroyed in the eruption, leaving behind only half of one of its three peaks. So, while another island has begun to emerge (called the Son of Krakatoa) there's not enough of the original left for modern geologists to examine it for potential insights about the famed eruption. Because of these informational deficits, Winchester bulks out his volume with some of the history of Indonesia, though only its colonial parts. The focus here is very much on the Dutch colonizers, barely touching on the native population at all except to mention local superstitions about volcanoes and one chapter about the growing resistance that spread in the wake of Krakatoa's eruption, which probably contributed to the resistance (though saying that the eruption caused the resistance, as Winchester muses at one point, is probably a stretch). He also explains the history of botany in the region and a larger chunk of the book is contributed to a history and explanation of the theory (in this use, theory being fact, as it is used in science) of plate tectonics. Some of this was interesting, and I think it probably is needed in some form for a book of this nature, but the sheer amount of page time devoted to it seemed a bit excessive when a simpler explanation could have accomplished the same understanding. Then there's the writing. Some of it is vivid and engaging. Some of it is dry as dirt and I found myself skimming paragraph after paragraph. There doesn't actually appear to be much rhyme or reason to when the writing is good and when it's a bit rough, either. The good and bad parts both appear in all parts of the book, in all topics. The drier bits do seem to have some issues with structure, which seems to be an editing problem or at least a problem that should have been weeded out during editing; they're frequently confusing in how they're written and there are a lot of weird paragraph breaks that didn't seem to really be necessary. And one big thing did bother me: I had no idea where Krakatoa actually was. This book has a wealth of illustrations, photographs, diagrams, and maps, but despite all of that I found myself pulling up Google Maps to figure out where all of this was actually taking place--Krakatoa not being labelled on any of the wider maps of the region, and not enough specificity being given for me to envision it without a proper map. Still, the story of this remarkable mountain was intriguing, enough to have me neglecting another book to read it. That said, you have to go into it with the awareness that the portion about the eruption itself and its direct consequences is not very long at all. I'm pretty used to this from history books, which never seem to focus as much on their titular subjects as one would think, but I can definitely see it bothering others, so reader beware in that respect. 4 stars out of 5.

This is an event I knew hardly anything about, Thumbing through it before buying it, it seemed a good choice. I don't regret buying or reading it, however, there is more to this book than the eruption of Krakatoa and the devastation that resulted from it. The first 150 pages gives an in-depth history of the Dutch Colonization of what we now know as Indonesian. Also among this section Winchester somehow gets off topic and tells the history of Lloyds of London, and Rueters News. It is a trial to get through if you were not expecting it. The writing of the history, the story was just fine- a lot of fun facts-just not what I was expecting.Half-way through we finally get to the meat of the story-UGH now we are bogged down with a million and one scientific terms and explanations. I love how another reviewer put it ""extraneous supporting data that was collected and explained, and that can be long-winded, meandering and at times tedious. "".The last section of the book delves into how Krakatoa also ""erupted"" the political climate in this area of the world. The population of Muslims in this area of the world is quite large, however in the early 19th century their practice of Islam was much different than what we know today. A lot of mystical beliefs were combined with religion. Some Javanese believe(d) that Java's location is the closest area where Heaven and Earth meet-thus there can be transmissions to and from the two spheres. Many believed the eruption of Krakatoa was a sign that End Of Days were upon us. Winchester makes a connection between fanatical Islam and the eruption. All of this was very interesting-but the story of Krakatoa, what I was looking for- was only a small piece of this book. Do I understand photodissociation or plate tectonics any better-absolutely not. If you are a science nerd, you may enjoy this book a bit better than I did. If all you want is the story of Krakaoa, I would look elsewhere. I gave the book 3 stars for being well written and 1/2 star for the fun facts I learned a long the way."
56,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44245731-jacqueline,3,"At least the first 40-50% of this book is a deep-dive in stage-setting. A deep dive. Krakatoa exploded in August 1883 after a few months that signaled something bigger was coming, but the author backtracks far earlier—as far back as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—to cover angles like soil composition, local exports, slave trading routes, tectonic plates, and on and on and on. Some of it is helpful and relevant, but many of his diatribes (including his own hiking adventures and drunken academic conference dinners) are unnecessary and tedious. The real story of Krakatoa begins after wading through these many pages when in May of 1883, the volcano begins to awaken. These details are curious and horrifying, facts like of the 35,000 people killed, 34,000 were killed not directly from the volcano’s lava or smoke but from the massive tsunamis it instigated. The six-mile stretch of the volcano’s mountainous site completely disappeared after its explosion, until the volcano started reforming as Anak Krakatoa (“son of Krakatoa”) in the late 1920s. The massive boom of the explosion was heard as far as 2,900 miles away, and it set off disturbances in sound and shock waves worldwide for 15 days. If you can be patient with the beginning—or better yet, skip it—this section of the book is well-researched and fascinating, but once again the last 20% or so of the book dovetails and the interest level wanes."
57,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9819047-julia,3,"I remember this book being very popular about fifteen years ago - you couldn't miss it if you frequented Barnes and Noble or Borders (remember those days?). I finally got around to reading it and Winchester's book on the infamous volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 was highly informative. Winchester places Krakatoa into its historic context, examining colonialism and Indonesia's former Dutch occupation. He also examines geology, vulcanology, plate tectonics, botany, zoology, and many other sciences, thus making sense of why Krakatoa exploded. I especially liked the section on technology, specifically the ways in which telegraphy enable the entire world to know what had happened in faraway Krakatoa almost immediately after it happened. This disaster was the first instance of the ""global village,"" as Winchester explained.Winchester then examines the explosion itself along with the subsequent tsunamis, which caused the most casualties. Completing the story, Winchester concludes with the aftermath, both geologically but also socially, as Indonesia eventually wins independence in 1949 (and the effect that Islam had on that). Overall, this was a highly informative read and I give it three and a half stars. It would have been four if Winchester's writing had been more concise; I think fifty pages or so could have been cut out."

To say it is thorough (at least through publication date, as there have been subsequent eruptions on Krakatoa) is an understatement. Winchester covers every aspect of history that you can think of – Dutch colonial, botanical, maritime, indigenous, religious, artistic, political, literary, scientific – that relates in some way, shape or form leading up to, during, and after the eruption in 1883. It is all presented in a very organized and approachable manner. My own deficiencies sent me frequently to the internet to look up vocabulary; I also explored additional historic, cartographic and scientific contexts just because Winchester piqued my interest in learning more. The illustrations were helpful, and I appreciate that the footnotes, all elaborative, were placed at the bottom of the page."
59,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11745677-dollie,5,"I loved this book! I always enjoy reading about places I’ve never been and about historical events. This book had both of those subjects covered. This was such a comprehensive and complete tale of the events that happened between Sumatra and Java at 10:02 A.M. on August 27, 1883. Winchester gives you the whole story – why the Dutch were settled there, what the culture was like for both the Dutch and the natives. Everything that could be told about these two islands, including the wildlife of each island and the reasons why such wildlife were so different. I think I learned something from every single page. Winchester did an incredible amount of research, including visiting the site himself almost a hundred years after the island volcano exploded. I was blown away (no pun intended) by the ferocity of Krakatoa's eruption. The explosion was heard almost 3,000 miles away and the tsunami caused by the eruption killed almost forty thousand people. This was an incredible book for those of us who want to know everything about everything. I enjoyed it thoroughly. "

Since that wasn't what I was looking for when I picked up this book, I found it a bit tiresome and did quite a bit of skimming. We also learn about the history of trans oceanic telegraph cables which allowed the news of the eruption to spread more quickly than it had ever been possible in human history. About 40% into the book, the volcano finally erupted which is what I was looking for and that part was quite good. "

There was great information about the months before the final, catastrophic eruption, and interesting tales of what has transpired since. What I didn't care for were the many run-on sentences, the very early history of the area (that had nothing to do with the volcano), the seeming little-related political lessons of the colonization of the area. And at times, the science was a little much, even for me, and usually I don't mind science. The actual eruption actually took up very little of the book, and it felt like it was taking forever to get to it. "

The title and first chapter set the stage for the rest of the experience: a tease, followed a lot of tangential storytelling and rampant footnoting and by the time you reach the next chapter you forget what it was supposed to have been about anyway. Rich with detail, but to the point of being cumbersome. I appreciate that the author was quite taken with the subject and the minutiae, but it made for a dense and anticlimactic read. Would recommend with caveats."

Not only does the narrative saw back and forth across the timeline without warning or framing, but the author seems to be cropping data in ways that make no sense. Disregarding sutras and Indonesian records in favor of anything written by the Dutch doesn't make it seem like he's applying intellectual rigor, but rather a pernicious bias that he makes no effort to correct or even acknowledge. I'll keep looking for a book that actually uses all available sources."

I can honestly say that I will completely understand if folks hate me for picking this book, heck, *I* hated me for picking this book (most of the time). It's not to say I didn't like it, but the amount of information is sometimes hard to absorb. I slogged my way through the (long) chapter about plate tectonics and how volcanoes work, but came out on the other side to the big eruption (finally). Once the volcano started to blow, things became even more interesting. I certainly have a working knowledge of the history of the area that I didn't have before."

Much more than the simple story of a volcanic eruption, the book delves into tectonic plate theory, the importance of submarine cables to the reporting of the catastrophe (arguably it was the first major 'world' event covered by the international press), and the politics and daily life of the Dutch East Indies both before and after the mountain blew its top. Winchester further injects some sly humour into his footnotes. A fantastic read, but one in which you will have to pay close attention if you are not to become lost in the detail."

76,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21919680-dee-eisel,5,"I'm not going to beat about this bush: This wonderful book is getting five of five stars. Winchester did a fantastic amount of research and is a powerful, expressive writer. You should read this.That's the short version. The longer version:Winchester goes back to primary sources and maps and lays out the social, political, and geological background leading up to the explosion of Krakatau on Monday, August 27, 1883. He begins with a prelude mentioning his own visits to the area, then goes on to a first chapter detailing the early Western trade with the region. He discusses nutmeg and pepper, the Roman trade, and then the moving in of the Portuguese and the Dutch. In the next chapter he talks about the geography and further about the history of Batavia, the Dutch Javanese outpost.What does any of that have to do with a volcano, which only really comes up at the end of chapter 2? Winchester isn't content to simply recount the actual eruption. He's talking about the real human beings affected by the event, which means he wants to explain their politics, their economics, and their environment. Chapter 3 goes in-depth into the science of plate tectonics and why there are so many volcanoes in Indonesia, which is really critical to understand why the local Indonesian peoples reacted the way they did.In the fourth chapter we finally meet Krakatau itself, starting with its history of known or suspected eruptions prior to 1883. It is in the fifth chapter that finally we come to the events of 1883, and it is here that Winchester's chronology really shines. Beginning with February of 1883, he goes through primary documentation and describes events as the Indonesians and Dutch experienced them until August 12. Chapter 6 takes that some time period from the point of view of what the rest of the world knew. Winchester, like the mountain, is building up to the explosion. It's a beautifully constructed and laid out book, and as a writer I really admire the structure and his phrasing.Chapters 7 is short and entertaining, telling the story of what was happening with a circus visiting Batavia at the time. It is relevant, it's pretty funny, and it's the last breath of anything like normalcy that people would experience for months.8 follows with the actual eruption and its catastrophic effects. Here the tragedy comes into sharp and brutal focus, with none of the melodrama of the TV movies about the events but all of the shock that comes through in the documents. Winchester shows the tidal gauge in one place, tying it in to the horrible and incredibly deadly tsunami. He shows place by place what people experienced hour by hour, going into the fact that despite the fact the eruption was heard thousands of miles away, that the people local to it heard nothing. He even demonstrates how we learned much about meteorology from the event, detailing its effect on barometers, tidal gauges, and even art worldwide.In the ninth chapter, he deals with the political and social fallout of the eruption, and believe me there was plenty. I don't want to give any spoilers, so let's just say that the world as it is today can be traced in large part to the eruption. Don't skip this chapter.Finally, the last chapter deals with the rise of Anak Krakatau, the volcano as it is today. Once again, Winchester explains what is happening and why, and the current monitoring of this still-dangerous area of the Pacific. The epilogue returns to his visit to the island and how it looks today.I can't stress enough how well-written this book is. I am going to dive into more of his writing even if it's on topics I usually don't care about. It's that good. Don't miss it."
77,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18072990-shirlei,3,"So, I've read ""Krakatoa, the day the world exploded"" by Simon Winchester...Volcanos! They have been fascinating me for the last 32 years, since I was learning how to read and remember seeing pictures and drawings about Pompey and the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. I remember thinking that it ocurred 1900 years and a month before I was born and that to me was a GREAT coincidence (to children everything is a big coincidence!!)So, nothing more natural to me than reading a book about Krakatoa, a famous and deadly volcano. The reading is interesting because Mr. Winchester begins with telling us how a volcano is made and what it is made with. After this, he tells the story of the Dutch colonialism in the Indic Ocean. This part was, to me, very important, because I really didn't know anything about the region's history or about its geography. As for the part about geology, I was a little bit lost in the beginning and I had to do some research in order to full appreciate it.Although the days before and after the eruption are told with a lot of details, the eruption is described to us briefly. And it's nice to see how we live in just ONE planet, where the frozen of Thames River was probably caused by the eruption of Tambora in 1815, and that the eruption of Krakatoa made the planet became colder as well.The books is not so long, half the pages are notes, thanks, and bibliography. It took me a while because of the researches I did.If you interested in the world you live in, you should read it!I read it in English, and ebook, so I have nothing to say about the edition!"
78,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26460889-peter-tran,4,"Simon Winchester's Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded tells a story of the devastation caused by the eruption of a volcano known as Krakatoa, which erupted in 1883. The eruption is an event that cause mass destruction and political disarray which led to an anti-western movement in Java. The book is set in areas near Krakatoa, such as Jakarta and the Javanese islands, during the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century, when the islands were part of the Dutch Trade Company as a colony. The Dutch Trade Company colonized Java to monopolize on pepper, a spice that was worth more than gold in the west. The book notes the history of Java before and after the eruption, showing the tensions between the Javanese and the Dutch about colonization and religions.One the most memorable moments of the book in my opinion is when the author tells a brief history of spices and their values. I found it interesting how the value of spices where so great that it even caused battles. These battles include the Visigoths, who had invaded and laid siege on the Roman Empire just to get pepper. I just thought of the scene to be hilarious because in comparison between today and back then; getting pepper today is so much easier than back then.I didn't learn much from this book except for a great deal of history. Essentially this book is really just a condensed history textbook in my opinion. Like I said before it goes over the history of Java and there is a great deal of it. The book also goes upon other branches that relates to the Javanese and elaborates on them, such as the Dutch Trade Company and how they treated the Javanese and the outlook of the Javanese people as Muslims on a global scale.In short much Javanese history can be learned from. While reading the book, I had expressed two feelings for the majority of the book, and those feelings were fascination and boredom. Some parts fascinated me such as the section of spices as I mentioned earlier and the post effects of the eruption because it is very interesting to see the actions taken by the world and its politics. What bored me was some of the history which felt pretty dragged out and some of it I felt to be unrelated to the main idea.Ultimately, the history of the Javanese islands, stretching form the fifteenth century to the nineteenth, tells a story of the Dutch Trade Company who had the Javanese harvest spices for the Dutch, causing anger amongst the Javanese who then went rampant after the eruption Krakatoa, featuring a series of ""Islamic-inspired killings"" that was prepared by the Javanese due to their distrust of westerners. It all adds up to a tale of changes in the world after the eruption, which cause fear in many people all over the world.Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded is a fairly decent book and I really only recommend this book to those who likes history and non-fiction. Yes area are a it long and dragged out, but nonetheless it is still a good read. "

80,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,3,"Summary: Fascinating science, but dry and Eurocentric in tone.The book blurb and the subtitle of the book, which is the date of the explosion, both contributed to my expectation that this book would focus mostly on the explosion itself. Instead, there was a lot of history of European interactions with Java and a lot of information on plate tectonics. To give credit where credit is due, this was one of the best explanations I've read of the evidence for plate tectonics. It was clearly written and their were fantastically helpful figures. However, this is a topic I'd read about before. It was also somewhat less exciting than the actual explosion. Even the description of the explosion and the human impact felt dry to me though. When talking about science, the precise, dry prose felt appropriate. When talking about the explosion, I would have liked something a little more dramatic.Another, more significant problem with the tone of this book came up when the author addressed the Dutch occupation of Java. I was surprised from the beginning by how much the history we were given focused on the European spice trade. I'd have actually liked to learn about the history of Java. That was completely left out. We also get accounts of the disaster pretty exclusively from European observers. It's entirely possible that Javanese accounts aren't available, but not even mentioning the possibility felt like an oversight.All of the issues above already gave me the impression that this book was taking a Eurocentric approach to this event. That made it harder to believe the author when he described the native Javanese as 'content' with colonial rule. It made it hard to find him impartial when he used phrases like 'alleged imperial tyranny’ and ‘when the Muslims first turned aggressive’. Despite the fact that high taxation by a colonial power was a large part of what the Javanese were rebelling against, he uses terms like 'insurgents' rather than 'revolutionaries'. He also seemed to gloss over European violence while highlighting violent acts by the Javanese. It was not the most balanced coverage of this history.Despite the two problems above, I did learn a lot from reading this book. The earth science it covered, as well as the biological studies of the re-population after the explosion, were fascinating. I also enjoyed hearing about the author's own experience visiting Java. These parts of the book had a vibrancy the rest lacked. Overall though, this was a disappointment compared to the author's The Perfectionists, which I would recommend you check out instead.This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
81,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5447593-andrew-valen,4,"Prolific American writer Will Durant once said, “Civilization exists by geologic consent, subject to change without notice” (Winchester 299). These words epitomize Krakatoa, The Day the World Exploded August 27th, 1988. This book was a compelling and intense true story about a volcanic eruption on a tiny island in the Sunda Straight between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. Simon Winchester did a wonderful job of explaining a geographical disaster from the ground up. Initially, Winchester made a correlation to early mariners and geographers and their perception the world via voyages during the Asian Spice Trade. Then, he built up into the processes and reasons for explosions and earthquakes that could have led to a something like the Krakatoa explosion. He offered theories that were tested and in some cases warranted over the past 1,000 years. Touching on processes such as plate tectonics, subduction zones, remanent magnetism and transform faults just to name a few. All of which he carefully and in plain English explained how it affected the explosion that took over 36,000 lives and turned billions of tons of rock into vapor. Also, there were countless diagrams and illustrations to give the reader a visual experience of how everything took place. Finally, Winchester explained the days leading up to the explosion and the immediate and lasting impact it had on the world. Overall, Simon Winchester did an outstanding job of portraying this event and bringing to life the implications of what happened. It is not easy to take a geological disaster and discuss the science and history behind it while still appealing the audience and keeping their attention. Hearing the title, “the day the world exploded” catches the reader’s attention and is very real. What the reader may not know from the title is that it reflects many aspects. Yes, Krakatoa did explode and unfortunately kill thousands of people, but it also shocked the world and brought about many new things. “It took an event like Krakatoa’s eruption- which astonished an entire educated world- to underline the real revolution that this new technology was visiting upon the planet” (Winchester 182). Krakatoa may have been the first light shed on globalization due to its spreading of technology and connecting of a global community.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, geology, or in learning about plate tectonics and why this natural disaster took place and was more powerful than any other natural disaster in the history of the world. "
82,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3031302-kingshearte,3,"When I decided to re-read The Twenty-One Balloons, I thought it might be interesting to read a factual account of the volcano as a companion book, so I picked out this one. It was a very interesting read, with a somewhat broader scope than I'd anticipated.The first part dragged slightly, with details about both the history of Dutch colonialism in the East Indies and the area's geology. Aspects of the history were interesting, but not really what I came to this book for, and as for the geology, well, much of that was just a bit beyond my scientific knowledge and understanding, and it's hard to be thoroughly enthralled when you don't really know what's going on. But those parts were still quite good, and once the actual eruption nears, it got really fascinating. The further explanations of just what happened and why, and the incredible effects of the eruption were pretty darn cool. As with the Halifax explosion, it's a little mind-blowing to even try to imagine the incredible vastness of some of these devastating effects. The loudest (I think) explosion on record, the fifth deadliest tsunami (according to the one internet source I just consulted), and an air pressure wave that went around the world seven times are all basically unimaginable, but it's fascinating to try.This book also contains quite possibly one of the funniest parenthetical asides in a serious non-fiction book: The Times, then a less restrained newspaper than today, was only marginally more circumspect: ""The clouds gradually deepened to a bloody red hue, and a sanguinary flush was on the sea; the brilliant colours finally faded to a soft roseate [Peter Mark Roget's Thesaurus had been available since 1852:], then into pale pink, and finally died away upon the darkening horizon."" (288) I find that hilarious.Ultimately, I learned quite a bit from this book, both about history and about geology, as well as about the history of geology (I had no idea that continental drift and plate tectonics were only accepted as fact as recently as fifty-odd years ago), and enjoyed doing so. I may seek out more of Winchester's work."
83,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291846-david,4,"The book does much, much more than consider a single day.The island of Krakatoa lies between the Java and Sumatra in Indonesia. It is one of the most active volcanic areas of the world, and has erupted repeatedly for much of recorded history. The most cataclysmic of those occurred in 1883, when most of the island (and its 1800 meter peak) disappeared.The book begins with a somewhat drawn-out historic review of the area and a layman-friendly look at the evolution of theories of continental drift and plate tectonics that create the ""hot seam"" where Krakatoa is located. This investigation is enhanced by a look at evolutionary evidence for continental drift in plants and animals, and also a variety of geologic factors. Then we are given a look at the human residents of the area, both indigenous and external, and the kinds of things that were going on when the eruption occurred.The interest level increases as the author compiles descriptions of the eruption itself and the immediate aftermath. The explosion is said to be the loudest sound ever to occur on earth (based on the distance from the source where it was heard - 3000 miles!). The force of the explosion was measured in air waves that passed around the globe SEVEN times in the hours and days that followed. The resulting damage was catastrophic, both directly from the volcanic activity and from the tsunamis that followed.An interesting insight was that this event took place shortly after the completion of a series of transoceanic underwater telegraph cables, enabling people around the world to be aware of the events. It may have been the first news story of world-wide interest to take advantage of that new technology.One aspect of the aftermath of the volcano was physical - such as the changes to the entire planet based on volcanic ash in the atmosphere. There were also political implications, and the book describes the rise of militant Islam in Indonesia.All-in-all, this is a very wide-ranging book, but I enjoyed the variety of things I learned in the reading."
84,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1798704-robin,4,"I get a kick out of reviewers who read a 400+ page book by an Oxford scholar and criticize the author for following too many tangents and expounding too much. Has there ever been an academic who does not approach his subject this way? In 25 years of providing technical and clerical support to academics, I’ve never met one! It is true that there aren’t many books on Krakatoa to choose from, however the author does cite numerous sources for “Further Reading and Viewing,” if a reader would rather focus upon specific aspects of Krakatoa, its causes and effects, its underlying geology, its historical significance, etc. Indeed, this book is comprehensive, with lots of scientific and social background as well as extensive analysis of the eruption itself.I enjoyed Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded precisely because it was so detailed and complete. I especially enjoyed Winchester’s discussion of plate tectonics, his description of Dutch colonialism in Indonesia, and how Krakatoa fueled the rise of Muslimism in Java. And of course, the descriptions of the eruption itself—the written accounts of noise, smoke, and ash; the tsunami reports; the immediate aftermath—provide the climax for the story. Other fascinating topics include how the awe-inspiring post-eruption sunsets influenced artists, how the successful use of the telegraph made Krakatoa’s explosion the first social media event, and how the eruption changed and continues to change the geography of its island group. The epilogue, where Winchester visits the site of Krakatoa and climbs the Anak Krakatoa crater, provide a satisfying and thought-provoking ending to the story. Will Krakatoa explode again? Winchester makes a convincing case that the question is more WHEN than IF.Anyone with an interest in Krakatoa will enjoy at least parts of this book. Since it is too much information for many, I suggest skimming any sections that are difficult or too prolonged. For those with academic-ish minds, or interest in all aspects of the Krakatoa phenomenon, prepare for an engaging exploration."
85,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889855-grace-tjan,3,"The most interesting thing that I learn from this book is about how recent the science of plate tectonics is. Most of the major theories relating to it were only established in the 1960's. There is an astounding 100-year gap between it and the much more controversial theory of evolution. The history of the development of the theory of plate tectonics is fascinating, although some of the scientific/ technical details could be rather tedious to read for someone who is not of a scientific bent like me. Only two chapters are entirely devoted to the actual explosion and its aftermath, the rest being filled with various discussions about the development of plate tectonics theory, the colonial history of Indonesia, Alfred Russell Wallace and his contribution to the theory of evolution, the spread of 'radical' Islam, and even the author's reminiscence of his days as a geology student at Oxford. Some of these are supportive of the main topic, while others, like the bits about Wallace and Oxford, are interesting in their own rights, but perhaps only tangentially related to the main subject. The author seems to argue for a connection between the massive 1883 explosion and its catasthropic aftermath with the rise of anti-Dutch rebellions inspired by 'radical' Islam in Indonesia, a connection which I find to be tenuous at best. There is no doubt that the explosion caused massive hardship among the native population, but they had been suffering under the forced cultivation system instituted by the colonial regime for a half-century before that. Armed resistance against the Dutch, some of them inspired by Islam, had been occuring all over the archipelago long before the first rumblings of Krakatoa. "
86,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22923455-powder-river-rose,5,"My rating stands firm at 5 stars, it was amazing and I learned so much however there are quite a few who rated this 2-3 stars which I do understand; in part due to the fact that you don't arrive to the actual eruption until, on audio, about halfway in, being led on a series of related historical and scientific wanderings first. There are moments the story drags but Hold On!, it will turn that corner shedding yet another interesting new light. Simon Winchester's narration was very good and he kept a pace that moved along nicely. So there are many twists and turns before the actual explosion occurs. First of all there's the history of the area itself, it's discovery, colonial claims and the brief battles that took place. There's many a discussion of geology, the discovery of plate tectonics, weather changes, global changes. You'll find history on the telegraph, the Reuters News agency and Lloyds of London. An amazing amount of information is to be had and what Simon Winchester writes is mostly fact, part conjecture but that even feels right. There are tidbits as well as lengthy dialogue on a host of related subjects. When the devastation finally takes place it's in a series of events over a three month period. But that's not the end of it. You will hear detailed accounts from eye witnesses and then in the aftermath hear how, when the data was finally compiled, it became the basis for modern day science and technology in the related fields and what the still active volcano has been doing since 1883 up until the writing of this book. Again, t's amazing. There's lots in here and it can be heavy at times, but you will learn a great deal and, just as I feel I am, be the better for it. Give it a go...."
87,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,4,"I am slowly making my way through Simon Winchester’s books.Krakatoa, his book from 2003, is about the biggest recorded volcanic eruption in human history that annihilated both the volcano and the island bearing its name, and caused the highest and longest lasting recorded tsunamis, which killed about 35,000 people.Krakatoa, a volcanic island between Java and Sumatra began erupting in May 1883, and continued until August 27. On that day, the island exploded with a fantastic force of 100 megatons. The sound of the explosion was heard and recorded as far 3,000 miles away. The effects of such a powerful explosion were noticeable around the world with a global average temperature drop lasting for a few years following the explosion, and amazing sunsets caused by the dust in the atmosphere seen as far as Norway and England for three years afterwards.Besides an almost minute by minute chronicle of the eruption, the book is full of interesting geological info and detailed historical background. Winchester credits Krakatoa and the research that followed it with a big advancement in our understanding of meteorology and in particular the workings of the jet streams and gas and particle movements in the stratosphere.He also discusses the political and social aftermath of the eruption. He ventures an opinion that the Krakatoa eruption, seen by the local population as a punishment from the gods, together with the indolent and exploitive colonial Dutch rule have given rise to fundamentalist Islamic sentiments in the region."
88,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/234890-trina,3,"There's a lot of build-up that may be off-putting to some who just want to get to the pyrotechnics. We learn much about the spice trade and colonialization of the Dutch East Indies. We learn about plate tectonics. We learn Mr. Winchester's conflicted and perhaps problematic ideas about Islam (there being a statement of which I've lost track listing, among the devastating effects of the volcano, the rise of Islam among natives of the affected islands). The actual eruption takes up a remarkably small portion of the book. In addition, Winchester focuses on the science more than the human aspects of the eruption. He leaves out all the sordid details that sordid people like me are looking for in a book about Krakatoa. For instance: ""What was witnessed by the seamen on the Samoa, the Bothwell Castle, the Louden, the Berbice, the Charles Bal, the Kedirie, and a score of other ships that scoured the Sunda Strait during those weeks in late August, September, and October does not bear too much repeating, so awful is what they have to say."" It reminds me of that part in Grizzly Man where Werner Herzog keeps harping on how grisly (heh) the audio tapes of Timothy Treadwell's last moments are and how the ex-girlfriend must never, NEVER listen to them. I'm sorry, but it's just not cool to dangle horror in front of a reader/viewer and ultimately withhold it. "
89,0060838590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3661919-stephanie,4,"I had the great pleasure of seeing Simon Winchester lecture in (semi) person. Semi because although he was scheduled to appear at my university in the flesh in January, weather did not permit his flight from NY, so we had to make do with Skype. Which, when I think about it, is sort of fun since Krakatoa starts off with a long discourse about communication and globalization, even going so far as to deliver a short history of submerged telegraph cables. This book is essentially a little bit of everything - history, geology, meteorology, biology, geography, a bit of art and capitalism, politics of course; even theology is included. It's the sort of book to read when you're in the mood for nonfiction but you can't decide on a subject. In short, a fun ride of fairly elegant prose (made better in my case by the fact that I could imagine his voice narrating the whole thing).I don't have any real criticisms in this book, except perhaps that some of the tangential information felt a bit like padding. I tapped my foot impatiently waiting for for him to get on with the explosion already, but then again I've never had a particular taste for circuses. Perhaps you can do without a lot of what's written here, but for the purposes of playing Trivial Pursuit, it may be worth the effort ;)"
