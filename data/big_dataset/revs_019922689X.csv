0,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,2,"This is not a book to be lightly tossed aside, but one to be hurled with great force. I'm not sure who first came up with this quote, but I have never found it more fitting. It is a pity to say this, as there is much interesting material covered, but the knee-jerk relativisation with which every chapter is inevitably terminated outweighs any merit. The book attempts to do what it alleges, briefly covering Babylon, Ancient Greece, China and Islam, albeit missing India, the source of our numeracy and numeration. However, as it gets to the revolution in European science, the narrative becomes more and more saturated with the worst kind of cod pseudo-philosophy. Read this book unfamiliar with the material, therefore, and you will come away with a good general impression of the chronology of scientific evolution, but at the cost of a freight of unsupported value-judgements and distorted pop-science versions of the real advances.About a third of the way in I was already feeling irritated, but the crude naivety of the cultural relativism diminished, only to raise its head again at the end. Towards the end the author is committing such crashing solecisms as endorsing the view that genes cannot be ""selfish"", a characterisation whose limits Dawkins has been absolutely clear in explaining, and uncritically transmitting climate-denialist talking points about impending ice-ages and scientists having a financial interest in prognosticating disaster to acquire grant funds. (This last conspiracy-theoretical gem uncritically handed on from Roy Spencer, no less.) Superficially plausible when one is unfamiliar with the territory, the full weakness of this work grips one in its flabby tentacles when it trespasses on familiar ground.The author relativises ""Western"" science by defending the ""spiritual"" thrust of Islamic enquiry, and perhaps vice-versa, which is all very well, but Western science surpassed Islamic during the Enlightenment in ways that are objectively verifiable and utterly undeniable. A spiritual quest is all very pretty but it is not what we understand by science today. The abstract search for objective knowledge is not only superior in terms of results, it is also clearer conceptually. Clarity seems not to be an aim that the author endorses, however, as she conflates jargon with secrecy. Any technical field develops a jargon, of course - to communicate technical concepts clearly, you need the terms to fit them.Worst of all, the author is allegedly a philosopher of science yet she does not even seem to communicate Kuhn clearly. It is not mounting evidence that drives paradigm shifts but something far more nebulous - more of a general feeling that the old paradigm is not elegant. As Kuhn said, the epicycles of Ptolemaic cosmology were not measurably inferior to the predictions of the Copernican model. The results were to begin with about as good as each other, but the idea of epicycles was ugly. It is only in retrospect that we can see that heliocentrism is objectively more true - it predicts the positions of planets not merely as seen from Earth but as seen from a spaceship on the other side of Jupiter. In this sense, and many others, cultural relativism fails, and so do the author's value-judgements and appeals to motivation: Science gets results.This is not history. This is propaganda. "
1,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5836830-ian-robertson,5,"Patricia Fara has the hard academic chops - a degree in physics - and exactly the right contextual background - a PhD in History of Science - to attempt a book such as this, but as all scientists know, the right ingredients do not always provide the expected outcome. Fortunately for us, Fara is both well practiced and extremely capable, delivering a wonderful, insightful and non-traditional perspective on the history of science. Fara’s logical framework is not just a chronological retelling, but is grouped into seven sections containing logical themes: Origins, Interactions, Experiments, Institutions, Laws, Invisibles and Decisions. The book does unfold sequentially, but each section’s thematic underpinning helps readers link the seemingly unrelated events of a particular era. The thematic approach allows Fara to bring in important points or relations that are completely ignored elsewhere. For example, the slightly different German approach to experiments and their view of Naturalphilosophen is well explained and allows readers to reflect on our British-American centric views of science. Later, Fara takes dead aim at the common misconception of the scientific revolution, showing instead the inevitable intertwining of commerce, trade, culture and politics. Similarly, the chapter on Uncertainties (concluding the Invisibles section) was a delight to read, weaving together Freud, Einstein and “the 20th century’s most important philosopher of science”, Karl Popper.For those familiar with the subject, Fara’s storytelling is more akin to Bryson’s entertaining “A Short History of Nearly Everything” than it is to Stewart’s more analytical “Why Beauty is Truth: The History of Symmetry”, though she shares with the latter a very strong scientific imprint - a powerful combination. Enhanced by a crisp prose, interesting anecdotes, and a generous sampling of interesting illustrations, Fara combines the best mix of storytelling, scientific facts, and academic opinion. The accompanying illustrations - 59 of them - are interesting, illuminating, always germane, and well explained in the body. With respect to the groundbreaking scientific discoveries themselves, Fara provides explanation not just of the discoveries, but also: their historical context; as noted above their conceptual links to other, seemingly unrelated events and discoveries; and to their lasting impact on future scientific thought. For example, Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection (commonly referred to as his Theory of Evolution) receives the recognition it deserves, but it is featured not just as the groundbreaking science it was at the time, but also as a catalyst for more discovery as its truth was debated over the following decades. The role of women in science, and the treatment of women (and non-Nordic races) is firmly and repeatedly noted, as befits an author whose previous books include “Pandora’s Breeches: Women, Science and Power in the Enlightenment”. Interesting too are the many examples of research practices we would now consider unethical, and in particular where they took place (e.g. USA, Sweden), and who conducted them (e.g. Pasteur). Fara’s book is an excellent overview of the triumphs (and failures) of science over the past four millennia. She gives structure and context to what appear to be isolated islands of discovery - discoveries that have advanced our knowledge and made our lives easier, richer, or healthier - and in just over 350 pages she explores these far flung islands to map a storied archipelago. Well researched, well written, and hopefully well read."
2,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel,4,"An excellent read, but not exactly what I was expecting. This not an academic text charting the development of scientific discovery but rather more of an Arts and Humanities take on how human knowledge got to be where it is; a lot of exposition is built around various pieces of art and explaining their context and meaning (lending it an Art History feel to the whole thing, which was an interesting take on things).The book is split into themed chapters, starting with Origins (which contains an excellent section on how contemprory views of early scientific history have squeezed centuries of disparate, progressive thinking into neat little strata), and ending with Decisions, speculating on the morals and ethics of modern science, and future we face as a species thirsty for knowledge and power. It outlines the path of science as controlled first by religion and now politics. In its infancy, science and religion were easy bedfellows, and for all intents and purposes one and the same thing; science was used to prop up religious accounts of the nature of world. As the discoveries of Copernicus, Newton, Darwin and the like challenged religious orthodoxy, science, as we know it, began to diverge from natural theology and has now become a tool of governments and political doctrines.What I most enjoyed was Fara’s attempts to redress the balance in terms of the typically chauvinist history presented of the singular, usually Western, scientific hero who periodically changed the way we thought about the world overnight. There is a keen emphasis on the collaborative and cumulative nature of all scientific endeavor, and that self-marketing and ambition are usually the drivers that mean we now associate particular discoveries with one man. There is also a passionate defence of the largely forgotten role of women in the history of science, which I found refreshing. It was interesting to read of how arbitrary the path of development now seems in hindsight; Fara frequently stresses how the contemporary culture, and later economy, shaped and defined what was science and what wasn't, what was interesting and what wasn’t. Whilst kudos is also due for highlighting the largely downplayed role of Arab and Asian (i.e. ‘non-Western’) cultures in science, I found that in trying to be so even handed the book sometimes steered uncomfortably close to a strange moral relativismVery enjoyable and informative read, with a curious and heady blend of hard science, history and art. I did find the closing chapters discussion the future of science rather weak – I know we look in to the future by studying our past and all that, but perhaps the prognostication should have been left to others. This book is not just one for science buffs, but written with a clarity that makes it a good read for even those with just a passing interest in man’s greatest enterprise. "
3,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107056155-halil-kalkan,5,"I have just finished this book and it was an amazing experience for me. It is obvious that long working hours have spent to writing this book. There are tons of knowledge, historical events and popular names in 7 chapters. But in my opinion the most impressive main idea about on this book is that the author is included non-popular names into historical scientific events. As I mentioned above the book is divided 7 different chapters and all chapters start with a quote which is selected by Patricia Fara. (Origins, Interactions,Experiments, Institutions, Laws, Invisibles, Decisions)In all chapter the author reminds us that the science is a kind of cumulative progress and the most famous scientists were not ""a revolutionary heroes"" or ""lone genius"" as we thought. She does not forget to honor that the non-popular heroes behind the dozens of scientific events. Astrological observations in Babylon is really well explained with the facts. With this scope the author brings a harsh criticism of Euro-centrism on the basis of solid evidence in Islamic golden era or China's history.She is cleverly shaping to whole stories with the chronologically from beginning to until ending chapter. With the author's template you can notice simply that the science evolved with socially and politically factors. Addition to these she also tries to explain how women have been blocked by men from the history of science for hundreds of years... I'd like to point out that, unfortunately, she usually wears ""a Britain glass"" in this global story so for this reason whole story is leading us by British ideas. It creates lack of idea diversity, especially, to making interpretation about on industrial revolutionary.Nevertheless, this book can be defined as ""a masterpiece"" or ""science history 101"" that tries to look at from a wide angle perspective about on astrology, geology, cosmology, modern physics, Darwinism, environment with political sense. We're talking about on, easier said than done, 4000 years...Finally, she has shared her valuable sources in the last pages of book therefore it's a big opportunity to get deeper information about of all this scientific topics!"
4,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251555-shinynickel,0,"Off: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content...Fara has not one birthplace for science, but three. The book is almost unique among popular surveys of the history of science in devoting substantial attention to the Chinese natural philosophical heritage. Almost as ancient as the Babylonian tradition, this is certainly the oldest continuous one, and Fara draws from recent scholarship to flesh out an interesting picture. But this attention peters out fairly early, as the book shifts to the more canonical origin for science.That would be Europe. For all the attention that Fara devotes to debunking heroic narratives supposedly perpetrated by most historians of science—Isaac Newton draws her particular ire—from Babylon and China she goes on to replicate much of the standard narrative: first Greece, next a light touch on Rome (mostly Galen), the Christian West through to the early modern era, and then a slower pace from the 18th century to the present (with a heavy, some might say excessive, attention to developments in Britain). We only glimpse China once or twice more and never really see Latin America or Africa except from shipboard. (On the other hand, her account of science and medieval Islam is spot on.)"
5,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592864-kevin,1,"Science: A Four Thousand Year History is an unconventional take on the history of science. Unlike conventional histories, Patricia Fara, tries to debunk scientists and their achievements rather than celebrating them as heroic genusis in pursuit of reality. She Frequently emphasizes where notable figures were wrong or misguided and how their discoveries often involved luck or methods no longer accepted as scientific, often sitting in judgment of what contemporary prejudices colored scientific findings and ideas. Fara never discounts their ideas wholesale, but comes close on several occasions, especially if they come into conflict with our modern social norms and the feminist movement. She stresses how science is fallible and subject to personal, political, and material pressures. In an effort to destroy the picturesque ideal of mostly European lone scientific genius making great discoveries isolated in their laboratories Fara traces the origins of science to several sources now thought of as magical or unscientific, such as concepts and techniques rooted in astrology and alchemy. Artisans and technicians, not just canonical philosophers and ""scientists,"" have always been important contributors, she points out. She reminds us, too, that amateur observers and collectors have long played significant roles. These observations and many others along the same lines are not particularly controversial or surprising. Fara tries too hard at times to bolster the importance of minor figures, especially women, doing fairly mundane things that were important to scientific discoveries to the point that it feels like she would rather fore sack what the discoveries have given us as a society to build up minor role players to make up for a slight of history.It is very substantive, thought-provoking, and briskly-paced. In support of the main themes Fara has interesting things to say about science and religion, non-Western contributions (with noticeable omissions; Rome, per-Colombian Americas, India), the contributions of women, the roles of scientific institutions, and many other important related subjects. "
6,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26640274-n-w-martin,3,"What a fascinating book, though a bit recycled. From what I know about the history of science and technology, this book was a broad survey reiterating what many other history of science historians have claimed. Nonetheless, she adds spice to it by writing it in narrative format while leaving room to analyze her evidence and give you an in-depth picture of what is going on. For instance, her chapter on the Early Modern period was fascinating. Fara's piece on Descartes disappointed me because he was much more than what she claimed, but, overall, the way she intertwined the relationship of Agrippan Magic with the search for knowledge, all culminating into what we call the birth of science today (or Newtonian Mechanics) was outstanding. Another thing I really enjoyed was he intentional implications that literature is as far removed from science as well think. It was implied andn ot really argued, but you could see in almost every chapter. In short, She really knows he stuff!"
7,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/977414-dr-carl-ludwig-dorsch,2,"  Not at all a history of four thousand years of science, but a general (and largely anecdotal) critique of such histories. Very well written and amusing but not exceptionally illuminating, though I can imagine it a provocative discovery for a naïve history-of-science consumer.  "
8,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63946505-b-j-marshall,1,"The author has such a huge bias against the ""lone genius"" theory of history (which is seriously flawed and exaggerated in nearly all instances) that she can't even mention a famous scientist without adding ""and a gifted self-promoter"". It's not as if the only quality of a good scientist is self promotion. Obviously the Crick/Watson versus Rosalind Franklin issue is a famous one, and Franklin deserves much more credit than she got initially. I think in the current retellings people go out of their way to point that one out. Sometimes though it isn't the person who discovers the crucial piece of evidence but the person who synthesizes all the available information and gets to the right idea first that matters. And sometimes it's not the first person to have an idea (Copernicus and heliocentrism) but the one that said it convincingly enough for anyone to listen. Science and technology is about progress, and stating an idea that doesn't cause people to move on from that point isn't contributing in a meaningful way to that progress. Even if you are more right or earlier than someone else.The main thesis that the history of science and technology is far more complicated than the stories we're told in junior high (I guess middle school now) is definitely true. You lose people, however, if you insist on the complete story with all the contributions and backstories on everyone and everything all the time. I think most serious students of the history of ANYTHING understand that. I suppose it's good to be reminded of that, but the repetitive bludgeoning here is a bit much. And the indictment of the entire idea that some people really have contributed more to science than others, that some ideas really were key to accelerating progress and moving things forward.The last chapter is largely a tirade about how technology is destroying the planet - again there is definitely some truth to this but it is itself a simplification of the real story. Ironic given the previous 300 pages of repeated rantings about the oversimplification of narrative. Then there's one paragraph that says that some people think technology is evil without understanding the higher standard of living that comes with it. Balanced ""reporting"" - and almost a self-reference or admission of guilt.In summary, too complainy, too dedicated to the alternate hypothesis, and too anti-technology. Good to hear other opinions as antidotes to simplistic views and unabashed support of technology, but a bit over the top. She also got a couple simple facts wrong in her antinuclear complaints about Chernobyl and nuclear weapons. Not that I'm biased again antinuclear people - which I am - but I have more respect for the ones that can at least explain the physics correctly."
9,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,4,"Quite an unorthodox take on science and its history, starting from the title. The author gives strong emphasis on socio-economic contexts and political decisions as source and determining factors in the deployment of science as we know it today. Besides providing spicy demistifications, the book remarks that our current conception of science is peculiar and not necessary; and while we are nowadays supposed to look at it as the grand final destination of a millennial quest, we should instead remind that in many occasions in the past other cultures or civilizations purposely chose not to go ahead in such eminently materialistic and reductionist direction for some precise and grounded reasons, and not because they missed the opportunity or were intellectually or morally inferior. Readers looking for a linear sequence of events according to the canon will be both surprised and challenged, as the book is more interestingly organized in small chapters that try to capture stages that are rather self-contained and for this very reason partly overlapping in time, hence the opportunity and sometime the necessity of non-linear ordering with anticipations and backtrackings. The focus is only marginally on technicalities and in-depth descriptions of discoveries or ideas, but rather an the encompassing dynamics and adaptation of the very concept of knowledge acquisition and on its dovetailing with societal issues, religious beliefs, technical breakthroughs, commercial opportunities and geographical exploration - as best represented by the multifaceted discussion of evolutionism."
10,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20109672-del-herman,4,"Pretty cool history of science by Patricia Fara, whose main intention going in was to smash simplistic narratives in the account (particularly that of Western paternalism over the sciences). I would say she does a pretty good job of doing that, giving us a nuanced history of science that shows us the development of the profession from its infancy in the astrological observations in Babylon to the emergence of sociobiology, environmentalism, string theory, and other trends in scientific discussion in the present day. Kudos to Fara for calling attention to the situation of women in the sciences too!"
11,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11080051-amanda,5,"This book is rather sobering and does an excellent job of being fair. It was refreshing to not have science glorified or condemned all the time. It has made me rethink the science media I consume and has piqued my interest in topics I wish the author had covered more: science in ancient Babylon, China, and the Islamic world. As someone not well versed in science beyond the basic college core this book was not beyond comprehension nor patronizingly simple in tone. Perfect balance for an introduction to the history of science."
12,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,3,"I guess I'm not as interested in the history of science as I thought I was, because I only made it to 1700AD or thereabouts. Probably not much of scientific interest happened in the last 300 years, so if you read this book I think you can safely skip the last three centuries."
13,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65262770-tim,4,Great book up to about 1950’s when the author starts to judge what the scientists did with atomic work and other projects. 
14,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77841071-ruward,5,"This is great! Up-to-date, sticking out necks, and short!"
15,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934784-shirin,3,"Let us get this straight. This book was not designed to provide comprehensive account of all the topics. As far as introductory to ideas and subjects, this book did a great job. After all 4,000 years history is not something that can be exhaustively crammed into 428 pages.Each topic is presented in short 6 to 8 pages long, some a little more. Dr Fara did a great job on being concise and if the reader wishes to pursue a specific topic, Dr Fara provided the references in pages 431 to 459.I find the sheer breath of the topic eye watering. I guess this is one of those life work publications that I keep hearing professors mentioning in PHD classes...a publication to be pursued AFTER one completes their PHD. And this is exactly that.The idea that scientist being a relatively new term is not new. Science becomes known as it is now after the bifurcation of scientia sacra into two branches; what i call the materialistic scientific topics (spear headed by names like Descartes) and topics dealt by the church. But to actually start thinking that science have been in practice all the way back to the the Babylonians... that needs stewing a bit more, as 'science has always been connected to people like Newton, Einstein and the likes. Aristotle, Socrates and their cohorts has always been connected to philosophy not science....but they did dabble in 'scientific' activities, though now it would probably be categorized as theoretical rather than experimental.Coming from the east I appreciated Dr Fara's attempt to draw attention to the contribution of those from the east; china, Islamic civilization, etc. But lets face it; who reads these types of books anyway. So while the effort is appreciated, I doubt it will change perceptions much.I can imagine the effort put into this book; the mountains of paperwork, following up on a whole bunch of different topics, filing them, tagging the information. Because I understand, I will not be too hard on Dr Fara's identifying Malaysia in reference to the origin of a certain collector who wrote to Charles Darwin sometime in the 1800s, on page 279. The formation of Malaysia is a fairly recent event and i would refer to the various kingdoms on the malay peninsula back then as Sultanates -or the strait settlements. Even the name Malaya came much later, i reckon before 1946 when Malayan Union was formed. There was also another boo boo; again in reference to the malay states elsewhere in the book. So editing work needs to be tightened up a bit. If I can identify these I am sure there would be a few more. But who cares, these are not life changing.Final thing to point out is Dr Fara's focus on atheist scientists and Richard Dawkins. I think where ever Richard Dawkins work gets air time, his should be balanced out with some references to Rupert Sheldrake's work; just a thought.All around a nice introduction to the various ideas. Thank You Dr Fara for putting it all in one place for people who otherwise would not even think about it.I took a while to finish this book, so the condition of the book went from pristine to acceptable."
16,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,1,"People who hate scientists shouldn't write histories of science.According to the cover, some reviewer writing in The Economist described this as ``provocative''; I would have gone with ``belligerent'' myself.It's not a history of science so much as it is a series of vicious personal attacks against European and American scientists. Fara spends most of the book railing against an imaginary scientism and ``obdurate Eurocentrists'', trying to make the point that, no, you can't call anyone before the 20th century a scientist, and modern science is just one incredibly arrogant and racist and sexist way of knowing that happened to become popular, and anyway the Chinese and Muslims did it first.She represents scientists and European proto-scientists as arrogant thieves, perverts, shameless self-promoters, and ossified old codgers whose lust for fame, power, and money stifled true innovation if it ever happened in the West at all. They never accomplished anything on their own, but just pilfered their knowledge from Muslims, the Chinese, and Native Americans, and the occasional (often female) brave entrepreneur who was forever oppressed and derided by ivory tower elitists. It's a smörgåsbord of naïve exotism, condescending cultural relativism, and frothing-at-the-mouth lunacy.To give an example of the type of thinking this book is packed with: she grudgingly acknowledges that French hospitals after the Revolution revolutionised medicine by providing a systematic way of studying patients and classifying their illnesses based on careful observation, but can't help but complain about how this ``reduced patients to a set of symptoms'', robbing them of the precious ``face-to-face time'' and raport that was apparently more common when people still believed every illness could be blamed on imbalanced humours. Sure, these people were now dramatically more likely to survive their encounter with their physician, but is that really the point of healthcare? Shouldn't we lament the fact that fact-based medicine has driven so many quacks out of business instead?This is just one tiny example; the whole book is full of this sort of bullshit. She attacks Darwin, the inoffensive bore, as a virulent racist who probably beat Irish children for sport (not literally, but heavily implied), and Einstein as a media-hungry egomaniac simply because he rarely wore socks (the attention whore). Acknowledging that any male Western scientist has done any good at all seems to cause her genuine physical pain.I don't know why she should hate scientists as much as she does. Apparently she dropped out of Physics to pursue her career as a Mary Midgley clone, so maybe it's just an issue of insecurity. The depth of the scientific illiteracy (and, for that matter, innumeracy) she displays is certainly something fantastic; maybe she just really doesn't understand what science is.Either way, Midgley herself used up all of my patience for nastily ignorant windbags like this. I have no idea why the OUP would print this garbage, but it's not even fit to be used as toilet paper."
17,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050909-tonstant-weader,4,"Patricia Mara’s Science: A Four Thousand Year History is the most enjoyable science history I have ever read and I have read a few. It is enlivened by her strong opinions that make it clear that more than one of our science heroes were unpleasant people to know. She points out how often a false scientific theory reaches preeminence because of good marketing, good luck or good connections, though in the end, science’s self-correcting ethos of trying to prove everything wrong works in the long run.Science: A Four Thousand Year History is organized in seven units of seven chapters–a prime number product of prime numbers. Her first chapters is called Sevens and talks about the special properties of seven. It has many scientific, religious, mathematical and cultural points of significance. This brings Mara to one of the central themes of the book, what gets to be science and what is left out. It’s all about classification, isn’t it? The Arts & Sciences? What is art, what is science and who decides? Why is astronomy science and astrology hoodoo?The answers change over time and one thing she wants readers to understand is that today’s answers may one day sound as wrong headed as yesterday’s alchemists. For a time, Lysenkoism seemed as sensible as Mendelism, until millions starved to death as a result of his dominance of Soviet science. And Mendel never even knew the significance of his discoveries.Mara takes time to point out the contributions of women to science, and how hard it often was for them to make those contributions in a world where they were considered lesser. Well, where they are still considered lesser. She also brings a perceptive class analysis to how science developed and why some scientists were less successful despite their great achievements while men with lesser accomplishment carried the day for a time.You can read the rest of the review here: https://tonstantweaderreviews.wordpre..."
18,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201179-daniel-wright,4,"If there's one subject I wish people knew more about, it's history of science. And no-one needs to learn about it more than scientists (not to mention philosophers of science - don't get me started). When you read even a broad, sweeping introduction like this one, it's jaw-dropping just to realise how ignorant you are.The picture that emerges, in this carefully crafted introduction to all the historical study of the natural world as far back as civilisation is known to have existed, is, for those who prefer the Popperite logical positivist approach to philosophy, is pretty bleak. It turns out that the scientists - to use the term very loosely - were often self-serving, close-minded and arrogant. Well, who knew?But if - as Dr Fara does - you embrace a Kuhnian view of things, and accept the fact that science is done by human beings, and human beings are quite messy, but realise that a coherent body of knowledge can emerge nevertheless. In fact, it works rather nicely. Fara sometimes - and quite rightly, in my opinion - goes out of her way to debunk a number of myths in the history of science, and sometimes doesn't even bother to do that, but simply kicks them out of her way with a raised eyebrow and a sardonic smile.The author deserves the plaudits she has earned for this work, including an award by the British Society for the History of Science. No-one should attempt to venture opinions about Scientia as a concept without familiarising themselves with the bare bones of this story. As I've already indicated, it is perhaps the biggest hole in the knowledge of the 'intelligent layman' crowd that there is."
19,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198165-kathy,4,"I think David would really enjoy this book. It is especially interesting to read either before or after reading Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol. The author, Patricia Fara, has a very readable style of writing. There are short vignette-types of reading sections. She seems very knowledgeable in her field. I was impressed by her bio. She brings out fascinating connections and many new-to-me stories about mathematicians and scientists from history. This book provides amazing background knowledge from which you will re-define the word ""science"" in your mind. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the book got weaker during the final 100 pages and also, I don't believe the book will be very relevant in 10 years as so much will have changed. It is a good book to read in 2009, the year it was written. "
20,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2686359-cf,4,"This excellent, comprehensive history of science starts with Babylon and moves straight through to the present day, covering everything including Newton, Einstein, Darwin and many, many other big names in science. Science's very interesting origins are all covered, from the little-known Eastern starts, and the fact that the Muslim world, initially, were strong leaders in Science and growth. Reaching through to Greek philosphers and the beginnings of mathematics. This book is great for a little bite sized snippet on each topic surrounding science, not every single topic, or scientist, even, is covered. But it definitely gives you a taste, and leaves you wanting more. Fara's short, concise, to the point way of writing is informative and entertaining. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is gaining an interest in science! "
21,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4155416-sanjiv,4,Science has become the new religion and evidently has more fire power and revolutionary potential than the institutionalised and the humanist religions. In fact one could see a certain amount of zeal amongst the humanists and the theists to interpret scientific data as per their preconceived notions. Now this book suggests that the scientists too are not as objective as they would like us to believe. They interpret their data using the same principles as any dogmatic believer would. The geniuses of science have been lucky and at times devious too. Nothing new in this view and Kuhn had pointed out the same long time back however Dr. Patricia Fara has written a fine book and has put forward her thesis cogently. She has also highlighted the prevalence of male chauvinism in the scientific community.

There are some vitriolic reviews about this book on Amazon, personally directed against the author, that accuse her of imperfections and generalizations - but obviously, anytime you're writing an overview book (4,000 years of history), you're going to have to take the view from 100,0000 feet up. And that's a different view than the view at 40,000 feet, and a different view from the view at 5 feet. To be accused of missing detail at 100,000 feet seems like a moot point. I admire the scope of this book, and the excellence of it. Good job! And to the author, if you ever read these reviews, don't let those jealous academic colleagues (which I assume they are) get you down. "
23,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12741026-sam,5,"An excellent choice for people who are either developing an interest in science or have always loved science as so many important names, dates and details are placed into a very subjective historical context rather than just be relayed as bald statements of fact. Never have I seen science presented in such a well-rounded way as normally the political opinions and religious beliefs of the day are not to the fore in science books, but it can be seen just how relevant they are in terms of how discoveries have been presented in the past. I very much enjoyed the author's lack of neutrality as it added some very enjoyable colour to what may have been black and white and bland. It is a very heavy read, both literally and physically. Very highly recommended."
24,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28441-chris-callaway,4,"Scholarly but very accessible to the lay reader, and revisionist in the best sense of the term. Fara is wonderful not only at telling the story of the development of science, but also telling the story about HOW that story has been previously told. The stereotypical view of science and scientists has been developed in part for rhetorical and polemical reasons, and Fara explains how this has happened but without dismissing of minimizing the value of the scientific enterprise itself (or its achievements). It would have been nice to have some discussion of social science, but perhaps that is for another book."
25,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12490903-tiredstars,2,"Somehow I found this book less than the sum of its parts. Individually the short chapters are readable enough and have some interesting facts and ideas in. But put together, I'm not sure... Maybe I felt the same sort of points were being made over and over? Perhaps the denial of a cohesive history for science, along with the wide scope of the book, made it feel scattered; a series of vignettes or short lessons rather than a coherent history or argument.So despite getting at least 3/4 of the way through the book, in the end I didn't have the will to finish it off."
26,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7040900-fraser,2,"I really had high hopes for this book. It seemed to me that it couldn't fail to be an interesting read that I would learn so much from.I guess I did learn from it but the writing style was dull I am afraid and uninspiring.I waited for a spark somewhere, but none came.Readable, but disappointing overall."
27,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13144944-gramakri,4,"Though the readers looking for something more technical will be disappointed, overall this book is quite a light and entertaining read on the sociological history of science for a layman.More details and keypoints of the book @ http://bookwormsrecos.blogspot.in/201..."
28,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22200980-rory,4,Very well written. Fara puts many of the great advances in science in their historical contexts that illustrates well how different individual and societal pressures have shaped scientific debates over the centuries. Strongly recommended for anyone with an interest in science.
29,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2246406-anibal,0,"In Patricia Fara words: ""... science has changed the Universe and its inhabitants forever"""

31,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751946-andrez,0,I know I own this. I just don't know where it is. Hmm.
32,019922689X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33472761-andre,3,"Good book, unfortunately, this edition/translation has many problems, such as missing figures and misspelled words."
