0,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"As people who read books on evolutionary theory will know, mice sometimes exhibit bizarre behavior, fearlessly walking into the waiting jaws of cats. They do this because they have been infected by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which can only reproduce in a cat's digestive tract; the mouse's behavior is thus adaptive, not for the mouse, but rather for the parasite. Dennett uses this as his starting point when discussing the nature of religion. Maybe religions are like T. gondii: they are self-reproducing patterns of human behavior (""memes""), which take over their hosts and make them carry out acts whose main purpose is to further spread the meme. To Dennett, the religious martyr is like a mouse whose brain has been modified by T. gondii.If you are yourself religious, the above may leave you feeling angry and disappointed with the author. This is perhaps not the best reaction, since Dennett (I think, anyway) is genuinely trying to understand the nature of religion without judging it. To him, the meme theory is the only one that makes scientific sense, and throughout the book he stresses that it in no way implies that religion-memes would necessarily harm their hosts. As he says, our bodies contain trillions of non-human cells, many of which are essential to our survival. Religions may be deadly parasites like T. gondii; but they could equally well be as vital to human well-being as our intestinal flora, without which we would be unable to digest our food. And although a Christian will probably be unhappy to hear Christianity called a mind-virus, she may be more willing to stick that label on Scientology or one of the Pacific cargo cults. As long as it isn't a religion you feel any personal affinity with, it does rather seem to make sense; once you're prepared to agree with that, you may reluctantly admit that the distaste and anger you feel when the reasoning is applied to your own religion could just be the meme defending itself. Evidently, an adaptation which discouraged believers from even considering arguments against their religion would be fitness-increasing.Dennett's basic thesis seems perfectly reasonable to me as a starting point for further investigation, but I was disappointed that the greater part of the book was extremely speculative; as evolutionary theorists like to say, it mostly consisted of ""just-so stories"". Yes, religious ceremonies may have evolved because they improved fidelity of meme-copying, and religions may initially have increased the fitness of the populations that practiced them by helping people make difficult decisions or making them more receptive to medicinal hypnosis; but it seemed to me that these ideas created almost as many difficulties as they resolved, and were not well-supported by empirical data. On the other hand, Dennett is a philosopher, not a scientist, and his business is more to ask questions than to answer them. If he's managed to get people thinking about these issues, maybe he's done all that can be reasonably expected of him.I could end here, but there is one point I kept thinking about that I just have to mention. Dennett discusses religion from a scientific point of view, and cannot avoid the obvious question: maybe science is just another religion? He claims that it isn't, since science is based on empirical analysis of data while religion is not, but I was not entirely satisfied with his response. A scientist's attachment to any particular theory may not be religious; but what about the scientific world-view itself? Why, exactly, should we use facts and rational debate to resolve disagreements? I've just been reading through the Dialogues of Plato, which (at least in my view) constitute one of the important founding documents for the modern scientific outlook. Socrates, a highly sympathetic character, takes nothing for granted and questions everything. He duly dies for his beliefs, and it is hard not to think of him as a kind of martyr to rationality. Why, exactly, is he different in kind from other religious martyrs, except that he is supporting the belief system that I personally happen to like? Aaaargh, Dennett's somehow got me playing his game... I think I've been infected by the religion-as-meme meme! Didn't he say something about welcoming a response? These philosophers are so damn tricky...___________________________________It's hard to stop thinking about this book. If Dennett is on the right track, I wondered what other memes there might be that propagated in ways similar to those for religions; to me, the ones that seem to fit best are language, music and poetry. They're all things that spread well and demand extremely faithful copying: as Dennett says, pretty much a sine qua non for a successful meme. But how are these different patterns related? How did the meme-copying adaptation arise, and what memes was it originally being used to transmit? Is it possible that all of these memes started off as the same thing, and only split apart later?It would be nice to come up with some way to find empirical data...___________________________________People curious about T. gondii may find this article interesting."
1,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134616-marina-keenan,5,"To preface my remarks here, I think it is important that I note Dennett's definition of religion and its implications. He defines religion as social systems whose participants avow belief in a supernatural agent or agents whose approval is to be sought. Two elements of the definition almost cause me panic as I read them. The first, the fact that any religion is a social system, suggests to me that since one cannot worship a supernatural agent alone, God, a ""he"" most everywhere you look, is really the collective concept of a group of people who are similarly connected socially and religiously. In a recent Good Reads forum based on Dawkins' The God Delusion, most of the faithful who participated suggested that because so many others believed in God throughout history, their study of ""scripture"" should not be questioned by me or other participants. Alas, none were willing to address the reasons why their church hung pictures of a Jesus who looked more like a white musician from Seattle than someone from Jesus' home town. This scares me because the faithful have confirmed that their minds are not their own and they have lost the ability to think critically about their beliefs. The other part of the definition that almost leads me to panic, that the participants seek approval from a supernatural agent or agents, means that not only is some vaguely defined and socially reinforced God concept granted greater-than-self status in the minds of the faithful, but the agents' ""prophets,"" to whom enough has been revealed to write a bestseller, are granted God's special favor, and their approval must be sought as well. This scenario is made possible by the aforementioned sacrifice of mind, and enables leaders of any religion you'd care to name to compromise its believers in practically any way.In Breaking the Spell, Dennett demonstrates faith in people's ability to make clear decisions by suggesting that if school children were to study all of the world's religions, they would learn to think critically and be unwilling to sacrifice this ability for the sake of any supernatural agent or prophet. Should students begin to have thoughts that transcend social/religious paradigms and pressures, no current religious system could survive it, and I think that would be a good thing."
2,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"Because of the rather cumbersome first part, clearly addressed to an American public, I almost gave up reading this book. Fortunately, I did not, because in the second part Dennett gives an overview of some interesting theories on the origin of religions. It is not surprising that he prefers evolutionary biology ones, which always focus on the question of the evolutionary utility (cui bono?) of a certain development. That's the big difference with Richard Dawkin's The God Delusion: Dawkin's focus is on the truth question, Dennett's on whether religion is good for man or not.I did miss the directness of Dawkins in this book, and the speculative nature of the many theories and hypotheses Dennett unleashes on the reader surprised me. But certainly the second part convinced me that Dennett is definitely the more intelligent thinker of the two. I especially found the distinction he makes between ""believing in a God"" and ""believing in believing in a God"" an eye-opener that should be developed further. But you can clearly see Dennett hopping on 2 legs in this book: he has an eye for the good sides of religion, but at the same time he regularly hints at what nonsense religions sell and how much evil they do, and that it comes down to 'breaking the spell'. Certainly in his last chapters you see the pendulum swinging back and forth in his text, and that gives the book a rather tousled undertone (although his stance as a combative atheist is very clear).Ultimately, I especially remember this book's strong plea to subject religions to scientific research. And I think that is a good thing: everything must and may undergo the careful screening by science. I can absolutely follow Dennett in his outline of how cautious science should be in this, step by step and with a lot of empathy, critical and also open to self-criticism. “I would like nothing better than for this book to provoke a challenge — a reasoned and evidence-rich scientific challenge — from researchers with opposing viewpoints”. But at the same time, Dennett is a child of his time, with a rock-solid belief in the ultimate truth through science. Unfortunately, in my opinion, such scientism will never succeed in bringing out what’s really valuable in life.(rating 2.5 stars)"
3,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"An admirable intellectual, Dennett spends the first several chapters carefully establishing the parameters of his discussion. His book addresses the adherents of organized religion: more specifically, those who believe that God is a ""who"" rather than a ""what"", and who hold certain sets of beliefs without making them available for rational critique. The title of Dennett's book, ""Breaking the Spell,"" refers his insistence that religious beliefs should be examined logically and scientifically to investigate whether they are true. Beliefs should not be eligible for a cloak of mystery simply because they are religious in nature; furthermore, such a cloak does not enhance the real value of these beliefs.This is a slow read that requires a good background in philosophy, but it is worth the time and effort. It is full of fascinating ideas, many of them old philosophical standbys with a modern scientific twist. For example, when Dennett compares love for God with romantic love, he looks at the evolutionary basis of romantic feelings and behaviors. He asks how religion benefits our fitness for survival, given that it requires so much of our energy. He notes that some neurologists have postulated a ""god center"" in the brain, and he clarifies that we may have culturally perpetuated the idea of God only because the idea happens to stimulate the pre-existing ""whatsis center,"" and furthermore, that not every individual may even have such a center.Dennett's tone is one of cheerful optimism. He thinks religious people often mean well, and he believes that they succeed in living good, moral lives just as often as non-believers do. But he insists that religion is not necessary for moral behavior, and he demands that religious people desist from harming atheists and skeptics. He wants a healthy climate for honest debate and a world where people do not injure each other over such topics. It is a fair and diplomatic book that makes an apparently sound argument. Of the various books I've read by atheists, this is the one of which I'd be most surprised to see a successful refutation."
4,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,2,"This was my fourth attempt at reading Breaking the Spell. Back when I first got interested in nonbelief, it was one of four books I purchased physical copies of at the bookstore, along with The God Delusion, God is Not Great, and The End of Faith. In fact, it was the first of those four books I decided to read, because I was struggling with my own dwindling faith, and the title seemed the least confrontational so I figured it would be the best to ease myself into things. I quickly got tired of the book and abandoned it. In fact, I abandoned the whole effort, and it wasn't until a few years later that I resumed my journey by reading The End of Faith, which I really enjoyed and then plowed through the other two books.I felt guilty that I had skipped over this book, the only one of the ""Four Horsemen"" books I hadn't read. I wondered if I had perhaps been unfair, and disliked it only because of where I was, and not what the book was. So I picked up the same paperback copy I had purchased years earlier, and again tried to read it. Again, I quickly found myself losing interest, and it was never a book that I ""stopped reading"", it was just one that I never reached for when I felt like reading.The third time was shortly after I'd gotten an ebook reader. I figured, with a huge library of books at my fingertips, I'd be more likely to read this one, so I tried once again. I got the ebook version of Breaking the Spell, and for the third time found myself losing interest. I had officially moved this book to my 'will-never-read' shelf on Goodreads, and had resigned myself to simply never bother reading this book. I was bummed about it, and I couldn't quite figure out why I disliked it so much, but there are so many great books out there, I decided I couldn't bother caring any more.Then, out of nowhere, I was logging into Audible.com one day and noticed that Breaking the Spell had been released on audiobook format. Audiobook! This was the key! I could listen at the gym, on the bus, in the car, and walking around downtown. This was how I was going to get this book read, I thought.Well, I'm happy to say, I did actually manage to get all the way through Breaking the Spell this time. I am, however, unhappy to say I still hated it, and largely forced myself to complete it out of a weird sense of obligation and completion. Less because I enjoyed the book, and more because I knew this was my last chance.After getting all the way through it, I finally figured out what it was I hated so much about it, and sharing that will be the entirety of my review of it, aside from the personal historical lesson above.I've read a lot of these ""atheist screed"" type books in the past few years. What is interesting is that the background of the authors of each of these books is directly reflected in the content and style of the book itself. Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned scientist and professor, so it's no surprise that ""The God Delusion"" is written very scientifically, citing as many studies as possible and outlying arguments in a clear, logical way. Sam Harris is a neuroscientist, but also has a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy, so The End of Faith is a little less scientific than Dawkins's work, and a bit more meandering. Carl Sagan was a scientist and educator, so The Demon-Haunted World is extremely scientific, but also very approachable and friendly. Christopher Hitchens was a debator, a journalist, so God is Not Great draws upon a lot of current events and political angles, and reads like a very long OpEd piece.So what's Daniel Dennett? He's a philosopher. If this fact doesn't give you pause, you probably haven't read a lot written by philosophers, or you are one. Philosophers have a tendency to ramble forever, carefully mapping out their argument in excruciating detail. There's a point in the argument where a normal reader might say ""alright, I get it"" only to discover they are approximately 40% through the entire argument, and must now eye-roll their way through the remaining 60%. Philosopher's seem to like questions more than answers, and like to pose tons and tons of questions, and consider every possible angle about a particular point, including purely hypothetical ones with little to no basis in reality. The short way of saying this is: a lot of philosophers love the sound of their own voices. This is obviously a mean generalization, but I have to admit I've found it to hold true surprisingly often.Dennett's Breaking the Spell is no exception to this. It is exactly what one might expect from a philosopher, illustrating every negative aspect of stereotypical philosopher writings. Case in point: the first third of the book is spent merely justifying the existence of the rest of the book. What would be a normal author's introductory chapter is, instead, nearly 100 pages of droning about the need for his book. Can science study religion? SHOULD science study religion? Ugh.In fact, the TITLE of the book, ""Breaking the Spell"" seems to indicate that the book will be about what we can do to break society free of the cycle of religiosity. The only chapter that even remotely deals with that, ""Now What Do We Do?"" is the final chapter, a mere 32 pages of the book's 340 (non-appendix) pages. Another (mild) irritation is Dennett's constant citations of his own previous work. I understand if an author wants to point readers to his previous work because it might be interesting, or help articulate a point, but it seems almost comically frequent in Breaking the Spell. There's a palpable sense of pretentiousness.I don't want to give the wrong impression. It's not that the book contains nothing of value. On the contrary, there are some really enjoyable bits to the book, some really interesting points, and a lot of food for thought. The problem is that of padding: an interesting point that should take up a merel paragraph to be accurately conveyed to a reader might instead consist of a few dozen pages instead. Every moment reading the book feels like wading through haystack after haystack looking for needles. They are nice needles, but you can't help but ask why Dennett couldn't be bothered to simply edit the haystacks out.There are lots of similar books that are more informative, or more interesting out there, so it's tough to recommend this book. I know a lot of people love it, so I think a big part of the issue is my own general distaste for this particular kind of writing. "
5,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"I am a huge fan of Dennett's other work, but not really this one. He spends most of the book talking about why it's worthwhile for scientists to debunk religion and for religious folks to put their faith through a scientific test (which is fine), but he spends much less time actually debunking religion through science. I don't mean debunking a ""God created the world"" theory, which other books have done, but the idea that religion is good for people and good for society. He seems to take for granted that it is not and yet most cultures have created religion over time and again and again. It must have served some function that is not deleterious. He seemed unwilling to probe that. I would suggest Robert Wright's work as a better explication of evolution and religion (it's not a defense of religion at all--but more of an evolutionary view of religion)."
6,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1228813-paul-fidalgo,5,"I can't recommend this highly enough. This is not an anti-religion screed at all, but comes at the topic of religion as a naturally emerging aspect of humanity in a thoughtful, funny, accessible way. It is ""New Atheist"" only in that it calls for open questioning and research of religion and its utility (and it's written by an atheist). "
7,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/578156-jamey,4,"If I understood it, the basic thesis of Dennett's arrogantly titled Consciousness Explained was that consciousness is a phenomenon that emerges from the harmonious orchestration of many smaller, dumber subsystems in the brain. Among the good ideas in Breaking the Spell is the claim that one of these little modules is an ""agent detector,"" and that it's ""over-active,"" so that people experience the wind as the breath of a God; the rain as the God's gift, disease as the presence of exorcisable unclean spirits, and so on. If you do believe in a God or Gods, this is a strong enough book to make it worth your while outmaneouvering it; if you don't, this is a strong enough book to take on as an ally. It has little or none of the hysteria you find in Dawkins and Hitchens."
8,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157126-jennifer,2,"Dennett doesn't offer us much that is new in this book; it's basically a re-presentation of old ideas (we're just robots taking up the intentional stance, religion is a meme to be explained in Darwinian terms, etc), thrown together with a good deal of liberal social commentary, a painfully distorted presentation of Catholic, Jewish, and Islamic belief and practice, and some revisionist history for good measure. It could easily have been two hundred pages shorter if he had cut out all the irrelevant anecdotes. I also found it very strange that Dennett proposes, as if it is something new and intellectually heroic, that we study religion as a ""natural phenomenon"". Last time I checked, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, and critical theorists have been doing that for well over a century and a half. Of course, Dennett supposes that if we open up religion to the neurologists and biologists, the game is surely over, and we will all become secular humanists in light of the ""results"". I, for one, am quite confident that if religion has survived these purportedly devastating queries so far, a gaggle of neurologists telling us which neurons flash when someone prays is unlikely to make us throw it all away either. "
9,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/659395-paul,2,"I really wanted to like this book, because I'd just finished reading The End of Faith and God is Not Great, but this book suffers from lack of conviction. Where The End of Faith is the absolute model of conviction, and God is Not Great lays out convincing arguments (but takes some of their momentum away with dryly humorous asides), Breaking the Spell has neither conviction nor cleverness.I confess I only read the first couple of chapters, because I lost interest in an author who wasn't willing to commit to a point of view. He's basically saying yes, religion is a dangerous, polarizing influence on human behavior but hey: you can believe whatever you wanna believe - can't we all get along? The reason I loved The End of Faith so much is because Sam Harris chose a convincing point of view and supported it with compelling - even poetic - arguments. Chris Hitchens seems like he'd be fun to get a drink with, and Daniel Dennet seems like he couldn't even decide what drink to order."
10,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"Mr. Dennett is one of the Four Horsemen of Atheism, and a personal hero of mine. In this book, he discusses the need for science to study religion. He points to ""an absence of information"" about religion. We need to find out why people believe in the supernatural and what the results of those beliefs are. I agree. He presents his case in an easy to read book meant to reach out to a large audience. Philosophers of religion get very little attention in the world of philosophy. He points out how the scientific study of music has just begun to figure out why we love it. We need the same kind of study for religion. ""If you were God, would you have invented laughter?""--Christopher Frye in The Lady's Not for Burning. What a great question. I think I would have invented it just to deal with this incredible mess that a supposedly perfect being created. Dealing with a corpse plays a central role in religions everywhere. Something must be done with it. Therefore, we create an elaborate ceremony of either burning or burial. ""Ancestor worship must be an appealing idea to those who are about to become ancestors.""--Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works. So we old folks preserve these traditions that help us to deal with the end of our lives. Evolution has designed us to love babies as being cute. It's important to our survival. All mammals have that within them. But it works the opposite way as well. Babies are hardwired to trust their parents. Those parents pass on memes like religion to the trusting children. There is a profusion of ways that ancient people delegated important decisions to uncontrollable externalities. Instead of flipping a coin, you could flip arrows (belomancy) or rods (rhabdomancy) or bones or cards (sortilege), and instead of looking at tea leaves (tasseography), you can examine the livers of sacrificed animals (hepatoscopy) or other entrails (haruspicy) or melted wax poured into water (ceroscopy), Then there is moleosophy (divination by blemishes), myomancy (divination by rodent behavior), nephomancy (divination by clouds), and of course the old favorites, numerology and astrology, among others. Divination memes may just make people feel like they are receiving divine assistance. It makes them feel good. Thus they go on. ""Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist should have his head examined.""--Samuel Goldwyn. People went to shamans because they had no one else to go to. It provided them with some sense of relief. Folk religion turned into organized religion just the same way folk music turned into professional music. ""Among the Nuer it is particularly auspicious to sacrifice a bull, but since bulls are particularly valuable, a cucumber will do just fine most of the time.""--E. Thomas Lawson. Anthropologists find people deeply believe in their gods. ""Everyone knows they exist!"" ""Those to whom his word was revealed were always alone in some remote place, like Moses. There wasn't anyone around when Mohammed got the word, either. Mormon Joseph Smith and Christian Scientist, Mary Baker Eddy, had exclusive audiences with God. We have to trust them as reporters--and you know how reporters are. They'll do anything for a story.""--Andy Rooney, in his book Sincerely, Andy Rooney. In the film Marjoe, Marjoe Gotner explains how he got people to faint, make passionate displays of love for Jesus, and empty their wallets. The film won an oscar for best documentary in 1972. Some of the many Christian sources were later excluded and banned as heresy. Why? What made them so dangerous? ""Religions exist primarily for people to achieve together what they cannot achieve alone.""--David Sloane Wilson, Darwin's Cathedral. ""But what are the benefits? Why do people want religion at all? They want it because religion is the only plausible source of certain rewards of which there is a general and inexhaustible demand.""--Rodney Stark, Acts of Faith. ""The Pope traditionally prays for peace every Easter and the fact that it has never had any effect whatsoever in preventing or ending a war never deters him. What goes through the Pope's mind about being rejected all the time? Does God have it in for him?""--Andy Rooney, Sincerely, Andy Rooney. ""When I was a child, I used to pray to God for a bicycle. But then I realized that God doesn't work in that way--so I stole a bike and prayed for forgiveness!""--Emo Phillips. A key marketing problem for religions is to entice the customer to wait. The physicist Paul Davies has recently defended the view that free will may be ""a fiction worth maintaining."" Many people know about the change from polytheism to monotheism. Fewer understand the change from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts. ""You're basically killing each other to see whose got the better imaginary friend.""--Rich JeniTheists resist having a specific definition of God. It makes the concept easier to refute. ""God is so great that the greatness precludes existence.""--Raimundo Panikkar, The Silence of God.""It is the final proof of God's omnipotence that he need not exist in order to save us.""--Peter De Vries.""There are people who believe, often passionately, in God, even though they cannot tell others all that much about the God in which they believe.""--Alan Wolfe""It is very easy not to murder people. Very easy. It is a little bit harder not to steal because one is tempted occasionally. So that is not great proof that I believe in God. But, if he tells me not to have a cup of coffee with milk in it with my mincemeat and peas at lunchtime, that is a test.""--""It isn't just that I don't believe in God and naturally, hope there is no God! I don't want there to be a God; I don't want the universe to be like that.""--Thomas Nagel, The Last Word.Our salvation may depend on evolutionary theory. If we continue to ignore its lessons, we endanger the earth and ourselves. Only evolution gets hit with the ""just a theory"" bullshit. Nothing else in science gets that treatment. The proposition that God exists is not even a theory. ""It was the schoolboy who said, 'Faith is believing what you know ain't so.'""--Mark Twain. Children are subject to religious practices that would send any other practitioner to jail. Why do we say a kid is a ""Catholic child"" or a ""Muslim child"" or any other. Let's do more religious education, not less. Let them see the truths. Instead of trying to destroy the madrassahs that corrupt young Muslim minds, why don't we provide more alternatives? We do, and they get attacked. There is a secretive Christian organization that believes in the End Times scenarios. It includes such famous politicians, mostly Republican, as Grassley, Dominici, Inhofe, Nelson, Ensign, Stupak, and De Mint. ""The religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide.""--Ralph Waldo Emerson."
11,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919652-jed,4,"I considered for the first time that teaching a child religion might be a form of child abuse. I learned that there might be bio-evolutionary reasons why religions develop and that when we come to see that religion is invented, we need to remember to be gentle with others who might not have seen that. Nonetheless, we owe it to ourselves to consider the costs of religion. It might be that it harms our world more than helps it. If religions were based in fact, we would have to accept that. Since they cannot be proven to be based in fact, we don't have to accept the harm they do.I now call myself a ""bright"", that is, someone who accepts that the material world has no creator, no supernatural power. Despite having completed more than a year of studies toward the ministry, I feel relieved by this new awareness. I am a secular humanist. If the world is going to be improved, I now believe it will be because we did the necessary work to make it better. There is no deux ex machina. No god will come save the day.The book is full of quotations from other authors. Two I particularly liked are:""It was the schoolboy who said, 'Faith is believing what you know ain't so.'"" - Mark Twain""Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things -- that takes religion."" - Steven Weinberg, 1999Be forewarned: it's not an easy read. At the end of each chapter, Dennet provides a summary of the chapter you've just read and an overview of what's to come in the next chapter."
12,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Dennett is among the nicest scholars I've encountered. He is just eminently reasonable, kind-hearted, and eloquent throughout. The argument he makes in ""Breaking the Spell"" is almost tamely reasonable: ""my central policy recommendation is that we gently, firmly educate the people of the world, so that they can make truly informed choices about their lives."" OK, of course, no arguments there, from nearly any quarter. The bulk of the book is occupied with a much different argument, perhaps an example of this broader philosophy. Dennett wants scientists to embark upon a massive project to understand religions - their origins, their impacts (good and bad), their psychology, sociology, economics, etc - in short, everything about them that can be addressed scientifically. He makes the argument for two reasons: science on religion has been hampered by a sort of veil of politeness, in which it might be considered offensive to take the often overly forward tools of science to something so dear to so many people; and because religion will play such a large role in large-scale future societal issues that we can't afford to not understand it. These arguments are straightforward and compelling and it's hard to imagine anyone even half-way reasonable objecting to them.Dennett, I'd like to think correctly, goes on to assume that the reservations of his audience have melted away in the face of his overwhelmingly reasonableness. He spend the bulk of the book fleshing out a popularly-oriented review of theories on the evolution and social impacts of religion, making liberal use of the meme concept he finds so useful. While it is primarily a summary of prior research and an identification of the key open questions in the debate, Dennett doesn't hesitate to flesh the picture out with a starting hypothesis: the one he considers the most persuasive. This is interesting, but not the sort of thing I'd normally go out of my way to read. Yet it was a true joy to read, for many reasons. Dennett is just a really clear thinker, a wonderful writer who has many nice turns of phrase (half the pages I dog-eared are just for some clever way of articulating a thought I've had or might use). His thoughts on science - what it is, why it is, and how it can be used in social and cultural contexts, are particularly clear and exciting. "
13,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769655-mike,2,"It was certainly interesting, and its chief thesis is worth contemplating. I think that were it less philosophical (i.e. speculative b.s.) and more empirical, I would have found it more persuasive--or at least a more enjoyable read. I sound like my students now in saying that I think it could have been written with the same (or greater) effectiveness in about a third of the pages, but in this case it's true. He elaborates in a way that seems more self-indulgent than illuminating. I don't know, I didn't read the book in the best way. I set it down for too long, and rather than starting over (as I should have) I picked up where I left off, and that discontinuity diminished my impression of the book, I think. One thing that IS interesting, though, is he differs greatly from the othr New Atheists in his lack of confidence that religious propositions can be tested, though he's all about testing scientifically-framed religious questions. But whereas most of the other New Atheists seem to think that religion is at least understandable and therefore subject to falsification, Dennett's view, rather, is that most religious propositions mean almost literally nothing. That they are pronouncements very much in the vein of a non-latin speaker reciting a verse of Latin. Just sounds. Comforting sounds. And he argues, more, that most people don't believe in God, but they believe in belief in God. Hmm.....perhaps, though hard to tell (which is his point, actually). "

He is able to singlehandedly defeat many Christian conventions that have become acceptable to our modern American society through the use of pure, philosophic logic that works well to break us all out of the spell in which we have been living all of our lives as members of a ""Christian Nation"" (to quote Sam Harris). He use of example and parable makes the book invaluable to anyone who wants a new way of loking at the convention of religion in general, as long as you get through it without becoming offended (which I did, because I believe his thought processes to be both sound and beautiful)."

20,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,2,"In this book, Daniel Dennett pleads for intensifying scientific research into religion as a natural phenomenon. We have waited too long to do this and nowadays we see ourselves confronted with issues of which we lack the essential insights to make informed decisions. For example, in combating islamic terrorism, we are awfully short on scientific facts to base our policies on. This book is in essence a two-sided project. First and foremost Dennett wants to break the spell of religion. Religions have shrouded themselves in mysticism/obscurantism and have immunized themselves of critique. Believers all over the world claim to be offended by critical probing into their convictions and the effects of those convictions on society as a whole. This is what Dennett sees as the spell that has to be broken. Another spell that has to be broken is the timeless (and tiresome) linkage between belief and goodness (this is the origin of religious hatred against atheism) and the association between spiritualism and morality (only spirituality - of which religion is perceived to be only one form - can offer you a good and meaningful life). The 'belief in belief' and the 'belief in spiritualism' are claimed to be moral and good, but in reality both of those beliefs are selfish and childish. It's time to break this spell as well!The second goal of Breaking the Spell (2005) is to synthesize the different strands of scientific theories on religion and to offer a preliminary model of religion, to be investigated further - via the scientific method.In part 1 of the book Dennett explains why the spell needs to be broken (21st century problems), how science can offer help in making informed policies and decisions regarding religion and how our investigations should proceed. Basically, we should ask ourselves Cui Bono? - who benefits? Dennett shows (convincingly) that religion doesn't have to offer benefits to its believers, it can either be a parasitic, symbiont or neutral complex of memes. In part 2, Dennett gives an oversight of the current science of religion and synthesizes this into an explanation how it is that religion is a universal cultural trait. Human beings use the 'intentional stance' to attribute agency to other humans and all sorts of natural objects that move. We seem to have 'hyperactive agent detection devices' - the continued mental triggering of alarms signalling agents wherever we look. Some of these imaginary agents can be used as decision aids (divination), others can be used as shaman's tools (health maintenance). Because these mental constructs are memes, they have been subjected to - conscious as well as unconscious - revision and design, i.e. thus ultimatly based on memetic fitness). Rituals, music and storytelling - in our eyes extravagant religious displays - were tools to transmit information (we are talking about times before the invention of writing). Shamanic traditions were possibly helpful interventions, playing on our natural dispositions. For example, there's evidence that the presence of hope in a sick person triggers fierce immunological responses, thereby increasing the chances of recovery (we are talking about times before the invention of pills or surgery).The next step in Dennett's explanation of religion is that people became stewards of the (religious) ideas that entered them, domesticating these ideas and thereby bringing a new dimension to the Cui Bono? question. Some of the features that emerged from this religious design are secrecy, deception and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation (thereby giving these stewards powers they wouldn't otherwise be able to wield). This stage in the evolution of religion is tightly connected to the adaption of agricultural practices ca. 10.000 year ago; due to specialization and bigger communities there was room for castes of priests to originate (for the first time in human history).The last stage in the evolution of religion is the interplay between religious memes and our human need for group forming: because of language and culture, religion could serve as a marker for in-group friendliness and out-group hostility. Because of trade networks and the dispersion of knowledge, a marketplace for religious ideas originated. Different designed systems competing for adherents with different needs and tastes. This is why rationalistic economic theories, in combination with memetics, are our best shots at explaining the existence of so many different creeds. The result of this evolution of religion is that we ended up with a 'belief in belief'. Even though most people might not be religious anymore (in any way that makes sense), the consensus is still that belief is associated with morality and goodness. This makes it hard for atheists to combat religion, because 'belief in belief' ensures immunity to religious creeds, even though the defendants in question might not even be religious themselves. We have to break the spell that belief is necessary, or indeed sufficient, for an intellectually fulfilled and meaningful life.In part 3, Dennett offers his comments on some loose ends. We should chart the pros and cons of religion in an honest attempt to develop a (metaphorical) Buyer's Guide to Religions. He argues that the academic smokescreen, upholded by postmodern, neo-Marxist social scientists, has to be annihilated first. After this, there are two questions to ask: (1) Is religion beneficial to people? There's no evidence in favour for this. There are some health benefits, but other studies show that prayer for patients created higher levels of stress, leading to lower recovery rates. (If there would be evidence to the claim that religion offers health benefits, we would know them by now, since religious organizations would be the first to bring the news). (2) Is religion the foundation of morality? This simply can be answered with 'no'. Descriptively speaking, morality has biological and cultural roots, and prescriptively speaking, religion has no claim to the moral high ground. If morals are just prudence (I do as god tells me, because I will get a heavenly reward), then religion is dangerous. If morals are good in and of itself, then religion is simply not necessary; at best it hinders our efforts to get to universal human moral (and rights).In the final chapter, Dennett asks us to use his model and predictions as a stepping stone to scientific knowledge on religion as a natural phenomenon, in order to create well-guided policies to combat the religious delusions that endanger the entire world in the 21st century. One of Dennett's building blocks is education on all (!) religions, thereby creating an environment in which children can make informed decisions as adults. Another building block is to get the religious moderates to speak out against the fanatics in their midst, and destroying the barrier that they have built around their ideas: only constantly critizing ideas can combat extremism - religious moderates stand in the way, always claiming they're offended.I re-read this book, after reading it some years ago. I can remember I found it a dull book, but on my second reading it offered me some gems of insight. Maybe I just wasn't open-minded enough back then. In any case, this is a decent book (not one his best) that conveys a very important message. I found that most if his predictions and claims have withstood the test of time and that some of them seem even more urgent now as back in 2005 when this book was published."
21,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Not likely to break the spell!Professor Dennett is a philosopher and an expert on consciousness who writes from the perspective of a Darwinian. He is an atheist and calls himself a ""bright,"" an unfortunate coinage from the redoubtable Michael Shermer of Skeptic magazine. I say unfortunate because those who do not identify themselves similarly might feel that they should be thought of as--shall we say--less than bright. Such self-designating and flattering terminology, however agreeable to those using it, only serves to isolate them from others--but perhaps that is the point.Putting that aside, I also need to put aside another of Dennett's mostly irrelevant preoccupations in this otherwise carefully considered and nearly exhaustive examination of religion, namely that of the power of memes. Coined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976), a meme is, on the one hand, a fancy word for ""idea"" and the results of ideas, and on the other hand, a kind of cultural gene or virus that replicates itself through the activities of living things, especially humans. Here's the way Dennett expresses it: ""The idea of memes promises...to unify under a single perspective such diverse cultural phenomena as deliberate, foresighted scientific and cultural inventions (memetic engineering), such authorless productions as folklore, and even such unwittingly redesigned phenomena as languages and social customs themselves."" (p. 355)In other words, Dennett believes the term ""meme"" can be extremely useful by helping us to understand cultural evolution. And, yes, religion can be seen as a meme. However I think his purpose in this book would have been better served if he had narrowed his focus and concentrated exclusively on religion as a natural phenomenon.And it is that, and Dennett makes a convincing case for scientists to respect something so natural to humans. What he doesn't do is make the case for an end to religion. What he wants is for those in our various religions to have the courage to openly examine their beliefs, tenets and practices and the effect they have on society as a whole. The question, is religion a good or a bad thing? is asked throughout the book, both explicitly and implicitly; however for the life of me I am not sure what Dennett's answer was!--although I can guess. At any rate, its clear that he believes if such an examination were conducted there would be fewer true believers in the world and less pain and suffering.But religion is not going to go away because religion and humans are as intermixed as the yoke and white of a scrambled egg. For most people a religion is like a thought in your mind. You cannot long be without one. Dennett doesn't care for this idea, I suspect, since he declares that his beliefs do not constitute a religion. A ""religion"" is a way of life. Tracing the derivation in Webster's International Dictionary (the venerable and highly respected Second Edition) one has to wade through several hundred words before arriving at ""8b Acceptance and devotion to such an ideal as a standard for one's own life."" For the most part Dennett is using earlier, more exclusive definitions. Of course some people do not have a religion since they live willy-nilly, from one impulse to the next without much foresight or appreciation for past events. But such people are in the minority; indeed they are, in a sense, children.Dennett calls the reader's attention to the evils and dangers of religion at length while at the same time giving religion its due as a sometime force for good in this world. But much of the good that religion does is seen by Dennett as the result of something like a placebo effect, and would benefit humankind regardless of the ""truth"" of the religion. He acknowledges studies that show that ""regular churchgoers live longer, are less likely to have heart attacks, and so forth...,"" but adds that many of us ""haven't stopped to consider how independent [these results]...are from whether or not any religious beliefs are true."" (p. 272) Yes, it would be better--and such a day may come--when our religious beliefs are more in line with reality than they are today, taken as most of them are from the primitive science and psychology of long ago.Religion also has utility, Dennett allows, because it strengthens people psychologically in some circumstances by giving them resolution and confidence, regardless of the fact that their confidence is based on nothing real. (p. 178) Sometimes any plan or belief--even one that is clearly wrong--is better than no plan or belief. Religion may also help people by creating or strengthening ""bonds of trust that permit groups of individuals to act together much more effectively."" (p. 178)Dennett does not add at this point, but very well might have, that the cohesiveness of the tribe under the spell of a charismatic leader of the endemic religion strengthens the tribe in warfare. Indeed my contention is that this is the major reason that those of us living today have a built-in propensity to believe without evidence, because those that didn't died out because they were defeated by tribes that got their warriors to die for the cause in the name of their God. Dennett doesn't explore this path--although he does mention it--probably because he finds ""group selection"" troublesome.I wish I had the space to go into more of the many interesting points that Dennett makes or to quibble with some of his conclusions. The book is fascinating and--even though Dennett, as usual, is intent on leaving nothing out--it is readable and lively, more so than some of his other books. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

Religion must be viewed as a choice life made to carry for some kind of advantage it provided for survival. From these elementary beginnings Dennet follows the evolution of religion, of faith and of spirituality through the ages. Throughout Dennett challenges the reader to examine what is belief and what is belief in belief.I found this book exhilarating. It is very well written and only occasionally did I find myself having to reread a page or two to keep up with him. But that's my problem.

Dawkins""What these people have realized is one of the best secrets of life: Let your self go. If you can approach the world's complexities, both it's glories and it's horrors, with an attitude of humble curiosity, acknowledging that however deeply you have seen, you have only just scratched the surface, you will find worlds within worlds, beauties you could not heretofore imagine, and your own mundane preoccupations will shrink to proper size, not all that important in the greater scheme of things.

He is not polarizing like, say Dawkins, but that also gives him the ability to reach a broader audience. That, unfortunately, may be where he lost some steam with me in this book. I felt like his detailing his argument parameters left me often saying, ""I know, let's get to it."" Therein lies the problem I had with this book, I wasn't the target audience. The book really seemed to be geared to those who have not really examined their position on faith and belief or are just starting to. I did so long ago so this book only added nuggets of supporting information for my convictions. As a philosopher, he is stunningly detailed in his mapping an argument and his approach is very even handed. This makes him accessible to those who are intellectual and also wanting to take an honest look at the arguments on faith, etc. Dennett doesn't demonize or mock peoples beliefs but rather just lays the arguments out for reasonable discussion. However, Dennett is so thorough he comes off as a bit meandering and boring if you already know where he's going. But, if you are new to the arguments or material then you will probably enjoy this hard work.I didn't like the idea of grouping ""freethinkers"" as ""brights"" for two reasons: 1. It simply seems a little corny; 2. It implicitly suggests those who believe are ""dims."" Again, where ND Tyson and Dennett shine (as did Sagan so perfectly) is their non-offensive approach which allows people to process the information without tuning out due to perceived insult. This is the role of the educator. In the end, I think I prefer listening to Dennett in a lecture setting more than his writing as the time constraints force him to be quicker to the point. But again, for those who enjoy philosophy or simply want a robust, yet unoffensive, argument on faith and belief this book will likely serve them well."
25,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10718146-adam,4,"Pros: Dennett's clear and light-hearted (self-effacing even) style of writing has the ability to bring readers from all walks of life into his theories and examples. He weaves evolutionary theory into several disciplines, and isn't as pedantic as some philosophers writing in the same area(s). In Breaking the Spell, he approaches religion from his standard naturalist worldview and posits the question ""Cui bono?"" (who benefits?) throughout the work as he attempts to explain the origin and survival of religion in terms of natural selection. Also, he scratches the surface of the doxastic systems required to be religious (paraphrasing 'Believers have to BELIEVE they can believe in the facets of their faith.') which leads to an interesting discussion regarding propositional attitudes towards religious belief. Cons: Dennett sometimes ruins his charade of neutrality by getting on his atheist stump and preaching (to the choir - for who else will read his work?) which detracts from the arguments and hypotheses he presents. Also, some explanations - while relevant and usually fun - run a little long. The worst offense is the strength (if any) of his arguments is diminished by his lack of conviction to really hammer his solid points home. I suspect he doesn't want to sound dogmatic, or even worse, be quoted and pigeonholed forever by his claims. But then again, his claims are so vague now that he could be erring so far on the side of caution that his work will fail to make a significant impact.Overall: I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the study of religion. I would not recommend this book to professional philosophers (and I think Dennett intended it to be this way)."

And Breaking the Spell is much more than a polemic. I can't begin to say how much I learned from this book, about the coevolution of human society and the world surrounding it. Dennett expands on the idea of memes and the evolution of ideas, including religion.There are so many interesting subjects here: divination as a means of reducing responsibility for decision-making; dealing with the death of loved ones; the reproductive advantage of memes that involve fantastic elements, like a floating axe or a talking donkey. The list goes on. Most interestingly, he points out that not all things that coevolve are mutually beneficial, and the various good and bad points to the world's evolved religions are explored as well.

29,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"In Breaking the Spell Dan Dennett, Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University, examines religion as a natural phenomenon. In other words, he examines the evolutionary, sociological and psychological factors that served to make religion ubiquitous among Homo sapiens.Dennett has been dubbed one of the “Four Horsemen” along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Sam Harris which is bizarre because he comes off as about the nicest, most cordial and courteous person around (he even looks like Santa Claus for goodness sake). The only people who could take offense to the book are those with chips on their shoulders who have already decided that a rational discussion of religion is a topic forbidden from examination.So what is Dennett claiming?1.	Religion is a natural phenomenon (as opposed to being ‘supernatural’, not surprising since there is no evidence supporting the existence of the latter).2.	Religion’s roots are found in the predisposition of humans to perceive ‘agency’. Agency is the sense that there is a consciousness responsible for specific actions. This heuristic (mental shortcut) works well much of the time. When we see someone pick up a object we assume it’s because the person performing the action has a desire to pick it up. However, this approach goes awry when agency is associated with natural events … for example - my crops failed because the spirits were offended by something I did or failed to do. It’s a short jump from perceived agency to the animistic gods who control winds, water and weather and from there to the judgmental gods who are preternaturally concerned with the things you do with your clothes off.3.	Religion spreads through stories, and only the best stories survive. Much like evolution through natural selection the weakest ideas are culled from the herd while the fittest persist. Thus mythologies are refined over time to become ever more interesting and resonant and therefore more likely to be propagated - a concept captured by what Richard Dawkins has dubbed a ‘meme’ (cultural information that is transmitted by repetition and replication in a manner analogous to the biological transmission of genes).4.	Some of the means used by religions to make themselves more robust as memes include: ceremony, ritual, music, recitation, celebration, repetition and basically everything else you associate with a church service. More recently churches have turned to marketing of their product much like is done for other commercial products or services.5.	Another factor playing a role in religions tenacity is a prevalence of what Dennett calls ‘belief in belief’. Some people believe in god, but many more (including some atheists) feel belief, in and of itself is a good thing. Thus many ‘profess’ belief whether or not they are truly believers because they think it’s the right thing to do.6.	Faced with scientific explanations of the natural world that have pushed god into the gaps of scientific understanding, the concept of a personal god has been supplanted by that of a ‘prime mover’ or ‘first cause’ or ‘ground of being’ in the minds of many ‘sophisticated’ theologians. This god is an ineffable being about which no claims can be made and thus is made immune from being disproven. Unfortunately for these ‘sophisticated’ theologians the ineffable and the nonexistent are largely indistinguishable. Probably the most interesting idea that Dennett presents is the idea of ‘belief in belief’. It’s a fascinating concept that leads one to ask whether people actually believe in their religion or whether they are simply ‘professing’ to believe in their religion. It’s a difficult question to answer since ‘conviction’ is difficult to gage. However, we can draw some conclusions from people’s actual behavior:1.	Believers will do things when they think they are alone that they would never do if their mother was standing in the room watching them. This, despite the fact that they presumably believe god is watching them at all times. 2.	Believers grieve differently at a funeral than they do at the airport when seeing a loved one off. This, despite the fact that in both situations they presumably believe they will be reunited with those departing in the not-too-distant future. 3.	The fraction of believers who renounce material possessions and dedicate their lives to helping the poor is vanishingly small, despite the fact that it is instructed that they do so in their holy books.4.	Believers who receive a diagnosis of a terminal illness do not celebrate as if they had won the lottery even though it means they will soon arrive in an otherworldly paradise of peacefulness and bliss. Instead, they react with shock and horror in the same manner as an atheist who is fully aware that no afterlife exists.Why are people’s actual behavior so very different from the behaviors you would expect from someone who actually believes the propositions they profess? Do people truly believe what they profess to believe or do they simply ‘believe in belief’? Dennett doesn’t think there is an easy way to scientifically arrive at the truth, but the answer seems obvious. People who desperately wish for something to be true, will fervently do their best to believe it to be true. But reality intrudes. The world around us simply doesn’t support the proposition that god exists (god is missing, evil exists, death appears final). Thus I suspect most people do their best to not think about it very deeply because deep down inside, concealed from the world (and even to the extent they can, even from themselves) they know that religion isn’t true and behave accordingly. So, what about the book itself? As a philosopher Dennett is trained to ask probing and insightful questions. That’s fine as far as it goes, but in the absence of probing and insightful answers the result is somewhat unsatisfying. Dennett certainly discusses plausible explanations of the phenomenon he observes, but given that ideas do not leave fossil evidence behind we are unlikely to ever know whether the explanations are true or merely a form of ‘Just-So’ story.Also, Dennett’s style of writing just didn’t work for me. His informal, chatty and meandering style seemed to take forever to get around to the point. I suspect he is writing with the religious adherent in mind and is attempting to carefully and patiently convince them to question their preconceived beliefs. But I found this approach frustrating … like toying with a loose Band-Aid I kept wishing he'd just get on with it and tear it off already."
30,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
31,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
32,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
33,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
34,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
35,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
36,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
37,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
38,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
39,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
40,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."

Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
44,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."

Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
52,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
53,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
54,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
55,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
56,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
57,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."

I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
59,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
60,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
61,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
62,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
63,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
64,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
65,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
66,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself.

Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
68,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
69,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
70,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
71,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

73,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811414-frank-clark,2,"There was some good information and concepts in this book, but they were often very difficult to discover. Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
74,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."
75,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,5,"Daniel Dennett, a brilliant philosopher, devotes his book to analysing religion as a natural phenomenon. He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life. Why we don't trust the 'others' or what the modern science can reveal about our spiritual life, the concept of 'memes' in a way our brain stores the information and much more. An amazing book!"

Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
82,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
83,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."

The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
85,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
86,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
87,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
88,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
89,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
90,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
91,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
92,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
93,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
94,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
95,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
96,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
97,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
98,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
99,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
100,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
101,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

103,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811414-frank-clark,2,"There was some good information and concepts in this book, but they were often very difficult to discover. Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
104,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."
105,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,5,"Daniel Dennett, a brilliant philosopher, devotes his book to analysing religion as a natural phenomenon. He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life. Why we don't trust the 'others' or what the modern science can reveal about our spiritual life, the concept of 'memes' in a way our brain stores the information and much more. An amazing book!"

Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
112,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
113,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
114,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
115,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
116,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
117,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
118,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
119,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
120,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
121,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
122,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
123,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
124,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
125,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
126,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
127,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
128,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
129,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
130,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
131,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."
132,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19404467-c,5,"As a former evangelical Christian,now a new atheist(Naturalist-believing nothing exists outside the Natural World), this is one of my three new favorite nonfiction books December 11, 2012 Along with Why I Believed: Reflections of a Former Missionary and The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to ReadBreaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon by Daniel C.Dennett are the top three books that I feel every skeptic/new atheist/Naturalist, needs to have in their personal library.I read my library's copy of this book,but I just ordered my own copy as I know that I will want to re-read these books,as much as I used to study my Bible!They are a joy to read,since they make so much sense and are not full of contradictions like the Bible is.Breaking the spell did an awesome job of showing the similarities of religion to mythology and superstition,in easy to understand language,and that is where I found the greatest enlightenment and value.Very highly recommended!"
133,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811414-frank-clark,2,"There was some good information and concepts in this book, but they were often very difficult to discover. Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
134,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."
135,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,5,"Daniel Dennett, a brilliant philosopher, devotes his book to analysing religion as a natural phenomenon. He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life. Why we don't trust the 'others' or what the modern science can reveal about our spiritual life, the concept of 'memes' in a way our brain stores the information and much more. An amazing book!"

Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein

Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe ....

Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?

Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
142,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
143,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
144,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
145,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
146,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
147,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
148,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
149,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
150,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
151,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
152,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
153,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
154,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
155,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
156,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
157,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
158,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
159,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
160,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
161,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

163,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811414-frank-clark,2,"There was some good information and concepts in this book, but they were often very difficult to discover. Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
164,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."

He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life.

171,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1584391-john,3,"Can my faith survive the scrutiny of a critical analysis made in the name of science?  Is my christian experience of the same stripe or specie as that of the adherents of other world religions that no honest inquiry would discover it uniquely an indispensable contributor to my well-being and a witness to the realities that are found only in God?Will such an investigation into my spirituality show that my religion and my faith are simply part of my culture or my upbringing, that is to say, my christian experience is reducible to a ritual, the value of which, is only as a coping mechanism against hardship and pain?  Am I somehow culturally conditioned, like Topol in Fiddler on the Roof remarked about the value of traditions: Each one knows who he is and what is expected of him ... and in that spirit, life is stable, we accept our condition with reserved hope, and we live peaceably with one another.Is my belief in God nothing more than part of the human condition or is faith to me much more than all of this?  ... much, much more! 
Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
172,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
173,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
174,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
175,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
176,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
177,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
178,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
179,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
180,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
181,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
182,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
183,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
184,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
185,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
186,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
187,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
188,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
189,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
190,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
191,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
194,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."

He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life. Why we don't trust the 'others' or what the modern science can reveal about our spiritual life, the concept of 'memes' in a way our brain stores the information and much more. An amazing book!"

Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
202,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
203,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
204,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
205,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
206,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
207,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
208,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."

Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
210,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
211,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
212,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
213,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
214,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
215,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
216,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
217,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
218,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
219,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
220,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
221,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

223,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811414-frank-clark,2,"There was some good information and concepts in this book, but they were often very difficult to discover. Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
224,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."
225,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,5,"Daniel Dennett, a brilliant philosopher, devotes his book to analysing religion as a natural phenomenon. He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life. Why we don't trust the 'others' or what the modern science can reveal about our spiritual life, the concept of 'memes' in a way our brain stores the information and much more. An amazing book!"

Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
232,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
233,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
234,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
235,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
236,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
237,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
238,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
239,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
240,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
241,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
242,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
243,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
244,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
245,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
246,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
247,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
248,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
249,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
250,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
251,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

253,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811414-frank-clark,2,"There was some good information and concepts in this book, but they were often very difficult to discover. Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
254,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."
255,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,5,"Daniel Dennett, a brilliant philosopher, devotes his book to analysing religion as a natural phenomenon. He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life. Why we don't trust the 'others' or what the modern science can reveal about our spiritual life, the concept of 'memes' in a way our brain stores the information and much more. An amazing book!"

Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
262,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
263,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
264,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
265,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
266,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
267,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
268,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
269,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
270,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18585310-john-alt,3,"In Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Daniel Dennett hopes to break the spell--not of religious belief, but of the conviction that it is not a fit subject for scientific inquiry. Never the twain shall meet--this is a bad idea according to Dennett. Stephen Jay Gould wrote of ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" of both science and religion as worthy of respect in their own rights, but unbridgeable, the one to the other.Dennett takes exception to this, maintaining that religion is a fit subject for scientific scrutiny, and in doing so he draws upon evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. He speculates as to how a primitive belief in ghosts later became a belief in wind spirits, rain gods, wood nymphs, and leprechauns. According to Dennett, as hunter-gatherers became farmers, as they aggregated into prehistoric villages, a need to protect one's own arose--property, spouse, children, crops, livestock. Richard Dawkins' selfish gene no longer served the common weal. That is, genetic kinship among tribe members was not enough in itself to insure Darwinian cooperation. Shared beliefs rather than DNA enforced proper behavior. People became commanded by an authoritarian but vengeful god to do their duty to others not genetic kin.This is a tidy explanation, tying all up in a neat bundle, but there are the Neanderthals who were not fit inside. At digs of Neanderthal burial sites, something extraordinary was found, something which provides evidence of Neanderthal practices long before ours became the dominantly successful species. Around the burial site and bones of a beloved individual flowers and trinkets were carefully placed. They are extinct now, the Neanderthals, but could this mean that even they had a sense of the spiritual, a regard for an after life? I can see no other way to understand the findings. So much for Dennett's religion as emergent from the need for duty in communities. Something there is that cannot be packaged as well as he would have it. As Yeats put it, ""An aging man is but a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick unless soul clap hands, sing, and louder sing for every tatter in his mortal dress."" Religion was informed by spiritual as well as moral needs.Dennett draws upon the concept of memes--scientifically unverifiable and another Dawkins concept--to explain how primitive beliefs evolved into modern religions. ""Every minister in every faith is like a jazz musician keeping traditions alive by playing the beloved standards . . . but mixing familiarity and novelty in just the right proportions to grab the minds and hearts of their hosts."" Hosts here is meant to mean the same as an unsuspecting, sometimes insentient host for a virus, a parasite. According to Dennett, people are dumb, unwitting hosts for memes, in this case religious beliefs. I will add, they are also hosts for the vaunted faith in the scientific model as the only true way of understanding the universe.Sorry, Daniel, but I cannot get there from here. Nor can you. Dennett is playing in a mind-field, one that eventually will explain nothing and sets off duds.Although I do not have interest or belief in the dogma or doctrine of any religion, I do see all religions as serving a deep, human need. (I think Dennett would agree with me on this while he holds that humankind would be better off without the need.) The need is not served by a flawed scientific paradigm in which the objects of scientific investigation somehow are supposed to provide meaning. (Else, why are they pursued?) I am reminded of Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who famously remarked, “the more we find out about the universe, the more meaningless it all seems.” Meaningless, because science ignores the other magisterium, which at its core--though not always in tenets--points to what we all are, and teaches that fulfillment-meaning cannot be found in the objects of scientific research. John Gray continues for me.""One cannot make a sharp distinction between natural processes and supernatural agents unless one presupposes a view of the world something like that presented in the biblical creation story, and the distinction is not found in most of the world's religions. For example, in animism - which must rank as the oldest and most universal religion - spirits are seen as part of the natural world.More fundamentally, it is a mistake to assume that belief is the core of religion. This may seem self-evident to many philosophers, but in fact belief is not very important in most religions. Even within Christianity there are traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy, in which it has never been central. For the majority of humankind, religion has always been about practice rather than belief. In fixating on the belief-content of religion, Dennett emulates Christianity at its most rationalistic and dogmatic. Pascal knew better, and understood that faith is not so much the basis of the religious life as a derivative from it. Dennett mocks those who say that life without faith has no meaning as ""believers in belief"". Yet he displays a zealous faith in unbelief that is far more inimical to doubt, and there is more scepticism in a single line of the Pensees than in the whole of Dennett's leaden tome.Breaking the Spell approaches its subject with a relentless, simple-minded cleverness that precludes anything like profundity, and much of it seems designed to demonstrate the author's intellectual ingenuity rather than to advance the reader's understanding."" "
271,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12479580-scott-humphries,5,"The Fourth Horseman: Daniel Dennett, Philosopher. I finally waded into two of Dennett’s widely acclaimed works, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995) and Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). I read them concurrently almost by accident, which turned out well, as the earlier work establishes some beachheads on which Dennett relies in Breaking the Spell.In Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, Dennett set out to write a book “for those who agree that the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.” The book’s multitude of ideas is sometimes hard to keep in mind (and seems impossible to summarize effectively), but Dennett’s chapter-end recaps periodically re-orient you to the big picture. Overall, Dennett characterizes natural selection (“the single best idea anyone has ever had”) as an algorithm that “unifies the realm of life, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law.” Evolution moves the tree of life through the Library of Mendel (the collection of all possible genomes) mindlessly, recursively, and without goals. Dennett allows for and describes the help of “cranes,” subprocesses previously evolved that then speed local evolutionary progress (e.g. sexual reproduction, and the Baldwin effect). But he will not countenance “skyhooks,” unsupported and insupportable mind-first powers or processes, i.e. miracles. Dennett devotes much time to beating back the raft of post-1859 critics who’ve attempted to graft skyhooks of various kinds onto natural selection. Along the way, he exposes the most common misunderstanding of Darwinism: the idea that natural selection is a procedure FOR producing US: “Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm FOR producing US.” As Dennett notes, the winner of a coin-flipping tournament is mistaken if he thinks there has to be an explanation for why HE won; there’s merely a reason why SOMEBODY won.For Dennett, natural selection is a “universal acid” that “eats through just about every traditional concept.” A memeticist, Dennett extends the concept to cultural evolution, and it’s here you can see the seeds that would grow into Breaking the Spell twenty years hence. Memes, or ideas that propagate from person to person and “compete” with one another, allow humans to transcend genetics. Human culture, then, is a “crane-making crane,” not a divinely-provided skyhook. Dennett also casts morality among the objects of evolutionary origin, and he recounts a brief history of moral philosophy (characterizing Hobbes and Nietzsche as early sociobiologists) before opining on cultural evolution’s continuing navigation between Bentham and Kant in search of a useful “Moral First Aid Manual.""As I said, it’s easy to get lost in this book, and I found myself periodically re-reading prior set-up sections I thought I’d understood to make sense of a new idea or argument (a frustrating exercise on a Kindle). But the book is a tower of solid argument that appears to have caused serious rethinking of numerous aspects of philosophy, sociobiology and a host of other disciplines in the quarter-century since its publication. To boot, one critic also suggests it “rivals The Blind Watchmaker as creationists’ most cordially hated text.” Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is well worth the investment.Breaking the Spell is more approachable but just as ambitious. In it, Dennett uses the tools of evolutionary biology and memetics to describe theories of the origin of religion and development of modern religions, all the while making a plea for the further scientific study of the topic. “Those who are religious and believe religion to be the best hope of humankind cannot reasonably expect those of us who are skeptical to refrain from expressing our doubts if they themselves are unwilling to put their convictions under the microscope.” Although Dennett briefly recounts the traditional arguments about whether God exists (with the customary conclusion), this book isn’t about that exercise: it’s about religion as a practice instead, and “belief in belief.” “It is entirely possible to be an atheist and believe in belief in God.” Dennett advocates rolling up our sleeves and applying the scientific method to the study of religion qua religion, a task currently hindered by the ethical and moral force-field deflecting such efforts. Let’s determine whether the nascent evidence of health benefits accruing to those receiving well-chosen falsehoods is sound, and then we can “confront the ethical question of whether any amount of health benefits could justify such deliberate misrepresentation.”Dennett’s exposition of the origin and evolution of religion is somewhat truncated—at 339 pages, this is one of his shorter books. But the hundred-page appendix provides more depth if you’re unsatisfied with Dennett’s recitations of the main themes, and the effort is a far cry from the prosaic one-sentence explanation: homo sapiens and their bipedal forebears were naturally selected to attribute agency to anything they didn’t or couldn’t understand. Dennett describes early folk religions as offering several benefits including (1) divination, which reduced responsibility for decision-making and thereby reduced acrimony resulting from bad decisions, (2) shamanistic healing rituals which, even if their success were limited to the extent of the placebo effect, were still the only health care available. True belief seemed de rigueur: in folk religions, religious “practices” are a seamless part of participants’ practical lives, alongside hunting and gathering or tilling and harvesting. “One way to tell that they really believe in the deities to which they make their sacrifices is that they aren’t forever talking about how much they believe in their deities – any more than you and I go around assuring each other that we believe in germs and atoms. Where there is no ambient doubt to speak of, there is no need to speak of faith.”As folk religions matured with the advent of agriculture, the “transition from folk religion to organized religion is marked by a shift in beliefs from those with very clear, concrete consequences to those with systematically elusive consequences.” Humans had more time to reflect, and religions responded, generally by “sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof—a pattern found just about everywhere in human society.” The faithful began an expensive trade of time and/or money for access to those selling God’s gifts. Reverting to his Darwin’s Dangerous Idea lexicon, Dennett suggests that in the marketplace of ideas, practitioners “uncovered whatever Good Tricks are in the nearest neighborhoods in the Design Space of possible religions.” Dennett acknowledges that this “deliberately cold-blooded rational analysis of the marketplace for religious goods deeply offends many religious people. They don’t want to see themselves as cannily making a sound investment in the most effective purveyor of supernatural benefits.” But religions quickly became memes that fostered human solidarity in groups larger than extended family, and, citing Stark and Finke’s 2000 study, Dennett suggests that religious behavior is, in the long run, no exception to the rule that human behavior is loosely governed by cost-benefit calculations.Lots has been written about the historic processes by which polytheism morphed into monotheism (and, not mentioned by Dennett, left telltale signs, my favorite of which is that “Elohim” is plural), but Dennett’s focus is more on the theory that “belief in God joined forces with the belief in belief of God to motivate the migration of the concept of God in the Abrahamic religions away from concrete anthropomorphism to ever more abstract and depersonalized concepts.” The concept of God has transformed dramatically in the last several thousand years, and continues to do so, but we continue to use the same word. This is easily explained: “The believers in the belief in God have appreciated that the continuity of professing requires continuity of nomenclature, that brand loyalty is a feature so valuable that it would be foolish to tamper with.” As an aside, for Dennett, the rise in “belief in belief” may be contributing to the demonstrable flight from Catholicism: the doctrinal emphasis of the Catholic Church (i.e. legislating what you must believe) cannot withstand the appeal of laissez faire “non-credal” evangelical offerings (where “more attention is paid to free parking and babysitting than to the proper interpretation of scripture”).Dennett ultimately wrestles with two important questions: (1) is religion, all things considered, a good thing? and (2) does religion drive morality? Religion grew as a method of providing social infrastructure for creating and maintaining moral teamwork. But today, “when patterns of mutual trust are quite securely established in modern democratic states independently of any shared religious belief, the bristling defenses of religions against corrosive doubt begin to look vestigial, like fossil traces of an earlier epoch. We no longer need God the Policeman to create a climate in which we can make promises and conduct human affairs on their basis.” Yes, there’s a long list of positive accomplishments attributable to religious people, but let’s not forget Weinberg’s maxim: “Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things—that takes religion.” Religion remains the “most prolific source of the ‘moral certainties’ and ‘absolutes’ that [] zealotry depends on,” and religious moderates do precious little to “keep the cloak of religious respectability from being used to shelter the lunatic excesses.”So what’s to be done? Dennett concludes with the analysis of a particularly urgent quandary: how do we research and evaluate the effect of religious upbringing and education on children? At worst, children in the U.S. and elsewhere routinely die directly as a result of the religious views of their parents, through lack of medical care and otherwise. So too, research performed since Dennett published the book suggests religious indoctrination in children stunts critical thinking skills (duh). As Dawkins said, “We’d be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo-conservative child. So isn’t it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child?” Yes, of course it is; these identifications prejudge decisions not properly considered. Dennett has some specific proposals to consider on this front and others, but, he warns, they will require research that will not be easy to come by.In the meantime, he suggests, “if we start holding religious organizations accountable for their claims—not by taking them to court but just by pointing out, often and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, that of course these claims are ludicrous—perhaps we can slowly get the culture of credulity to evaporate.” Amen."
272,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,4,"There are lots of different kinds of atheist books out there, and contrary to popular (mis)conception, they are not all angry, nor are all they all written by scientists with an axe to grind against the creationists. I have read some of the angry books, and while I enjoyed them, I certainly wouldn't recommend them to a religious believer, because they would only succeed in raising the believer's hackles and putting them in such a defensive position that all debate would be stonewalled. It's not an issue of ""respect"" (because the primary point of being an atheist is that religious beliefs don't deserve respect) but rather one of intention and the tone that goes along with that intention. If your intention – like Christopher Hitchens' – is to rock the boat and make complacent atheists or noncommital agnostics realize all the work that needs to be done, then your tone should rightfully be impassioned and indignant. Dennett's intention in Breaking the Spell is different. His goal is to assuage believers' fears about conversing with an atheist, put them at their ease, and talk about a few specific issues calmly and rationally with the goal of getting people to think more clearly about several unspoken and traditionally taboo subjects. No histrionics, no hyperbole, no accusations – just letting the facts speak for themselves. Needless to say, there are atheists (like me) who find this approach refreshing and more approachable than the writings of people like Hitchens, which, while still important and necessary, are not the kinds of books you can necessarily give to a religious person unless you are intending to piss them off.Dennett's book is so well-reasoned, well-argued, and well-written that you could give it to your doddering old grandmother, who has followed Jesus her entire life, and chances are she would not feel unduly scandalized by what the book says (especially if she already accepts evolution as a fact of life, which Dennett chooses not to convince people of in this book, since he has an entire other book devoted to that topic). Dennett is not ambiguous about his stance as an atheist or his belief that religion is not a prerequisite for moral behavior, but he is open-minded about so many issues and trusts so much in the scientific method and reasoned debate to resolve problems that you can't help but respect and like him and his common sense approach. True, if you are a real dyed-in-the-wool Bible-beater, you will find the entire premise of this book – that religion has evolved naturally (as opposed to supernaturally) over the course of recent human history under specific circumstances and its evolution and appeal through the ages can be explained through understanding human psychology and sociology – offensive and disrespectful. But finding something disrespectful is not the same as proving something wrong, and it also doesn't do away with your ability (obligation, even) to confront the evidence that the other side has assembled. The surest way to support your point of view and convince people of its validity, after all, is to allow it to stand on its own in the full light of inquiry. And even if you are afraid of the results, you cannot deny more courageous minds the right to discover them. Dennett does an excellent job of not setting up a straw-man argument – he lets the religious point of view shine through in each chapter and even goes to some length to show how these viewpoints could be right, while ultimately showing that they are not all that persuasive when examined more carefully from a wider perspective on human history."
273,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,Quite an enjoyable and informative listen. Thid book tackles the subject with great sensitivity and accuracy. The book doesn't really talk about wether religion is correct or not but talks about why we should investigate that question in a broad manner. The arguments mentioned in this book should be delivered to all people to seek a better future.
274,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Overall, this is an excellent review from Daniel Dennett of the ways in which religions might have emerged as natural phenomena in early humans, and how the pressures of evolution on this new set of social constructs might have then produced many of the traits we see in today's religions. His argument adds important elements to a pure psychological view of religion, although it certainly starts there. In the early chapters, Dennett argues that humans have what he calls an ""intentional stance"": that in order to best predict the world, we tend to think of things in the world as rational agents, and figure out the desires, and thus the actions, of that agent. This works brilliantly for other humans, and it works pretty well for the animals that early humans might need to hunt or escape. Thus it's easy for us to see how we might extend the same logic to other things - the weather, diseases, and so forth. From this, we can see how we might have grown to attribute apparently random changes in (say) the weather to an unseen entity behind the weather itself, and to then see the changes in the weather as reflecting true intentions of that entity. If you want to get it to rain, therefore, it makes perfect sense to try and communicate with the entity behind it, and to get the entity to cause it to rain. We attribute ""agency"" to the weather, and it makes sense then to try and bargain with the agent.(As I write this, we're in lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and this desire to treat the disease as an entity with intentions, capricious or malignant though they might be, is very visible in the way many people talk about it.)From here, Dennett grows the argument. Everything we value, or are fearful of, we value or fear for reasons. This view of the world gives us challenges in everyday living, which early folk religions enabled us to handle, psychologically. Once in the culture, these folk religions were susceptible to the same evolutionary pressures - this time at the level of ""memes"" that thrive or die out - as humans themselves, only many many times faster that physical evolution. Only the best variants of these beliefs will propagate - and ""best"" means most successful in meeting our deep psychological and physical needs. As human societies grew, specialised intercessors to these agents emerged (""shamans"", he calls them for convenience). Dennett goes on to suggest that these shamans, and others, had time to become more reflective, and so from these early folk religions, organized religions began to emerge. Sometimes, the simple beliefs in the folk religions were bolstered or even entirely replaced by carefully crafted reasoning. At this point, it might have become necessary to put some of these religious views out of the reach of ""gnawing skepticism"", as Dennett puts it. This leads to an interesting way of splitting the world:""This winnowing has the effect of sequestering a special subset of cultural items behind the veil of systematic invulnerability to disproof - a pattern found just about everywhere in human societies. As many have urged, this division into the propositions that are designed to be immune to disconfirmation and all the rest looks like a hypothetical joint at which we could well carve nature. Right here, they suggest, is where (proto-)science and (proto-)religion part company""Dennett rightly spends a fair while on this point. Is it right that we treat religion, by definition, as ""systematically immune to confirmation or disconfirmation? ... No religion lacks these effects, and anything that lacks them is not really a religion, however much it is like a religion in other regards."" Dennett rightly points out that this view wasn't shared by the shamans themselves: if they saw they were losing their flock to the shaman down the road, they were quite prepared to take on new approaches and ideas - to evolve. So one of the important features that emerged as folk religion merged and became organized religions was this secrecy and systematic invulnerability to disconfirmation. Now we see Dennett broaden the view out from the leaders to the groups who also believed. He sees this as in many cases an entirely rational decision to join on the part of individuals, who would see benefits from being part of a group regardless of possible supernatural benefits from the gods themselves. There are also many possible psychological benefits in belief, but there is a darker side as well - tribalism in humans is very often reinforced by conflict, and the tendency of religions to spark conflicts and wars from prehistory to the modern day is terrifying. Of course it could be argued that they were being co-opted by pre-existing power structures, but none the less the features of very many religions do seem to be shaped, and often thrive, on conflict.At this point, Dennett spends a while talking about ""belief in belief"". This, he argues, is a very powerful force, in religions and elsewhere, and can completely transform them. For example, he points out that many feel it's important to maintain the belief in democracy, regardless of its flaws. So we tend to play down the flaws and play up the benefits, and in doing so lose track of the logic which may (or may not) support the arguments for its value. Similarly with science - we may believe in science, we may believe that ""e=mc2"", without knowing (or caring) how it is so. None the less, we believe! And, he argues, the same is true of religions. Even very devout followers may not share identical views on details of doctrine, and many lay believers will turn out to have quite different interpretations of major points. But it doesn't matter - what matters is that they all share the belief in the importance of their beliefs. Finally, Dennett looks at religions today. He starts to talk about whether religion is, all things considered, a good thing. Is religion good for people, he asks? There is definitely evidence that belonging to religious organisations can improve the morale, and hence the health, of participants. Believers would also argue that the meaning it gives their lives is immeasurably valuable. More specific experiments, for example on the benefits of ""intercessory prayer"", give mixed results, and include at least one notorious case of academic fraud. Finally, almost all religious people see their religion as the foundation of their morality. On this point, Dennett comments ""I have uncovered no evidence to support the claim that people, religious or not, who don't believe in reward in heaven and/or punishment in hell are more likely to kill, rape, rob, or break their promises than people who do. The prison population in the United States shows Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and others - including those with no religious affiliation - represented about as they are in the general population ... Indeed, the evidence to date support the hypothesis that atheists have the lowest divorce rates in the United States, and born-again Christians the highest.""There is a lot I really liked about this book. The arguments are thorough, carefully constructed, and evidence is sought wherever possible. Some technical material is present in appedices, a couple of which I found useful I am, I should point out, not a religious believer of any creed, although I do think that there is a deep human need (which I feel) for the spiritual, and so I can't comment on how a theist would have felt. I hope they would have been able to read the arguments through to the end, and Dennett I feel does a good job of presenting the best arguments on both sides. There were a few irritations, for me at least. The very first chapter or two nearly caused me to give up, as Dennett spends an entirely unnecessary (for me) amount of time justifying the whole enterprise. He's also very fond of italics to emphasise key words in his paragraphs, and sometimes this is perhaps too heavy handed. But it's a forgiveable style. Four and a half stars, rounded up to five on final consideration. "
275,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"While I agree with much of what Dennett has written in this book, I couldn't help myself asking why he bothered to write this at all. He cites Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained and Scott Atran's In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion to establish religion as an evolutionary by-product, or ""spandrel"" per Stephen Jay Gould. A number of the ideas he expounds on here are derived from these two books as well. To cut to the chase, I'd say just to skip this entirely and pick up one of the two aforementioned books (Boyer for a more lay-oriented treatment and Atran for a more academic one). Both offer a more lucid and thorough explanation of ""religion as a natural phenomenon."" Dennett spends an inordinate amount of time navel-gazing about what a scientific study of religion would look like but quotes fairly extensively from the literature on the psychology of religion in other sections of the book! What is the point here? He becomes fixated on the strange notion that there is a taboo on studying religion scientifically within academia, which is not at all the case. There is even a journal explicitly called Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTi...) which does not allow theological submissions.Dennett's memetics fetish comes through here as well, of course. Atran devotes an entire chapter to a refutation of memetics in his book and, needless to say, I found Dennett's response to be superficial and unconvincing. I will give Dennett credit for formulating meme theory in a far more sensible fashion than its other proponents, but I still consider the whole deal to be bordering on, if not outright, pseudoscience.I am echoing some of the complaints made by Armin W. Geertz in his talk ""How Not To Do The Cognitive Science of Religion"" (http://www.commongroundgroup.net/wp-c...), though I think Geertz is a bit overly harsh on Dennett and is far more enthusiastic about memes than I am.""What's the point?"" A question I kept asking myself through much of this book, despite being in broad agreement with Dennett."
276,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Dennett's underlying concern in this book is the growth of fanaticism among the adherents of religions - especially Islamist terrorism, but also extremists within Christianity, Judaism, and Hinduism. He believes that a major obstacle in addressing fanaticism is the general reluctance to submit religion and religious belief to scientific inquiry - to understand it, in other words, as a naturally occurring phenomenon. Religions, which regard themselves as grounded in the supernatural, are well defended against this method of inquiry, and Dennett devotes much of his book to an analysis of these defenses.For readers who are neither philosophers nor biologists, this book will be a challenge. While Dennett uses a conversational, sometimes slyly humorous lecture style to introduce and discuss the many aspects of his subject, it's often difficult to understand how all the pieces fit together. Ironically, you may end up following him ""in faith"" that it all adds up somehow to a seamless argument.While the book's title suggests that it will show the way to break religion's spell, it delivers something rather different from that. Maybe most discouraging (depending on the reader's expectations) is Dennett's admission that there are few answers currently to the questions he is raising and insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses he is posing. Instead, a lay reader will learn engaging new concepts like free-floating rationales, intentional objects, and hyperactive agent detection devices - and learn them in memorable ways (with the help at one point of Elizabeth II and Cameron Diaz), as well as how meme theory relates to the spread and tenacity of religious doctrines, plus an exploration of the difference between belief and belief in belief.Finally, the book is a call to action to researchers to bring the illuminating light of scientific investigation to bear on religion and to test its claims instead of continuing to regard it as a sacred cow. Among potentially useful results, we may be able to deflect the worst excesses of fanaticism before its toxic effects destroy those secular values many also believe in - democracy, justice, freedom, and free inquiry itself. "
277,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6434666-daniel,2,"First off, this might be obvious, but if you're not fairly interested in the subject, this is likely to be a pretty dull experience. Now for the actual book. I think Dennett did a very fine job dissecting all his reasoning, and then come to his final verdicts, perhaps, too good a job. While reading I felt a bit bored for the first 250 or so pages, which is quite a chunk of the book, and only then, do the more interesting stuff start. I could use a little more conclusions and opinions in the first part of the book, even if he would put something forward, and then explain himself after, just to make the blood boil or raise the heartbeat. Apart from that I think a lot of what he said seems pretty natural and self explanatory, but that might just be me (I'm not raised religious, and I live in one of the most secular countries in the world, which might be why). My rating on the book is based on these things and on the fact that I can't help but compare it a little bit to The God delusion (R. Dawkins), God is not great (C. Hitchens) and The end of fate (S. Harris), which I've all read within the last two years. I feel the four books cover a lot of the same ground, perhaps not in the conclusions they make, but in the reasons they present. And with this in mind I feel this is the least interesting of the four.If however, you're religious and want to know more about the whole atheist deal and why a lot of people think like that, without having someone yell and halfway insult you, this is likely to be a better choice than Hitchens or Dawkins, since this have a fairly gentle feel to it, and it doesn't put out provocative statements without explaining itself in a decent manner first. This however, is my take on it, of cause. "
278,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Dennett establishes the foundations of an empirical program for the study of religion, which requires that he establishes (and he does) reasons for thinking of religion as a natural phenomenon, using meme theory and evolutionary theory to do so. Dennett dispels some of the myths and prejudices surrounding religion and its 'special status' in the eyes of both hardline religious folk and sensitive mutliculturalist academic/leftist sorts. Aside from some pretty minor issues, this is a sophisticated philosophical account of how the discourse surrounding religion functions, and how we might hope to break the spell.Dennett is an atheist, and although he's been identified as one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, he is, unlike them (Harris is something of a different case than Dawkins and Hitchens, as he was a Philosophy undergrad and is quite careful intellectually), not really a polemicist, although he is a terrific rhetorician. For those of us familiar with Dennett, it's not hard to figure out that he thinks that breaking the spell is the first step toward the death of religion, or at least its more pernicious forms, but the book itself is not an atheistic screed, even if you go beyond Dennett's rhetoric, as it genuinely seeks to establish a way of properly understanding religion and the discourse surrounding it, instead of just yelling at 'the other side' in a pseudo-debate."
279,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855053-becky,4,"Although he is a member of the group of freethinkers and ""new atheists"" who are now speaking out in print against religion, Dennet takes a somewhat different approach. He lays out a case for subjecting religious tenets to scientific scrutiny, treating religion as a natural phenomenon that should be investigated with as much detachment and scientific curiosity as the fundamental forces, elementary particles, or chemical/biological processes. Occasionally I wasn't sure if he was arguing for investigation of religious claims (miracles, virgin birth, resurrection, etc.), or investigation of why we believe these things (along the lines of ""Born to Believe""). There seemed to be both arguments going on, and they often overlapped.One other point--I got the feeling a number of times that his arguments were a bit disingenuous...though he urged scientific investigation, his discussion seemed to be intended to reveal why such investigation will actually be fruitless in the case of most religious claims...because there is nothing to investigate. But even though I wasn't entirely convinced of his sincerity, I was entertained and enlightened by his discussion."
280,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"""These are questions worth further investigation."" This could be the theme of this book.So, I've read three of the four books written after Nine Eleven by the ""Four Horsemen"" of atheism. Of them, only Sam Harris's The End of Faith was published prior to this one. This book takes a different, more dispassionate, tack. It looks at the question of how religion came about and why it persists. Dennett directly addresses believers, asking them to question themselves, and with each question he invites them to step a tiny bit further out of their comfort zone. In some ways I feel he's a little too accommodating to the other side, but it became clear early on that people like me are not the primary audience of this book. I'd like my xian friends, relatives, and acquaintances to read Sam Harris's book, but that's not likely. But those who are more liberal, who think there are worthy books besides the bible, might be persuaded out of their certainty in their particular faith by these reasoned, quiet questions."
281,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"An extremely fascinating idea of religion as a human symbiote that was inculcated into our consciousness as a meme in prehistory. Subsequently as human evolution progressed, the meme evolved into organized religion. This would have been a far better book if written by someone with a background in evolutionary biology since the great idea that the book is famous for is lost in mandering arguments looking at a concept from every possible angle even after the reader 'gets' the point and would like to move to the crux of the matter. A major chunk of the book is written to explain why the book has been written in the first place. Although the author mentions that the philosopher's job is to ask the right questions rather than answer them, the book suffers from an overt attention to detail justifying the right questions to ask rather than discussing the fascinating ideas they lead to. A detailed discussion of the Attachment theory within the psychology of religion and how it compares with the meme idea would have made this book even better."

283,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811414-frank-clark,2,"There was some good information and concepts in this book, but they were often very difficult to discover. Dennett is extremely wordy - often needlessly so. And after finishing the book, I'm still struggling to understand exactly what many of his points were. Ultimately he falls short of living up to the title. I had been looking forward to reading Dennett for some time, and I can honestly say that, after this book, I won't pick up another of his. Finally, I really find it pompous when someone quotes their previous works and cites them as reference."
284,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84696143-ben-moore,2,"I've had a personal project for a while which was to read work by each of the 'Four Horsemen' of new atheism. I'm not an atheist, I'm an evangelical Christian, but I value truth and intellectual integrity so it didn't seem right to ignore them. I'll admit that I left Daniel Dennett til last, simply because I didn't know anything about him. Having read the (recently publish in a nice hardback edition) transcript of the conversation between the 'Four Horsemen' (I'm not sure they particularly like that title), I thought he seemed like a pretty reasonable and quite nice guy. This book has led me to consider that I may have been wrong.Before even touching on the arguments raised and whether I agree/disagree with them, I want to mention the tone of this book. Apologies for the incoming rant. Please feel free to skip the next paragraph. Dennett is unbearably condescending and insulting all the way through. No, this doesn't make him wrong, but it does make this book tedious to read. He constantly punctuates arguments with statements along the lines of 'of course, you'll be very offended by this and probably want to stop reading, but have you considered you might be wrong?' Yes, Dennet, I have. Once or twice, this is completely innocuous. Delivered constantly, it becomes patronising. He also rather wonderfully gives himself a get-out-of-jail-free card in one of his final notes by stating that angry people will play the 'I'm offended' card but the only reason this could happen is because they've misunderstood him. Between his condescending attitude and his constant use of strawmen (he creates a character called 'Professor Faith' whose arguments he can deftly counter), I think people might actually be offended because he's a smug sod.Now down to the actual content. Daniel Dennett makes an interesting case at the beginning of this book for the fact that science should be able to investigate religious belief. This is a good point, and one that I fully agree with. However, he then proceeds to ignore any other forms of investigation such as history, archaeology etc. This means we are left with a very long discussion about how certain ideas (not necessarily just religious ideas) could have developed naturally, but without any consideration as to whether any of the claims could actually be measured. I can't speak for all religious believers, I can only respond in my capacity as a Christian, but this seem bizarre to me as someone who actually tries to investigate the truth of my faith. Though of course, as Dennett conveniently explains, religious believers who make investigations are usually only doing so to 'scratch an itch' and convince themselves they're being open minded. Which is convenient.We could make a pretty good case, using Dennett's method, that the idea of King Henry VIII was a useful myth that evolved over time. This would make perfect sense until we looked at evidence as to whether or not he existed. When I say 'science should be used in its rightful place', I don't mean that it has nothing to say about religion. What I mean is that a purely scientific analysis leaves out useful ideas. Though it could, of course, be argued that good history uses the scientific method anyway.Another thing about this book that makes me slightly wary is that the 'explanation' of religious belief developing naturally is a complete hypothetical. Not only that, but it's a multi-layered hypothetical with hypotheticals evolving from previous hypotheticals until we reach the ultimate hypothetical theory for religion, taking no account of reality. No doubt, theories have to be theorised before they can be investigated and proven or disproved, but if the unique selling point of your book is an explanation of religion as a natural phenomenon, shouldn't you have an explanation ready? Or shouldn't you be honest about the fact that it's actually just a pet theory?Dennett asks excellent questions that I think, in a different context, would make a compelling and deeply challenging book. Does religion make you a good person? Or does it (as a paraphrase of Dennett's own unbearably self-righteous statement) merely bring ordinary people up to the same level of morality and citizenship as him and his fellow 'brights'? How much tolerance should we really show to 'dangerous' beliefs? Just what should we allow a parent to teach their children? Unfortunately, the application of these questions in Breaking The Spell appears to be related to the actual truth of religions. But none of them actually relate to truth. Like Hitchens, Harris, and Dawkins, Dennett seems to think that things he finds unsavoury are signs of falsehood.I could go on but I'm not the best at writing reviews and I tend to get a bit bitter. I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a challenging, insightful read by a respectful author. Instead I found it to be a dull, uninspired diatribe disguised as modesty and understanding. I have a fairly long list of other books by the 'Four Horsemen' that I would like to read but, for the first time, I find myself quite put off. Dennett says the following about people who reject the idea of objective truth, but I think it summarises my feelings about the new atheists pretty well: 'It is hard to convey how boring this relentless barrage of defensive sneering is, so it is not surprising that some investigators have stopped trying to rebut it, and settle for poking fun at it instead'."
285,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,5,"Daniel Dennett, a brilliant philosopher, devotes his book to analysing religion as a natural phenomenon. He looks at religion from multiple points and comments on how our beliefs shape our reality and influence all aspects of everyday life. Why we don't trust the 'others' or what the modern science can reveal about our spiritual life, the concept of 'memes' in a way our brain stores the information and much more. An amazing book!"

Escape
Daniel Dennett in his work, Breaking the Spell intends to find out, by subjecting my belief—or at least my belief in belief—to the rigors of scientific discovery as one might study... say, music.  Music has been dissected as a series of sounds (notes and tones) produced in arrangements intended to stir certain feelings or encourage certain types of behavior in the listener.Why do I enjoy Sirius/XM's Escape channel when I am in a quiet mood or wish for background music accompanying my reading?  Why does the Enlighten channel stir thoughts of praise to God?  Why do I get romantic listening to the Love channel?  Why do I tend to react in more or less predictable ways emotionally while listening to selective genre of music?  And why are some my favorites and others I never listen to?    Why do Vivaldi's violins or a romantic saxophone send me into a glazed over mood, daydreaming of love?It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure. -- Albert Einstein
Worried?
Can my faith be analyzed in this manner?  Why do I believe in God?  Why do I maintain He answers prayer, or at least, He hears me when I pray?  And is this nothing more than my being religious?It is well known that the parent-offspring link  is the major pathway of transmission of religion. Dennett, pg. 86 [Proverbs 22:6]Dennett adds:Some concepts happen to trigger our emotional programs in particular ways.  Some ... happen to connect to our social mind.  Some.. become plausible and direct behavior.  The ones that do all this are the religious ones we actually observe .... "" Dennett. pg. 107.But even Dennett admits: It will take decades of research to secure any of this theory. pg. 108.He proposes to explain in natural, no-god-needed, terms why I am religious.  And admittedly in mock sensitivity he wonders:  Will such an up close look at my religion damage my faith in God?  If the cloak of mysticism and the miraculous is removed, will what is discoverable underneath be nothing more than generations of attending church, synagogue, temple or mosque?  And I will fail to see any emotional connection worth keeping and attending?  ""It is time to confront the worry.""  he marches on.Many of Generation X are now confronted with a need to re-evaluate their faith and their religious experience.  Dennett appeals to their understanding, and in large part to their education.  While the older generation seeks to rest secure in their lifelong convictions and traditions, the younger generations struggle to discover what those convictions and traditions should be for them—if at all.And what about me!?  How secure is my faith in the reality of God in my life to make all Dennett's nice sounding words nothing more than—to use his own phrase with my spin on it: a GOOD TRICK.
Wineskins
""What explains religion?"" Dennett asks (pg. 92).Early in his book he underscores the importance of the theory of evolution—not creationism—in understanding where religion came from.A social historian or an anthropologist who knows a great deal about the beliefs and practices of people all around the world but is naive about evolution is ... unlikely to frame issues well.  Dennett, pg. 104....religion is a social phenomenon designed (by evolution).... Ibid. pg. 106d...to explain the hold various religious ideas and practices have on people, we need to understand the evolution of the human mind. Ibid. pg. 106ff.He refers to the evolutionary underpinnings of religion calling it a cultural evolution.Admittedly, culture is something that evolves or develops through generations of social change.  Some of what we do, we do because it just feels or seems right although we have no rationale to explain why.  The Christmas tree is one that currently comes to mind.  I am reminded of a story.The story is told of a young girl inquiring of her mother why she cut the shank end of a roast off before putting it into the roaster.  Her mother didn't know and redirected the youth to ask grandma.  Grandma drew a blank as well but since great grandma was still alive, the young lady went to her for an answer?""You see, sweetheart, back in our day the pots were too small for the roast and we had to cut the end off to get it to fit.""In like manner we do carry over cultural practices and even rituals that may have no further practical value.  The present generation of the faithful may merely be going through the motions and receiving nothing of value in it.  Luke 5:37  - Old wine in new wineskins?
Religion
Dennett, then, is analyzing religious practice and ritual in evolutionary terms.Everything we value—[including] religion—we value for reasons.  Lying behind, and distinct from, our [Dennett's emphasis] reasons  are evolutionary reasons, free-floating rationales that have been endorsed by natural selection. ...  The apparent extravagance of religious practices can be accounted for in the austere terms of evolutionary biology -- Dennett, pg. 93.But can my faith in God be spoken of separate from my religion?  Do I know that regardless of which religious ritual I practice, my trust in God is not dependent on these outward expressions of worship?  Do I know that if the electricity went out and the sound system went dead, the stores ran out of incense and wine and the choir didn't practice this week (half of them have the flu including the orchestra) I could still worship God within the sanctuary of my own heart?  [Habakkuk 3:17]And what if some of the doctrines I believed as important turned out in the light of new archeological discoveries to be wrong and discardable?  Can I limit my need to know [Deuteronomy 29:29] to a child's understanding of the message of Calvary?  Can I sense the love of God toward me and let that be sufficient until all things are revealed?  This would make Dennett's theory—though he might be correct about religion (and that's a 'might'), nonetheless—mute as regards faith.What might such a test show if somehow my faith brought comfort in suffering, peacefulness in death (we wait on this one), no need for explanations for the unanswerable mysteries of life, and fellowship with those of like heart regardless of circumstances or denomination ties?   What if my worship of God didn't need any particular ritual or form to be alive and well?Dennett is correct about church ritual and practice: We should resist the... temptation to postulate some sort of ... genius ...to explain [it].""  (pg 79ff)  But that is not where my devotion to God lies.  To confuse my faith with some religious practice is comparable to explaining the value of an egg in terms of the shell or the value of a person by the clothes they wear.Christians should not be known by their church affiliations but their faith in and love for God.
Faith
This is not to make our worship styles and expressions meaningless but we must be worshipping God in spirit and truth and not just form. [John 4:24]  This we already know.My faith cannot depend on the preacher.  After all, his or her display of faith might be tied, in part, to a paycheck or popularity or a tradition and not just the bare necessity of trusting God.   I don't say that to accuse him or her of false motives but even the preacher needs to strip away all other provisions that support what they believe and leave them with raw reliance on God.  And this fact is so private it isn't always evident in their message. Some might accuse me here of describing a blind faith, being brain-washed, or compartmentalizing my beliefs separate from my realities.  Argue that point with Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego.  [Daniel 3:16-18]I do not intend to resign my faith to accusation or the twist of a phrase.  My faith cannot depend on my ability to out argue my critics.  I have the Veritas Forum and Dr. Willian Lane Craig for that if I need them.  Faith should need not depend solely on post-graduate degrees or high I.Q.'s of proponents for support.I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.The lure of criticism is to pull us into discussions we cannot possibly win, points of debate they can argue fluently but which we are unacquainted with.  For most christians, the spider's web of discussions intent on persuading us that there is no God is made of strands of impressive ideas and assumptions.  These are made of an alluring, imprisoning logic we never before imagined.  Entangled, we begin to find reasonable a rational so foreign to the biblical message we may have once held sacred.I am not saying don't study atheistic thought.  I am enjoying Dennett's book.  Taking a closer look at the purity of my faith is a worth while study in introspection [James 1:23-24]—grading the effectiveness of my religious experience against the answer sheet Christ Himself gave [Matthew 25:35-36].Only if I can see through the assumptions being made in the name of science which are yet to be proven and I carefully consider the bias all writers write in—the spin being put on the use of statistics as well as non-relevant points of interests that do not bear at all on the question of my faith and salvation—can I approach an accurate appraisal of my christian experience?If my faith is real.Also my faith shouldn't need a daily dose of miracles to survive.  Like Elijah, one meal (one unforgettable encounter with God ) can last a life time and provide strength for the journey.... as it should. [I Kings 19:7-8]"
292,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,4,"Dennett's Breaking the Spell is an ambitious work of a fundamentally speculative nature. The basis of Dennett's propositions and suppositions in the book rest on his adherence to Neo-Darwinism (ND). This is not a fault, since ND is the current accepted understanding of genetics and evolution by most scientists. In fact, Dennett provides a many references for reading that, he insists, will convince any skeptic of evolution if, over the course of a few months, these readings are read and understood. Dennett holds a firm grasp on modern evolutionary theory, and he uses this as the crux for his scientific position toward investigating the natural history of religion.By ""natural history,"" he means the history of how religion has manifested naturally in our species and occurs naturally among cultures and ethnic groups around the world. At the outset, this approach is appealing, since it opens the door to study not only religion but also religious belief and, to a lesser degree, faith. Drawing from contemporary resources in biology and anthropology, Dennett attributes the phenomenon of religion to evolutionary biology (e.g., Dawkins’ memism) and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Barrett’s concept of HADD), and he examines religion’s interplay with science (drawing from Gould’s Rocks of Ages) as well as its recycled, unoriginal contents (e.g., Ainslie’s epistemic taboos) and many, many other attributes. Breaking the Spell is, in some sense, a wonderful collection of the many accounts from scholars who have attempted to unpack religion and study it using the scientific method. This is really quite a wonderful approach to the subject, since religion, like knee-jerk reactions to loud sounds, is fundamentally a part of our species, and as a result must, I think, be studied using all the tools that are used to study us, like biology, psychology, and anthropology.Of course, it’s very difficult to study religion with the tried-and-true techniques of science, because not only are religions so vast and different but even more so are its adherents. Dennett also discusses faith and belief in belief in God, but since religious belief can be varied, distinct, and so evidently contradictory among believers, it is immensely difficult to scrutinize “religious belief” proper. David Hume and William James are some who tackled this effort valiantly but not with great success. Dennett also reminds the reader many times throughout the book that science itself is not a religion. Like religion, science has evolved into something quite robust, but for different reasons and in different ways; it is not a religion itself but a method – a method that can be motivated through belief and faith, but a method alone.Although the author does not consider this, I think it’s possible that religion occurs naturally because humanity is inherently self-centered, self-concerned, fearful, proud, and rational. The last ingredient is the most interesting, because upon mixing all these components together, what results is a concoction where man creates agents, superstitions, and concepts that are “greater than” or more powerful than himself, sometimes in the image of himself (though the religious would say it’s the other way around), to which man is innately connected (i.e., man’s “connection” to God and the universe), and for which is the reason of man’s being, the universe’s being, and everything else that is seemingly inexplicable and incomprehensible (“Science can’t explain that!”). These ideas, along with our inclination to fall into small groups with leaders and those who think alike, have evolved from folk taboo and culminated into modern religions, like Scientology and Christianity, and religious belief, like believing it's God's will that Jews should eat only kosher foods when observing kashrut.All in all, Dennett’s book is good. It’s well researched, it’s full of ideas, but it doesn’t provide definitive answers, which may frustrate readers. Readers may also not appreciate Dennett’s writing style or sense of humor, but this is a minor quibble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment regarding this work is its length in comparison to the author’s other, more scrupulous works, such as Consciousness Explained or Darwin’s Dangerous Idea – although many discussions in the book are fundamentally deep, I don’t think Dennett goes deep or far enough. There is simply much more Dennett can and should have addressed here, but he pardons himself at the outset acknowledging this book is merely a taster. It’s a good taster, but it could and should have been much more. Also, read the appendices. They're asides full of even more interesting information and help to provide context and background surrounding Dennett's research in writing the book."
293,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"Dennett does an excellent job with Breaking the Spell. Not because the book is conclusive, or comprehensive, or transcendent to the point of possibly starting a cult. No, the quality of Breaking the Spell is not in being definitive; it is in having the ability to make the reader questions themselves. When a book forces a level of introspection, a questioning of personal assumptions, it is a book worthy of praise.Many people believe a book that tackles a taboo subject matter such as religion has to, by default, provide definitive answers that can be examined, reduced, and ultimately torn apart by empirical or logical mechanisms. Untrue, for the default position to questions both big and small is “I don’t know”. A book that makes you break parts of yourself apart does not have to provide the instructions to put yourself back together. The power of Breaking the Spell is in the questions it asks, or the arguments it debunks by asking unanswered questions, or providing countervailing evidence. Dennett tasked himself to search & digest as much of the social and biological phenomenon that could affect religious belief, focusing on North America without completely shirking the rest of the world.People fail to realize the importance of debunking claims, hypotheses, or theories. The true strength in the scientific method is the null hypothesis, especially when it’s backed up by going through the list of logical fallacies. Dennett proves to be a legionnaire in Breaking the Spell, advancing and slashing his way through the ranks of assumptions, flowery rhetoric, and blank slatism rife in religious/cultural apologists. When someone makes a positive assertion that something exists, and that something has specific characteristics, burden of proof comes into play. Filling a void of understanding with unproven assertions is pure intellectual laziness and wishful thinking, something Dennett and I agree is backwards thinking anywhere under any circumstances.Dennett also tackles the results of religion in a Pro/Con way. Realizing the assertions of supernatural claims are at best unfalsifiable, he looks further into whether religions and their institutions provide tangible benefits. This is where Dennett understands he cannot simply write them off as massive negatives that should be abolished through education or legal remedies; he understands the value of religious freedom, and that abandoning religion is best come to through rational discourse. Heck, Dennett cannot even decide whether a world where religion is relegated to quaint hobby status would necessarily be a better one for people’s health & welfare. When the complexity mounts, Dennett is cogent enough to realize he cannot provide sound answers, something the “Ban Islam!” or “Religion is all bad!” Christian purists and reactionary atheists should learn to mimic if they cannot be bothered to read.Along with the aforementioned intellectual comprehensiveness, enough peer-reviewed rigor is infused into Breaking the Spell to make the book warrant the ‘seminal’ label. It functions on a philosophical level (asking questions), an empirical level (observe, study, and compile facts), and a textbook level (delineating cognitive defense mechanisms of religious indoctrination). But what it functions best as is to demand the reader, both atheist and theist, look inside themselves when confronted with a simple question. If you outright react with emotion, best take a moment to figure out why, and try to see if your rationale for your reaction can be backed with evidence, not assertion."
294,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98858055-david-diaz,2,"This book was a waste of time. Dennett has written other stuff that is much better than this one. The main problem is that he lumps all religions together and then tries to explain religion as a natural phenomenon. It’s a fool’s errand to think you can convincingly discuss the drawbacks of ""religion,"" primarily because there is no such thing as a single “religion.” There are hundreds of religions, each with their distinct doctrines, dogma, and sacred texts. Any such discussion has to be laboriously broken down into the parts relevant to that single religion, but Dennett does not do that. He would have been better off titling each chapter: ""Hinduism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Buddhism as a Natural Phenomenon,"" ""Christianity as a Natural Phenomenon,"" etc. In lumping all religions together, he has said nothing about religion per se. To be fair, Dennet provides a disclaimer in the Preface: ""Let me begin with an obvious fact: I am an American author, and this book is addressed in the first place to American readers."" He uses this statement to say that he is focusing the content on ""Christianity first, and Islam and Judaism next."" He concludes: ""I simply do not know enough about other religions to write with any confidence about them."" And yet, he mentions Hinduism six times, Buddhism five times, Taoism twice, Confucianism twice, as well as a smattering of others, notably Talibanism, which he also considers a sect of the religion of Islam. But even if he did limit his discussion to the three monotheistic religions, he would still be at a loss to discuss how each faction or sect under these religions can be seen as a natural phenomenon. The resulting discussion is muddled and uninteresting (at least to me)."
295,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"Pretty disappointing book. It started off decent, hypothesizing some evolutionary origins of religious thought, and the introduction of the concept of memes, which allowed the development and propagation of religious ideas. However, it didn't add much to that. It was more concerned about disproving supernatural claims about religion itself, rather than explaining religion as such. It's a rather understandable endeavor considering how religion is applied for a significant portion of the population. But nevertheless, it's quite pointless for anyone that isn't a religious fundamentalist. If the goal of the book was to convince anyone of the possibility of not being a supernatural God, I don't know why Dennett bothered. His most compelling arguments are borrowed from either Sam Harris or Dawkins, if not quoted directly. He offers nothing original with substantial value. I'm not sure why I expected otherwise, considering it's a rather consistent phenomenon in what some call the ""new atheists"", but it's quite embarrassing writing a book about religion and not understanding it the slightest. In almost 400 pages, Dennet never even touched on anything philosophical ideas behind specific religious stories. His narrow-mindedness can't see anything but literal claims about the material world. It's not super unreasonable considering that is indeed what many religious people claim, but nevertheless, he should know better.If you're looking for the typical atheist case around religion, Dawkins or Sam Harris are much better picks. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of religious thought and origin, then this offers very little insight. "
296,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80687457-jan-goericke,5,"Daniel Dennett wrote a very accessible book on the origin of religion. The first chapters contain detailed discussions on why a scientific research into origin, history, and function of religions are important and valid even, or especially when, conducted by atheist researchers. Dennett discusses in great length the approach his is taking in the book w.r.t. several options to approach the subject. He maintains that this book can only be a starting point for an honest discussion on the role of religions in human life, society, and in our future. He does not expand his research into the psychological origins of religious belief. I had hoped that Dennett's research would tie in to human psychology, and particularly the role religions in overcoming death anxiety, one of the feverishly denied, but doubtlessly strongest motivators of human actions and sociological order.The book contains a detailed and timely discussion on the nonsense currently spewed by conservative leaders that ""only more religion can lead to improved moral in the U.S. society."" An atheistic view obviously does not lead to immoral lifestyles or world views. So, the book is highly recommended to people who have questions on that subject. Although the book is written in an educated and respectful tone, some religious readers might not agree with certain passages. Hence, this book is an excellent test for religious tolerance and willingness to learn. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to more Dennett in my future reading. "
297,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"I wavered between 3 and 2 stars, not because it's so terrible, but because it fails to do what it set out to do - show that religion is a natural phenomenon.Dennett is a philosopher, and claims not to be a biologist. Which is fine. But this book is mostly his philosophical speculations on how religious practices and ideas could come about. He rambles, and meanders; you're never quite sure where he's going or why he just jumped to a new topic. Every now and then is a spark of insight, but hardly anything was backed up by empirical studies.Also, he doesn't understand the religious. Perhaps he's never been a believer. He constantly falls into the trap of assuming that people choose their religion because of what it can offer them. For the most part, I think people choose their religion and stay with it because they think it's true (actually, for the most part, people are born into their religion and stay with it because, at some not insignificant level, they think it's true, probably due to all sorts of cognitive biases and dissonance). Many evangelical Christians don't like the idea of hell, but they think it's what the Bible teaches (it doesn't), and if it's the truth, they just have to accept it (which is how I feel about there being no life after death, as much as I want it).I finished this book wanting to find one that actually does break the spell of religion and explain how it evolved as a natural outcome of human interaction."
298,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This was a challenge. I kept putting it aside after reading a few pages, picking it up and digesting a bit more, until about six years ago when I tucked it in my night stand for what I thought would only be a little while. Well...nearly five years ago we had a fire. This was one of maybe 19-20 books I salvaged out of our 5,800 books in our library that were damaged severely due to smoke and soot. After a couple of years of airing out, I let it sit still longer until I picked it up again last year. I had to start over, having most of the thoughts and memories shoved aside, though I kept my flags and my margin notes were intact.I like Dennett. I think he made a lot of sense, but I also get the sense that this was not as rigorous as his other offerings. Still, I adjusted my perspective on religion years ago because of it (and another book by Pascal Boyer). While I still consider religions and associated beliefs irrational, I have come to an understanding that such is genetically encoded - humans are primed to believe in that which makes no rational sense. That helps me sleep better at night (cliche...I still suck at sleeping) - even if I still don't get it.This is not a ""review"". Just a short observation of something that will take much more thought. I owe Dennett a full review, but I admit I'm not up to it right now."
299,067003472X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,2,"If you have read books on religious belief, atheism and the such, this won't add to you a lot. Yet some innocuous arguments captivated me at the beginning, I was still pondering on why the author kept on extending his arguments without getting directly to the point. Nonetheless, it's a decent introductory book that suggests and encourages the scientific inquiry of religions. Daniel Dennett first lays introductory chapters of his arguments, which, in all seriousness, overstretched, considering that one part (3 to 4 chapters) could've done justice to why scientists shouldn't fret over investigating world's leading religions from a strictly scientific perspective. However, I felt that a great proportion of the book is repeating the same arguments. Too much verbosity and repetition detract this book from becoming a fascinating read. Although the ideas are intrinsically vitally important, there's nothing much to say about them. This book, 11 chapters, could've been reduced to 6 chapters if you edit it. While I admire the premise, I still found it a tedious work to read it. But I recommend this book to those who want a philosophical discussion about religion. However, if you've read, like me, books like the God Delusion, or even watched debates and documentaries about religion you'd most likely be disappointed. "
