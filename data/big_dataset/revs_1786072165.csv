My health was really suffering. It was only when I started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my INSERT NAME OF MADE-UP DIET PLAN HERE and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that’s how my blog was born.""The author debunks detox, alkaline ash, coconut oil, evil sugar, magical coconut oil, paleo, antioxidants, GAPS diet, prepared foods, cancer fighting diets (just a thought, but if someone who makes coffee to drink is called a barista, what is someone who makes coffee to shove up your bum called?) and most of all clean eating and his enemy no. 1,Gwyneth Paltrow & her wellness blog, Goop.If any of these diets or foods resonates with you in any way other than a good way to lose weight whilst feeling morally superior (a bit like people who follow dietary restrictions as part of their religion), then you are going to hate this book. If you are a pragmatist and like things to be science-based then this book will serve as confirmation bias, we all like a bit of that, it never hurts to know that one was right for all these good reasons. What Ben Goldacre did for alternative medicine in Bad Science, Anthony Warner is doing for alternative nutrition. And like Goldacre he is naming names and not getting sued. That should tell you plenty.But we all deep down know what a good, healthy plan is, it's one where you can eat anything in moderation and where you exercise regularly (and get enough sleep). And that's how he concludes this very good book. It's a bonus that he writes well, the only downside is that with me at least he was preaching to the converted and I got bored every now and again. Still a 5 star read though.This is the quote I like best, ""The health and wellness lobby is taking over, relegating the opinions of nutritional scientists, dietitians and public health officials to the sidelines. Their books dominate the best-seller lists, their websites receive millions of hits and their Instagram accounts deliver endless pictures of kale smoothies and quinoa bowls to armies of adoring followers."" (And pictures of just how thin and beautiful they are since being on the diet)."
1,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068686-nabila,2,"I agree with so much of this book and am in complete favour of anything which aims to debunk nonsensical pseudoscience. I think the problems I had with the book were firstly, the angry, shouty style and 'cute' tics of having 'Science Columbo' probably work better in a blog format, in a full length book it becomes repetitive and annoying quite quickly. Another thing I found grating was the constant 'celeb' bashing (one in particular); now, I never thought there would come a day when I would feel compelled to defend this person; and that day has still not arrived, but after a while, the bashing stops being comedic or useful and just becomes mean. The person he discusses so much, is a symptom, not the cause of a lot of this nonsense. Take her out of the equation, another insipid 'celeb' will take her place. I think making her the central baddie as it were, rings hollow. The chapter on eating disorders. Oy vey. That was heavy handed and not particularly well written; apologising for stupid comments you've made in the past about eating disorders does not absolve you of responsibility for the cack handed mess this chapter was. Finally, the chapter on processed food was just...bad. He discloses that he works for a food manufacturer, fair enough. But to have this uneven, 'not all processed food is bad and actually, telling people to cook is like, totally sexist' is reductionist and about as un-nuanced as you can get.I am all for debunking nonsense, especially nonsense that poses as science and whilst I genuinely applaud the effort of this book, the execution is somewhat flawed. And that is a shame because some good quality debunking is very clearly needed in this subject area."
2,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"A thoroughly enjoyable, sweary and important read about the poisonous lies we're fed about food. Warner has some scientific background and a passion for food, and also common sense, and he takes on the Gwyneth Paltrow/paleo/clean eating brigades with gusto, attacking the baselessness and pseudoscience of it all, but also the thinly veiled misogyny and fatphobia that lies behind all this. The first half of the book is basically a high octane rant, which is massive fun. The second half delves into the ways that food pseudoscience leaks into medical treatment--horrific starvation diets and enemas forced on autistic children as a ""cure"", cancer sufferers persuaded to ignore medical treatment in favour of fruit juice, the inescapable links between the shame-fuelled 'clean eating' fad and anorexia/orthorexia. This bit ought to make you extremely angry.A really good, thorough read that digs into the lies we tell ourselves (the concepts of ""confirmation bias"", ""regression to the mean"" and ""correlation is not causation"" ought to be on every school syllabus). Warner thinks we should take pleasure in food, eat a varied diet with occasional treats, and not give other people a hard time about their bodies. It's incredible, and incredibly depressing, that those principles require a lengthy polemic to defend them. "
3,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12067377-laura,1,"Sorry to say this, but I did not like this book at all, I couldn't even get past chapter 6. It's a shame because lots of healthcare professionals and nutritionists were talking it up and promoting it. And I really, really wanted to like this book; the author just made it very difficult for me. There are (some) useful information and good points in there, of course. However, I couldn't find most of them as they are greatly overshadowed by the unappealing style of writing and very strong opinions of the writer that also seem to scare people (the exact idea he is trying to tell people about the fake nutrition experts out there). So while reading the first chapter, I couldn't get out of my head the idea that this person is also not a healthcare professional but a chef and a blogger, so essentially he is doing exactly what he criticizes other 'health' bloggers and writers for doing. Granted, he does debunk several popular nutritional myths, but his points are largely opinion-based and not backed up by enough evidence at all, ""I am not desperately keen to go into every detail of the science here, but in my opinion...""This seems to me another blogger who went into the book industry for the money, as there aren't enough appealing ideas in there to make this book worth a read. This is a book written by a chef, so I don't expect a great deal of scientific analysis in there. Then again, why should I even read this book if it's written by a chef and not a scientist or a health-care professional? Twenty-plus years as a chef does not make you a nutrition expert. And finally I have to say something about this because I did read chapter 19 just to really understand what he was saying. ""Every time we criticize convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" WHAT?!Okay, who said anything about women doing all the cooking? TV dinners, ready-made foods and meals sold in many different stores or restaurants are laden with salt, fats, sugars and a myriad of other ingredients to make them very palatable and shelf-stable until they reach the consumer. 'I am not desperately keen on to go into every detail of the science here', but we certainly shouldn't be relying on these types of convenience foods in our everyday life. We don't mean to be attacking the can of sardines or the iron-fortified cereal types of processed foods. But then, who said anything about women being the ones that have to go to the kitchen to cook? You're a male chef yourself. When we (by 'we' I mean actual nutritionists) advise not to rely on convenience foods and prefer you cook your own foods at home, we mean EVERYONE, not just women. Why ever would you think we mean only women?"
4,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3632255-yoana,4,"I appreciate the debunking of some silly and some openly dangerous myths because who doesn't find magical thinking dressed as science and then preached as gospel annoying? But I especially appreciate the absolutely novel, in my experience, approach to talking about food and health mainly from the point of view of mental health. Food is good, it's more than just fuel, it's a powerful cultural tool we use to derive pleasure, make bonds, understand each other, experience different cultures, explore our differences to find the commonalities between us, and make lasting memories of happy times and loved ones. It's truly cruel how it's been turned into a malicious monster by diet gurus and health bloggers, to be carefully handled, restricted, excluded, maligned as an enemy - and this ultimately harms us all, breaks our relationship with food, deteriorating our quality of life in a palpable way. This angle is the crucial and very significant point and asset of the book that earned it the 4 stars.Apart from that, there's a fair bit of exalted science worshipping, which I've long been wary and weary of, some decidedly narrow-minded prejudice against non-Western cultures, and, most annoying of all, some disingenuous underplaying of proven hazards to health such as pollution, including in food (fish, for example), and meat consumption, so he could make his point more unequivocally. This kind of undermines the sort of trust this kind of book requires to be taken seriously."
5,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32845594-emilia-barnes,4,"I'll be honest - for the first few chapters I wasn't really into this book. That's because those chapters, barring one or two useful insights, were mostly like blog posts about fad diet and idiot lifestyle gurus, and how they're wrong: a fact that most readers of books like this will already know. So it felt sort of like we're patting each other on the back about how clever we are to not fall for such idiot tricks. I only started getting into this book in chapter 12 (A History of Quackery), and it is here that the book should have started, really: with a background of where quackery comes from, because that does more than anything to explain why it is so prevalent today. I know tonnes of people who mistrust government guidelines and doctors, not because they're stupid, but because they're old and because they remember guidelines and recommendations, which turned out to be poisonous. That chapter is followed up by how science works, and why scientific understanding is an evolving thing, which often offers little comfort, as opposed to quack beliefs which are often very strict and clear about rules and about what's good or bad to eat. This, then, would have served as a great second chapter for the book: an outline of his methodological framework, if you will. And it would have supported his actual argument, which, due to the way the book is organised, is kind of lost behind the spiel of ""I'm an angry, ranty guy, who hates dumb idiots."" That's the spiel that's supposed to sell you this book, but it is, in essence, false advertising. This book isn't funny and it isn't fun, and the author, I think, never intended it to be. So, following his outline of where quackery came from, and how the scientific method works (and why there are so many things which we just don't know yet), he could have proceeded to dismantle the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, which at this point would not have looked cruel or mean, but an introduction to his main argument, which follows in the last part of the book: that seemingly innocent quack beliefs, easy to fall for because they offer an illusion of certainty and control over your body and health, have wide-ranging, serious consequences for people and can literally kill. Anyway, I might be too academic in my review of this book, but it would have, I think, strengthened his argument. In truth, the first few chapters, when he rants about alkaline ash and gluten free etc, undermine him later on, because they make you think: dude, you're a chef. It's like a painter writing a book about the health consequences of plastic surgery. But in fact he's very good at signalling to you where scientific consensus or fact ends and his opinion begins. He sources his claims, so you can check them for yourself anyway, which is always a good idea. So it's clear that he is serious about his message, and wants you to take it seriously too. Which is why I think his publisher did him a disservice by putting on the cover reviews that stress how ""funny"" this book is, and putting knives on the cover, signalling this will be a brutal take down by an angry, angry man. The best parts of this book aren't angry at all, but heartfelt, compassionate, worried but understanding. And there's little to laugh at when he explains how vulnerable people are being victimised by our refusal to accept science (despite its weaknesses and faults) as the only safe arbiter of what is healthy and what isn't. Anyway, despite my criticism, it is an interesting and worthwhile read for everyone. If you're prone to fall for the glossy image of perfect lives lived by the ""clean eating"" crowd, this book is for you. If you're ill and confused about the myriad of advice given you by well-meaning people, crowding out your doctor's advice, this book is for you. And if you, like me, avoid any and all news about food, weight-loss and health in newspapers and magazines, because you know the opposite will be claimed a week later somewhere else, this book is also for you."

As a food teacher, I’ve long believed the wisdom held within but never had the nerve to stand up against the trash in the media. Read this, it will seriously open your eyes, and do so in a hugely entertaining manner. It has profanity too!I’ll leave you with this little piece of wisdom...“Put down that superfood smoothie, ditch your wellness books, close that clean-eating web page and delete it from your history. Unfollow the wellness gurus who encourage you to abandon the tenets of scientific reason. It might seem harmless today, but sometime in the future when your options are not so bright, it may cost you more than you can afford.”Oh. And eat more fish. "

8,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55133642-julia-jakobsen,2,"Very much in the vein of Ben Goldacre, The Angry Chef sets out to debunk clean eating myths and bad food science. It's a very interesting topic but unfortunately it comes across as jumbled and badly written. Too anecdotal and not enough research to back up some pretty wild statements (like how women were freed from the shackles of the kitchen by convenience foods and railing against homemade food), maybe it will be popular with teenagers in the throes of clean eating blogs and health food propaganda (What The Health, anyone?). I think I've read better books about this subject. Also I'm not a fan of his personal bashing of celebrities, it's mean spirited an doesn't contribute anything to the point of the book. "
9,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15098335-claire-kane,5,"Something in me wants to print this out and it out to everyone who thinks Gluten is bad for them, that potatoes are somehow not good for you and so on. I love debunking nutritional nonsense and as a long time sufferer of eating disorders nothing pisses me off more than someone demonising certain foods. I love this book and I recommend to everyone! a must read."
10,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“When modern medicine has little to offer, one of the few things people can control is their food. As their illness progresses and they start to feel worse, they will look for any intervention that might help. Many will find advice from alternative practitioners or the internet, often telling them to exclude certain things from their diet.”Warner, and his learned cohorts, like Goldacre’s “Bad Science” and Ernst & Singh’s “Trick Or Treatment” try to take a sobering and practical look at some of the worrying nonsense being pedalled out there in the celebrity diet community. He makes some great points about how food and dietary choices are so often used to assert class and superiority. Just listen to some people talk about coffee and wine. He brings a bold and pragmatic approach that is an ideal tonic for the wall of waffle we get from pseudoscience.He shows how people so often confuse hypothesis with theory and the problems that can lead to. Detox, Anti-oxidants, the alkaline ash diet, the paleo diet, clean eating and GAPS all come in for some well-earned criticism. Gwyneth Paltrow, (who comes across like a maniac with a keyboard) also falls between the crosshairs. He doesn't hold back on his opinions to diet or food, his thoughts on coconut oil as a super food were very amusing, “A small, obscure culinary fat with very limited use” that “makes everything taste like sun cream”. Warner reveals the generic template that so many of these diet gurus churn out, which did make me laugh aloud in recognition. He even makes up his own diet to see if it will be adopted by gullible readers. He goes onto explain many more concepts like regression to the mean and placebos, like Goldacre did in “Bad Science”. There is a jokey light hearted approach with no lack of a naughty word or two in there, but he also tackles some very serious subjects too, not least some heart breaking cases of terminal cancer, that really hit home the seriousness of his point.There was one argument that I was largely unconvinced by and that was the chapter on sugar. He appears to have lumped all sugars in together, as if sugars derived from fruit were in the same league as refined, white sugar, which I found a bit misleading. We obviously need sugar, but the problem is with refined and hidden sugars, which I think he could have expanded on. He is correct in saying that the obesity epidemic is more than just about sugar, but as he himself even agrees there is enough strong evidence to show the damage caused by refined sugar, “Although the United States did see a per capita increase, and sugar consumption there shows a strong correlation to obesity levels.”He suggests that big sugar is not as influential as it is being made out to be, “We will have to be so powerful we can persuade the nutritional establishment to spend millions of dollars producing fake science to justify these new dietary guidelines. We will then have to bribe every level of government to enforce these guidelines on an unsuspecting public.” He goes onto say, “Which part of the food industry do you think has the most power, money and influence-sugar manufacturers, or the combined weight of the meat, dairy and culinary oil businesses.”But you don’t need millions of dollars. In 2016 it was revealed that Harvard professors had taken money to manipulate their findings to favour the sugar industry. As the New York Times said, “The documents show that a trade group called the Sugar Research Foundation, known today as the Sugar Association, paid three Harvard scientists the equivalent of about $50,000 in today’s dollars to publish a 1967 review of research on sugar, fat and heart disease. The studies used in the review were handpicked by the sugar group, and the article which was published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, minimized the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspersions on the role of saturated fat.”As well as that it is worth noting that one sugar company alone, Nestle, enjoyed a revenue in 2012 that was larger than the GDP of all but seventy of the world’s nations, so there is little question of the power and influence of these brands. They don’t need to be stronger or even as powerful as these industries. They are not necessarily competing against each other, and they don’t have to, both are more interested in minimising regulation, and maximising profit than fighting each other. I thought he was incredibly naïve in his thinking that governments wouldn’t allow something into the market that wasn’t good for us. He greatly underestimates the phenomenal power and influence that the lobbyists of these multi-billion conglomerates employ. Taking the US as an example, look at their record on regulating guns, caffeine, big pharma, big oil, to mention only a few areas. If they can’t change gun laws when massacre after massacre occurs what makes you think that they would be any different towards sugar?...More importantly remember that big tobacco claimed for decades to have health benefits in moderation, using images of babies, Santa and it was endorsed by athletes, and doctors in the US who publicly advocated the health benefits of smoking. They were doing this for years and this was still happening in the second half of the 20th century. These are not the rantings of conspiracy theorists, or paranoid extremists. These are highly educated people with power and influence.The sugar defence really didn’t make sense until the final third of the book, when I came across this quote, “In the interests of transparency, I have to admit vested interests at this point” I thought that page 271 was maybe a little late to reveal them, but better late than never. “I have spent over ten years working as a development chef in the food manufacturing industry, creating recipes for value added convenience products for a number of well-known food brands.” For whatever reason his interests of transparency stop at naming any of the brands by name, so I will go out on a limb and guess that maybe ‘value added convenience products’ is some corporate Orwellian euphemism for ready meals, stuff that you cook in the microwave. If so, why not just say that?...I am sure you will be aware that these products traditionally rely on a lot of added sugar, salt and other filler, so this may explain why he is so reluctant to speak out against sugar and ready meals. I agree with him about the important role that convenience foods play in countless people’s lives. Surely only idiots would wish to outlaw them. But again it’s a question of framing. The problem isn’t convenience foods, the problem is the dubious claims of 'health benefits' and of course the hidden sugar, salt and other crap buried away in them. The sheer abundance of it in everyday items and how hard it is to avoid them, especially if you are on a limited income. What is needed is more education, stricter regulation on what you are allowed to put in them, and more transparency and responsibility from the companies who persist to design deliberately misleading labels.Please understand that is merely a minor gripe, and that overall this was an otherwise excellently researched, at times amusing and enjoyable two fingers up to the celebrity laden, charlatan crowded mad world of fad diets, non-science and snake oil. Warner and his team have done a great job of bringing these dangers, fallacies, myths and lies into the mainstream and exposing them for what they are. Their concerted efforts will help to stop so many trusting, vulnerable and desperate people from being hurt, fleeced or worse in the future, and for that Warner and his cohorts should be applauded."
11,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57315908-mart-roben,5,"This book is like a finely cooked dish, with many layers of enjoyment. The main theme is scientific evidence (or lack thereof) for benefits of various food fads. In addition to raw facts, it explores the origins and psychology of persistent culinary nonsense. Elegant cussing and imaginary dialogues are also among the aforementioned layers.It’s no wonder pseudoscientific eating advice is so common - in a twisted way, bullshit diets often appear to work. The Angry Chef suggests several explanations:* Instead of following a steady line, our feeling of healthiness randomly fluctuates in time. People are more likely to take action when they’re at worse. The improvement that follows is not due to the miracle diet, but a regression to mean (what goes down must come up).* Despite claiming to have more energy, shinier skin, etc., the main instrument used to measure diet’s effectiveness is bathroom scales. Not surprisingly, every fad diet can result in weight loss because of their restrictive nature. However, weight loss doesn’t automatically signify healthy.* Dieting is boring. Using memes like cleanness, detox, alkalinity etc. makes it a game and helps participants stick to their routine. Exotic ingredients and secret recipes function as status signals in the community.* Lot of symptoms that detox diets claim to soothe are the same as symptoms of depression. Adopting a new diet and having something to focus on might actually pacify a troubled mind.I also liked the discussion about processed convenience foods. Yes, they might not be as healthy as kale from granny’s backyard. But in a way, they’ve liberated a generation of people (especially women) to pursue other things in life. If food is your passion, go for three home-cooked meals a day. But many would trade a few years in life expectancy for not having to spend the time and cognitive effort on something they have no interest in.Moreover, “processed” doesn’t automatically mean bad. We all drink processed water - it’s perhaps the greatest life-saving innovation of humanity. Demonising the food industry and demanding scientifically nonsensical products (gluten-free, sugar-free…) goes against the progress that healthy eating movement aims to spark.As a bittersweet after-note, you may be disappointed to find that the book has no recipes of scientifically proven healthy dishes. We just don’t know enough about the matter yet. The most that science can tell us right now is that the tens of thousands of chemical substances that we ingest every day as food act together in miraculous and poorly understood combination. It is our job to live with this uncertainty and try to make reasonable judgements anyway. A rational healthy eater should “eat everything in moderation and move around more.”"
12,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1434635-terzah,5,"The title flags a truth not often recognized in Boulder County, CO, where I live: there is a LOT of bullshit in the world of food. And the many faces of that bullshit, plus their antecedents (ayurveda, etc.), are all spelled out in this book: Paleo, gluten-free-for-non-celiacs, detoxing, ""clean"" eating. Many of these eating protocols are built on a grain of truth (ha! get it? ""grain"" of truth!), but have spun way out of control, to the point that the author argues they foster disordered eating, mislead people (sometimes tragically) with regard to food's influence on diseases like cancer, and lead to anorexia and other true diet-related mental and physical illnesses. Warner places such diets in the context of the general contempt that many people, looking for easy answers, have for the complicated, decidedly non-simplistic and hard-to-apply process of science. It's the same anti-science bias you see regarding climate change, and it's just as alarming in the realm of nutrition.I wasn't familiar with Warner's blog (The Angry Chef), but when I spotted this book on the new bookshelf at my library, I was fresh off the experience of a ""detox"" that many friends who are not dumb people have done and touted for its great effects on their sleep quality, clarity of thinking and in some cases their weight. I haven't been able to run as much in the last few months because of an injury, and I've gained weight--and that's on top of the general hectic nature of my life, which doesn't allow for good sleep, a lot of downtime to decompress or much time to plan healthy meals. I'm feeling soft in the middle and weak and tired these days. The prospect of a two-week protocol that promised to fix all these issues (and have a positive effect on my skin and hair too!) caught me at vulnerable moment.It didn't work, of course--it just made me more tired and stressed because I had to plan special meals and drink green smoothies, and my sleep and weight and hair quality stayed exactly the same. And this has been my experience in general with eating protocols. I've (fortunately) never been truly tempted by Paleo or keto or gluten-free diets, which promise equally dramatic results as long as you stay on them....forever; I've never done well with ""forever"" when it comes to eating restrictions, and I think that's a good thing. But like many people I'm frustrated with the never-ending fight against the first-world problem of creeping weight gain and the mixed messages coming at us from all sides about how to combat it. The media, celebrities (though I try to ignore them) and my friends (who as I said above aren't stupid and in most contexts don't fall for scams but as health-conscious people are susceptible to dubious messages about eating) all have opinions on this and, it often seems, certainty about what will work. At my most downcast, I too can be easy prey for the siren song of clean eating.The Angry Chef's message is freeing. He hates the moralistic language around food: ""clean"" vs. ""dirty"" in particular. His scientific arguments against strict food rules and his clear explanation of WHY nutrition is complicated set you free to enjoy what you want to--even, gasp, some processed food (yay Oreos)--in moderation. I also found his mocking of celebrity health gurus like Gwyneth Paltrow hilarious and spot-on (I've often wondered who died and made her queen of nutrition; it's really easy to eat well when you are a wealthy actress, and it's also easy to have great skin and hair that way). Likewise his calling out of the weird obsessions that go along with some of these programs: enemas? really? for a healthy person?! no, thanks; such a dwelling on poop among these folks!! I also found his honesty refreshing and common-sensical: there are no easy answers. Much of this foolishness is just the Western preoccupation with being thin disguised as a quest to be healthy. Those two things aren't necessarily the same, and it's dishonest and damaging to conflate them.The only thing I'd quibble with in this book is that while Warner rightly emphasizes the dangers of food pseudoscience for people suffering from scary illnesses like cancer as well as for all of us reasonably healthy people needlessly falling prey to its siren song of ""getting the glow"" and ""our best body,"" and while it's true that we are all too worried about being thin, obesity also is a real health problem. Warner says we are wrong to blame the food industry and processed food for the obesity epidemic....and he may be right about that. But WHY, then, has it become such an issue? Being lean isn't just cosmetic. In most cases, the leaner a person is, the healthier they are too. Fat-shaming is horrible, and making people think they can escape the middle-aged spread by depriving themselves of the pleasure of food is also counterproductive....but weight gain is an actual health problem that needs to be dealt with. My parents--my direct genetic forebears--were in their youth much leaner on their pre-processed-foods 1950s and 1960s diets than I was at the same age in the 1980s and 1990s, when fast food and processed food hit their peak. It doesn't seem that far-fetched that this is more than just correlation implying a false causation.But this is just a minor quibble with the important message of this book. As the Angry Chef himself would say, it's complicated. I can live with complication. To lose my extra pounds, I'm going to try to get more sleep, eat more veggies without giving up the occasional indulgence and ramp my running up as my injury allows. It's not easy and there's no real protocol for it, but nothing worthwhile or true is easy. I'm really glad I read this book."

14,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10325257-libby,3,"5 stars for readability5 stars for his effusive love of food (which I share)5 stars for making me think about many things in ways I had not thought about before5 stars for his ideas about how science should be taught - not just as hard facts but also as a way of life - of thinking critically about the world, dealing with uncertainty and realizing how much we don’t knowHowever, I’ve got one sticking point with this book which is making it difficult for me to rate it overall - I don’t think he gets all of the story in. Eg towards the end he says that fussy eating can be a symptom of depression and that those people should really go to doctors to get help because that will save them... as someone with a chronic illness (endometriosis) whose symptoms are controlled quite well by food on top of conventional medicine (and my diet is extremely varied even though I limit my intake of certain foods) I don’t think he stresses enough how much conventional medicine does not have the answer for every ill, particularly for something as complex as depression or anxiety. Drugs don’t work well for everyone and they can have really horrible side effects that doctors dismiss and expect you to live with. He does mention medicine’s shortcomings at times in the book but then his aforementioned comments make me think that he doesn’t realize how much food can really affect people’s well-being and how it can be used as a tool for good in a healthy non-guilt-inducing way. I think mentioning the gut-brain connection would’ve helped (maybe he mentioned it and I forgot? Either way his comments on depression seem too simplistic).Also he seems to ignore the fact that even though we are at a really good time in the world’s history in terms of having access to clean water/vaccines/antibiotics/etc, there are also a lot of new chemicals that we are producing that we don’t really know the effects of yet (or the ones which we’ve done studies on don’t look great so far). Dioxins for example are far more common than they used to be and exposure to it has been show to increase the risk of endometriosis (among many other conditions).Also, saying that convenience food has helped women progress in the world and that getting rid of it would relegate women back to the kitchen again... that shouldn't be the case. Maybe realistically that is what would happen but men are responsible for cooking too, so that shouldn't be an argument pro-convenience food.Disclaimer: I am a scientist so I tend to not accept stuff that I read straight away so that’s part of why he’s getting a bit of a hard time - overall I think it is enjoyable and very much a worthwhile read."

There really is so much nonsense floating around about fad diets and cleanses and superfoods that it was quite refreshing to read something that debunked all the nonsense and steered by actual scientific evidence and common sense. (However, there was not nearly as much profanity or actual amusing ranting as expected - it's all very civil, really. I'll assume he saves the expletives for his blog.)I wish I could say this book will be useful as a basis for initiating conversations with the dietetically obsessed in order to contribute to Warner's fight against ""nutribollocks"", but it is sadly true - as the book does point out - that too many people consider even hard evidence a matter of opinion and prefer to cling to simplistic pseudoscience and anecdotal evidence instead.

True believers in any of those cure-all diets will not enjoy this book. Nor will Gwenyth Paltrow or the real-life model for the two guys called ""Jamie"" and ""Oliver.""It's sweary / quite raw in places, but honestly that's a strength. Other strengths: The chapter on Easter bunnies and correlation vs. causation and the discussion of the power of social media to help absolute quacks and frauds seem authentic. The factual content itself is worth between five and eleventy-nine stars.The writing's a little uneven. Many books based on blogs (and Mr. Angry Chef started out as a blogger) are essentially strings of blog posts disguised as chapters with a little filler. Angry (do you mind if I call you Angry? Mr. Chef seems so formal) has written extensive content outside of the blog format and it doesn't work all that well. The conclusion is a bit preachy and it has almost as many false endings as the third Lord of the Rings movie.The other problem with the book is who to recommend it to. I know several people who are true believers in one diet or another, and I can't imagine it will do my friendships any good to say ""Here, read this ... the author proves pretty conclusively that the diet you've built your whole world view around is utter bullsh*t."""

Other ideas I had were more or less confirmed, like the (fairly logical) one that any diet which completely restricts some kind of food, like sugar or flour or fat, a) will lead to some initial weight loss and b) will not be not very balanced, will it? I also found his thoughts about how the real problem with many ""food fads"" is underlying guilt and shame very powerful. So, recommended if you always had a bad feeling about those Instagrammers with their bowls of kale and quinoa, or if you want you discussion with your mother about homeopathy to be much more interesting next time.

Split up into different chapters and sprinkled with humour, this was a really interesting and fun read. He debunks a lot of myths sold to us on a daily basis (detoxing IS NOT A THING), and investigates the darker side of some advertising - the way companies and organisations deliberately target vulnerable people by using dirty tricks designed to cause fear and hysteria in order to peddle some juice or tea.

22,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36459924-irene,4,"The Angry Chef’s Guide debunks pseudoscience in mainstream media and makes the convincing argument that pseudoscience is not harmless as you may think, but a gateway for dangerous beliefs such as anti-vaccination and naturopathic cures for cancer. The Angry Chef’s Guide champions the scientific method and passionately argues for the liberation of science from a list of facts to memorize in high school but to accept and surrender to science as the constant questioning of life and to live comfortably with uncertainty.We must be  “taught to think, but also be taught how we think”  and remember science is about not knowing as much as it is to question. To be a scientific thinker means to catch ourselves before we conclude correlation is causation and to take anecdotes as hard evidence  “because it sounded correct and [we] had believed it in the past. It did not matter that [we] could not remember why [we] knew it or where [we] had heard it first.” A chef by trade, Anthony Warner began the Angry Chef blog because he was angry by Paltrow Science and nutritionists frolicking around. This is the first book in the series, and Warner’s intent is to educate the reader to think for themselves so that they are not scammed by the latest diet crazy spouted by nutritionists that have no scientific training. While the majority of us know pseudoscience is a marketing smokescreen, we may believe it’s harmless because we’re just trying it out. Everyone else is doing it. At the very least, we might lose a few pounds. But the impact of letting bygones be bygones is letting those that are most vulnerable fall through the cracks. From pursuing questionable alternative treatments for autistic children that result in enemas for 2-year-olds or taking on restrictive diets as an alternative treatment to cure cancer, many people die when they could have been saved or die living the rest of their few years in misery. And for what? Warner deeply loves food and he is angry at those that pervert food, that either use food to signify status or use food to purify themselves - those that distort science to sell whatever they want - but he also feels for the victims that get sucked in and ultimately lose big for betting on the wrong horse.Warner also does a convincing job of showing everyone’s skin in the game: Why do we believe in the lies? Who are more susceptible to falling for them and falling for them in ways that may lead them to destroy their lives? What structures are in place to distort scientific research? How much of a role does media play and how much are scientists themselves at fault for this distortion of research? Warner believes the secret to healthy eating is to eat lots of different stuff, not too much or too little and not to feel guilty about it because  “the real science behind food is still driven by a lot of uncertainty as to how our diet affects our health.”  He believes in the Mediterranean diet. Fair enough.But I found a fatal failing in The Angry Chef for how it portrayed Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine, dismissing it under straw man arguments and blanket statements, out of his distaste for anything New Age and mystical. To immediately dismiss rich civilizations because of its popularity among New Age types and its “ancient” perceptions was a sweeping conclusion, and incredibly reductive. By equating these two ancient disciplines on the same level as moon dust is simply insulting. Warner also tries hard to argue that everything is pretty good in the food industry, considering it used to be way worse! Did the food industry pay him to say that? Of course, it is just like everything else about society. Race, social mobility etc. and just like these issues of our times - the simple fact that we've made progress doesn't mean the work is done. The food industry desperately needs reform when it comes to traceability in the supply chain in order to reduce foodborne illness outbreaks. Overall, a highly powerful and instructive read. A great plea for us to be critical and fight back against anyone who thinks they know the secret to eating right and healthy."
23,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34367827-leigh-anne,5,"Read it and weep for humanity. Then cheer for science.Science is complicated and messy. Unfortunately, that doesn't line up really well with what the human brain demands of its nutrition information. We just want to know what five things to eat, what five things to avoid, and how we can never get cancer again. Sadly, there are a lot of books out there that cater to this desire for simplification, and most of them are bullshit. Thankfully, the Angry Chef is here to explain why, using the principles of the scientific method.I have only ONE problem with this book, and I'm going to mention it up front because the author didn't: Warner's career has been primarily as an INDUSTRIAL chef, which means that of COURSE he's pissed at the people who turn up their nose at processed food: he's spent his entire career trying to make it healthier and tastier. However, he should have mentioned that right up front, as opposed to waiting until the reader is deep into the book and already thoroughly on his side. It felt a BIT disingenuous, and is VERY disappointing coming from someone who has otherwise behaved ethically and excellently while writing. He may have surmised that some readers would not hear him out if they knew his professional ties up front; however, ethically, he should've revealed them right out of the gate.Luckily, this is no reason to call shenanigans on his takedowns of the paleo diet, coconut oil, the relationship between sugar and cancer, and ""clean eating,"" to name but a few. With his dry British wit and some very creative analogies, Warner explains how food science works and why it's so easy to fall for nonsense. He walks you through the tells of pseudoscience, taking many, many potshots at Gwyneth Paltrow along the way (I personally found this hysterical, but YMMV). My favorite chapters were on the GAPS diet (which is DANGEROUS for children, does NOT ""cure"" autism, and BTW, autism isn't something that needs a ""cure"" anyway, kthxbai) and eating disorders, for which many, many diets are simply a good excuse for anorexics and orthorexics to restrict foods (seriously, if you have an ED, please read this book and discuss it with your doctor). Chances are you're either intrigued, or royally pissed because this book skewers one (or more) of your sacred cows. Hopefully this will drive you to read it and discuss it with everybody you know. Ideally, you too will become a Science Columbo and learn to question every claim about food that sounds too good to be true. Mandatory for all public library collections, to counter-balance the carloads of crap diet books you have to buy for demand. "
24,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46082669-julia,4,"I was a follower of the Angry Chef’s blog before this book came about, and I admit I came into reading this knowing I would broadly agree with its conclusions: I want the public to better understand science and evidence, I hate “nutribollocks,” I find “wellness gurus” and people who get sanctimonious and obsessive about what they eat to be tremendous bores, and I love gluten. So it’s unsurprising that this book largely satisfied me even though it wasn’t necessarily news to me. It feels like the successor to Dr Ben Goldacre’s “Bad Science” from about a decade ago. If you want to know more about how to better fight pseudoscience, that remains the essential read.Of course, this book’s utility comes not in preaching to the converted but to teaching people who have fallen for trendy garbage that they can stop worrying and eat what you like. I’m not sure if it will be quite as successful in that regard, but Warner remains respectful of his readers and not too venomous,!which is important.At times the book seemed to go on a little too long, but then when you get to the end of the chapter on how quacks who insist you can cure cancer with natural food diets and coffee enemas have sent people to early graves, you want to paint some of his lines on the sides of buildings: “The end point of that stupid, pointless detox salad you choose for lunch lies here. It is people claiming they can cure deadly disease with carrot juice and enemas. It is clinics extorting the life savings of the dying...Unfollow the wellness gurus who encourage you to abandon the tenets of scientific reason. It might seem harmless today, but sometime in the future when your options are not so bright, it may cost you more than you can afford.”"

It's clear, even in the writers own words, that he is seeking some 'shock tactics' to get this content out into the public domain, fighting the tide of celebrity bloggers with limited credentials who are flogging 'clean eating' and other unhelpful plans that feed into disordered eating behaviours. Underneath the humour and occasional strong language there's evidence of a decent amount of research, repackaged for a general audience. On occasion it feels like he's having too much of a bash at G Paltrow, but much of the rest is an interesting collection of insights into a range of diets - highlighting why many of them SEEM to make sense, then demonstrating how they don't. There's a constant emphasis that correlation and causation are not necessarily the same thing, and that the plural of anecdote is not evidence. "

Fad diets and food myths that fall under his knife include the paleo diet, the antioxidant cure, and the toxicity of sugar.

It is interesting to discover that many of the food ideas we hold really have no scientific basis and are even based on totally mistaken ideas of a small scientific fact, like what paleo people ate, are the core on which many people base their food choices. Chef Warner looks at several ""mainstream"" food ideas about eating and debunks them with scientific facts. The more restrictive the diet is with rules of what not to eat, the more likely it is to be nonscientific. He also has a list of 10 guidelines to spotting food nonsense (BS) including that they will be very certain that only their way is the only way.

I learned not only about toxic cleanses, acid/alkaline based diets, and gluten-free but also about what anti-oxidants and free radicals really mean, the relationship between food and illness, and why Gwyneth Paltrow is the devil.This book may not appeal to everyone but I always enjoy a good rant, especially when it makes me think.

The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "

Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams.

However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."

It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
44,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "
45,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368999-jessica,4,"Why does chef Anthony Warner go by ""the angry chef""? He's tired of food bullsh*t and pseudoscience masquerading as truth and fact. In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

46,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
47,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
48,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
49,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
50,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
51,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
52,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
53,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"
54,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,4,"I didn't like so much the ""blog way"" of the author to convey a lot of useful information and tips to identify and destroy the pseudoscientist' theories and their faith in whatever is in fashion at this moment (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). Avrei anche preferito un approccio piú scientifico nella demistificazione delle idiozie correnti, ma se questo linguaggio rende il libro piú leggibile, ben venga. "
55,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51440612-kateking58,3,"Admitedly, the blog is more entertaining (i.e. more sweary) but I suppose that being taken seriously as an author requires more gravitas in writing.There are important messages in this book, about how needlessly limiting what you eat simply because someone with good PR and glossy hair spins a tale that seems superficially plausible is a bad idea. The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC. I look forward to reading The Angry Chef's thoughts on the programme."

It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "
57,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007226-johanne,5,"Read this book. It is a really excellent look at the realities of food and nutrition, it is also funny and informative. A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ?

Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
59,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!

The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."

The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "

Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"

However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."
70,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48742628-krish,4,"""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men are full of doubts"" - Bertrand Russell Eating well is about pleasure, balance and the creation of memories. It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

Not just for the information, which, without further research, I could never say is 100% correct, but in the way he totally changed my mindset regarding food, nutrition, and the proliferation of pseudoscience in the internet age. It's at least disappointing and at worst despicable how many sham diets and quack ""professionals"" there are who will take advantage of people in bad circumstances (cancer, diabetes, depression, etc.) and tell them ""well if you cut out carbs you'll be cured!"" The Angry Chef is a lover of food and a lover of people, and I'm glad he's fighting this fight. "

Toxins, clean eating, raw food, paleo, the peril of gluten- things I’ve wanted to shake educated, rational, decent people for believing & repeating- it’s all challenged here, with swearing & science, my two favourite things. Hooray! "
73,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
74,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "
75,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368999-jessica,4,"Why does chef Anthony Warner go by ""the angry chef""? He's tired of food bullsh*t and pseudoscience masquerading as truth and fact. In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

76,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
77,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
78,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
79,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
80,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
81,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."

Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
83,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"

I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.).

The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC.

It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "

A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ?

Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
89,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!

In fact, I don't even care anymore)) After finishing this book I got this feeling we experience when being kids. When we don't yet know about skinny being sexy, pastries ruining our shapes, diets, ""superfoods"" and all that jazz. When we simply enjoy what we do and eat. When we don't obsess and overthink.

At times very funny and enjoyable, this is also a very informative read that gives a proper explanation of what science is and how this applies to the world of food and eating. The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."

The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "

Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"
99,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52737534-callum-soukup-croy,3,"Warner writes in two voices on occasion, as his self and his instinctive brain. However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."

It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

Not just for the information, which, without further research, I could never say is 100% correct, but in the way he totally changed my mindset regarding food, nutrition, and the proliferation of pseudoscience in the internet age. It's at least disappointing and at worst despicable how many sham diets and quack ""professionals"" there are who will take advantage of people in bad circumstances (cancer, diabetes, depression, etc.) and tell them ""well if you cut out carbs you'll be cured!""

Toxins, clean eating, raw food, paleo, the peril of gluten- things I’ve wanted to shake educated, rational, decent people for believing & repeating- it’s all challenged here, with swearing & science, my two favourite things. Hooray! "
103,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
104,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "

In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

106,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
107,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
108,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
109,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
110,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
111,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
112,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
113,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"
114,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,4,"I didn't like so much the ""blog way"" of the author to convey a lot of useful information and tips to identify and destroy the pseudoscientist' theories and their faith in whatever is in fashion at this moment (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). Avrei anche preferito un approccio piú scientifico nella demistificazione delle idiozie correnti, ma se questo linguaggio rende il libro piú leggibile, ben venga. "
115,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51440612-kateking58,3,"Admitedly, the blog is more entertaining (i.e. more sweary) but I suppose that being taken seriously as an author requires more gravitas in writing.There are important messages in this book, about how needlessly limiting what you eat simply because someone with good PR and glossy hair spins a tale that seems superficially plausible is a bad idea. The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC. I look forward to reading The Angry Chef's thoughts on the programme."
116,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22611105-chelsea-harrop,4,"This is a very funny and honest book that confronts a lot of the bullshit surrounding food. It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "
117,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007226-johanne,5,"Read this book. It is a really excellent look at the realities of food and nutrition, it is also funny and informative. A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ? Correlation is not causation"

Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
119,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!

In fact, I don't even care anymore)) After finishing this book I got this feeling we experience when being kids. When we don't yet know about skinny being sexy, pastries ruining our shapes, diets, ""superfoods"" and all that jazz. When we simply enjoy what we do and eat. When we don't obsess and overthink. And I feel grateful for getting to experience it, again. "

At times very funny and enjoyable, this is also a very informative read that gives a proper explanation of what science is and how this applies to the world of food and eating. The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."
127,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8941478-carl-phillips,5,"A book that needed to be written given the proliferation of idiocy that exists today in the world in the name of dieting and healthy eating. The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "

Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"
129,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52737534-callum-soukup-croy,3,"Warner writes in two voices on occasion, as his self and his instinctive brain. However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."

It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

It's at least disappointing and at worst despicable how many sham diets and quack ""professionals"" there are who will take advantage of people in bad circumstances (cancer, diabetes, depression, etc.) and tell them ""well if you cut out carbs you'll be cured!"" The Angry Chef is a lover of food and a lover of people, and I'm glad he's fighting this fight. "
132,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5145798-b,5,"What a wonderful, important book. The silly things we’ve come to believe about food, and why we believe them. Toxins, clean eating, raw food, paleo, the peril of gluten- things I’ve wanted to shake educated, rational, decent people for believing & repeating- it’s all challenged here, with swearing & science, my two favourite things. Hooray! "
133,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
134,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "

In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

136,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
137,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
138,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
139,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
140,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
141,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
142,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
143,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"
144,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,4,"I didn't like so much the ""blog way"" of the author to convey a lot of useful information and tips to identify and destroy the pseudoscientist' theories and their faith in whatever is in fashion at this moment (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). Avrei anche preferito un approccio piú scientifico nella demistificazione delle idiozie correnti, ma se questo linguaggio rende il libro piú leggibile, ben venga. "

The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC. I look forward to reading The Angry Chef's thoughts on the programme."

It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "

A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ?

Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
149,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really.

In fact, I don't even care anymore)) After finishing this book I got this feeling we experience when being kids. When we don't yet know about skinny being sexy, pastries ruining our shapes, diets, ""superfoods"" and all that jazz. When we simply enjoy what we do and eat. When we don't obsess and overthink. And I feel grateful for getting to experience it, again. "
156,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22628957-greencoffeepot,5,"This is a brilliant book, everyone that has ever considered any sort of diet, restricted eating or 'clean eating' should read this. At times very funny and enjoyable, this is also a very informative read that gives a proper explanation of what science is and how this applies to the world of food and eating. The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."
157,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8941478-carl-phillips,5,"A book that needed to be written given the proliferation of idiocy that exists today in the world in the name of dieting and healthy eating. The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "
158,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23974131-tom-donaghey,5,"	THE ANGRY CHEF: Bad Science and The Truth About Healthy Eating by Chef Anthony Warner is just what the title says it is. Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"
159,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52737534-callum-soukup-croy,3,"Warner writes in two voices on occasion, as his self and his instinctive brain. However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."
160,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48742628-krish,4,"""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men are full of doubts"" - Bertrand Russell Eating well is about pleasure, balance and the creation of memories. It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

Not just for the information, which, without further research, I could never say is 100% correct, but in the way he totally changed my mindset regarding food, nutrition, and the proliferation of pseudoscience in the internet age. It's at least disappointing and at worst despicable how many sham diets and quack ""professionals"" there are who will take advantage of people in bad circumstances (cancer, diabetes, depression, etc.) and tell them ""well if you cut out carbs you'll be cured!"" The Angry Chef is a lover of food and a lover of people, and I'm glad he's fighting this fight. "
162,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5145798-b,5,"What a wonderful, important book. The silly things we’ve come to believe about food, and why we believe them. Toxins, clean eating, raw food, paleo, the peril of gluten- things I’ve wanted to shake educated, rational, decent people for believing & repeating- it’s all challenged here, with swearing & science, my two favourite things. Hooray! "
163,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
164,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "
165,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368999-jessica,4,"Why does chef Anthony Warner go by ""the angry chef""? He's tired of food bullsh*t and pseudoscience masquerading as truth and fact. In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

166,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
167,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
168,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
169,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."

Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
171,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
172,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
173,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"

I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.).

The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC.

It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "

A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ?

Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
179,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!

In fact, I don't even care anymore)) After finishing this book I got this feeling we experience when being kids. When we don't yet know about skinny being sexy, pastries ruining our shapes, diets, ""superfoods"" and all that jazz. When we simply enjoy what we do and eat. When we don't obsess and overthink.

At times very funny and enjoyable, this is also a very informative read that gives a proper explanation of what science is and how this applies to the world of food and eating. The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."

The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "

Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"
189,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52737534-callum-soukup-croy,3,"Warner writes in two voices on occasion, as his self and his instinctive brain. However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."
190,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48742628-krish,4,"""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men are full of doubts"" - Bertrand Russell Eating well is about pleasure, balance and the creation of memories. It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

Hooray! "
193,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
194,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "

In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good.

It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated.

Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

196,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
197,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
198,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
199,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
200,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
201,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
202,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
203,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"
204,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,4,"I didn't like so much the ""blog way"" of the author to convey a lot of useful information and tips to identify and destroy the pseudoscientist' theories and their faith in whatever is in fashion at this moment (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). Avrei anche preferito un approccio piú scientifico nella demistificazione delle idiozie correnti, ma se questo linguaggio rende il libro piú leggibile, ben venga. "
205,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51440612-kateking58,3,"Admitedly, the blog is more entertaining (i.e. more sweary) but I suppose that being taken seriously as an author requires more gravitas in writing.There are important messages in this book, about how needlessly limiting what you eat simply because someone with good PR and glossy hair spins a tale that seems superficially plausible is a bad idea. The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC. I look forward to reading The Angry Chef's thoughts on the programme."
206,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22611105-chelsea-harrop,4,"This is a very funny and honest book that confronts a lot of the bullshit surrounding food. It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "
207,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007226-johanne,5,"Read this book. It is a really excellent look at the realities of food and nutrition, it is also funny and informative. A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ? Correlation is not causation"

Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
209,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!

In fact, I don't even care anymore)) After finishing this book I got this feeling we experience when being kids. When we don't yet know about skinny being sexy, pastries ruining our shapes, diets, ""superfoods"" and all that jazz. When we simply enjoy what we do and eat. When we don't obsess and overthink. And I feel grateful for getting to experience it, again. "

At times very funny and enjoyable, this is also a very informative read that gives a proper explanation of what science is and how this applies to the world of food and eating. The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."

The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "

Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"
219,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52737534-callum-soukup-croy,3,"Warner writes in two voices on occasion, as his self and his instinctive brain. However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."

It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’.

"" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

Not just for the information, which, without further research, I could never say is 100% correct, but in the way he totally changed my mindset regarding food, nutrition, and the proliferation of pseudoscience in the internet age. It's at least disappointing and at worst despicable how many sham diets and quack ""professionals"" there are who will take advantage of people in bad circumstances (cancer, diabetes, depression, etc.) and tell them ""well if you cut out carbs you'll be cured!"" The Angry Chef is a lover of food and a lover of people, and I'm glad he's fighting this fight. "
222,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5145798-b,5,"What a wonderful, important book. The silly things we’ve come to believe about food, and why we believe them. Toxins, clean eating, raw food, paleo, the peril of gluten- things I’ve wanted to shake educated, rational, decent people for believing & repeating- it’s all challenged here, with swearing & science, my two favourite things. Hooray! "
223,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
224,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "
225,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368999-jessica,4,"Why does chef Anthony Warner go by ""the angry chef""? He's tired of food bullsh*t and pseudoscience masquerading as truth and fact. In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

226,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
227,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
228,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
229,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
230,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
231,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
232,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
233,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"
234,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,4,"I didn't like so much the ""blog way"" of the author to convey a lot of useful information and tips to identify and destroy the pseudoscientist' theories and their faith in whatever is in fashion at this moment (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). Avrei anche preferito un approccio piú scientifico nella demistificazione delle idiozie correnti, ma se questo linguaggio rende il libro piú leggibile, ben venga. "
235,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51440612-kateking58,3,"Admitedly, the blog is more entertaining (i.e. more sweary) but I suppose that being taken seriously as an author requires more gravitas in writing.There are important messages in this book, about how needlessly limiting what you eat simply because someone with good PR and glossy hair spins a tale that seems superficially plausible is a bad idea. The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC. I look forward to reading The Angry Chef's thoughts on the programme."
236,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22611105-chelsea-harrop,4,"This is a very funny and honest book that confronts a lot of the bullshit surrounding food. It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "

A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ?

It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
239,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!

I feel like they've boosted my immunity towards aggressive and manipulative media as well as decreased my confusion about what's ""good"" and what's a ""no-no"". In fact, I don't even care anymore)) After finishing this book I got this feeling we experience when being kids. When we don't yet know about skinny being sexy, pastries ruining our shapes, diets, ""superfoods"" and all that jazz. When we simply enjoy what we do and eat. When we don't obsess and overthink. And I feel grateful for getting to experience it, again. "

At times very funny and enjoyable, this is also a very informative read that gives a proper explanation of what science is and how this applies to the world of food and eating. The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."
247,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8941478-carl-phillips,5,"A book that needed to be written given the proliferation of idiocy that exists today in the world in the name of dieting and healthy eating. The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "
248,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23974131-tom-donaghey,5,"	THE ANGRY CHEF: Bad Science and The Truth About Healthy Eating by Chef Anthony Warner is just what the title says it is. Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"

However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."

It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"
251,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23432552-lindsay,5,"Read this book. Not just for the information, which, without further research, I could never say is 100% correct, but in the way he totally changed my mindset regarding food, nutrition, and the proliferation of pseudoscience in the internet age. It's at least disappointing and at worst despicable how many sham diets and quack ""professionals"" there are who will take advantage of people in bad circumstances (cancer, diabetes, depression, etc.) and tell them ""well if you cut out carbs you'll be cured!"" The Angry Chef is a lover of food and a lover of people, and I'm glad he's fighting this fight. "

Toxins, clean eating, raw food, paleo, the peril of gluten- things I’ve wanted to shake educated, rational, decent people for believing & repeating- it’s all challenged here, with swearing & science, my two favourite things. Hooray! "
253,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
254,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "
255,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368999-jessica,4,"Why does chef Anthony Warner go by ""the angry chef""? He's tired of food bullsh*t and pseudoscience masquerading as truth and fact. In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods.

256,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This book is a real interesting read about the more recent trend of ‘healthy eating’ that we seem to be inundated with these days. Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
257,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
258,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
259,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
260,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
261,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
262,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
263,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"

I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). Avrei anche preferito un approccio piú scientifico nella demistificazione delle idiozie correnti, ma se questo linguaggio rende il libro piú leggibile, ben venga. "

The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC. I look forward to reading The Angry Chef's thoughts on the programme."

It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "

A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ?

Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
269,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!

In fact, I don't even care anymore)) After finishing this book I got this feeling we experience when being kids. When we don't yet know about skinny being sexy, pastries ruining our shapes, diets, ""superfoods"" and all that jazz. When we simply enjoy what we do and eat. When we don't obsess and overthink.

At times very funny and enjoyable, this is also a very informative read that gives a proper explanation of what science is and how this applies to the world of food and eating. The insight in to certain restrictive diets and the crazy claims they make, particularly in relation to curing complex issues like autism and cancer was a real eye opener, and it is truly shocking that there are such charlatans out there."

The first and last thirds of the book are its strongest, looking at specific diets and fads and dismantling their nonsense systematically. The chapters on GAPS and the link between cancer and food were especially strong. The ending where he argues that allowing pseudoscience to exist even a little opens the door for idiots to tell other idiots lies about science is note perfect. Where the book falls down a bit is where it loses this sharp focus and tries to broaden narrative. I think it could have worked with more care by the author, but the fact that this book is written by a blogger is evident from the start. Also - the part where he discusses the idea that supermarkets and processed food helped liberate women from the kitchen is idea i have come across before, notably by jay Rayner, and is a argument that, when well argued, resonates. I feel Anthony Warner left himself open to attack by skirting the detail there. Similarly, I think the part where he attacked the idea of ""home cooked"" always being better than ""factory made"" was far to brief, and would have strengthened the book markedly had he expanded his points. Five stars though. While, technically, the writing was not perfect the arguments and points he makes in this book are long overdue. This book needs to exist and needs to be read more widely. "

Chef Warner takes on all the health fade diets and new age cures for everything under the sun. Modern day snake oil salesmen have taken over the field of nutritious eating, expounding dozens of cures based on the worst type of science, on in many cases either nonexistent or disproven science. The “cures” they propose do cause a change in the body, but then anytime you radically alter you diet, no matter how, you will see a change. Usually water loss that many think is a true weight loss.	Basically it is as simple as calories taken in and used. Lower the first, increase the second, or some combination, and you will see a change. All things in moderation is a great guide to live by.	For every food myth out there, Chef finds ways to either debunk the nonsense or sound the bell for the good. But the nonsense is winning, mostly because people do not want to do the actual work needed to get into the shape they desire and the pseudo-food scientists sound like their miracle cures will make you lose weight without breaking a sweat. “Drink three glasses of the goo everyday and you will poop your way into a wonderful new body!”	Who could argue with that?	Just remember, there are trained nursing and health care specialists out there who will work with you to help you find the you of your dreams. But as long as there are billions to be made selling snake oil, someone will sell it. But you don’t have to drink the stuff.	My compliments to the Chef!"

However, reading this book you feel as the whole thing may have been written by two people. The first half is superb, disproving fad diets using science-based evidence as well as combining a light, readable tone to keep it interesting. You get firmly on the side of the author, believing that he knows the truth that these 'nutritional therapists' are positing. However, by the time you get half way through the book you realise that perhaps Warner is not so driven by evidence as he would suggest. He slips into anecdotes more and more to the point where some chapters seem as made-up as the food bloggers and clean-eaters he berates. The writing style, at first witty and engaging, becomes irritating and child-like. It may work on a blog with short sections consumed sparingly but it is too much in a book of this sort. Plus, the structure of the book just feels messy. You move from topic to topic that seemingly have no link and it is hard to link one concept to another.I know I'm being more critical than kind so three stars perhaps seems excessive but the first two parts of the book are really good. If you find yourself drawn to the book then read those and leave it there otherwise prepare to be disappointed."

It is a fine way to embellish the most important moments of our lives, adding richness and texture to precious times and enhancing moments of joy. The more we break food down, the more we try to define it by the chemicals it contains, the more we label items as clean, good, immoral, contaminated or pure, and the more we attach guilt or shame to our choices, the further away we get from the sensible, balanced relationship that we need.The author emphasizes the need to recognize and understand that when it comes to the food we eat, control and restriction are not enviable moral qualities. A positive relationship with food comes from embracing variety and achieving balance. The joy we can find in food and cookery is more powerful than any antioxidant or phytochemical when it comes to improving our health and well-being. Poor dietary choices do not occur when people are driven by hedonistic pleasure, they occur when people eat without thought, and that will never happen if we engage with and truly love the food we eat.Eat everything in moderation and move around more is the mantra. Try to be immune to the charms of easy narratives and false hopes, because at best they are wrongheaded, and at worst, truly dangerous. Eating a takeaway, a pack of biscuits, or a ready meal now and again will not harm you. Neither will a bowl of kale and quinoa salad. Just make sure that this is not all you ever eat. The only diets that can harm your health are diets of restricted choice, lacking in variety and devoid of joy. It is human nature to see correlation and imply causation. The reason that correlation can occur between two things without there necessarily being a causal relationship is explained by something known as a 'confounding factor' -- the real, unseen cause of the correlation. To understand that correlation does not always imply causation is without doubt the most important thing that science can teach us. Throughout this book, the author presents dozens of examples of mistaken beliefs and pseudoscience, most of which exist and proliferate due to this misunderstanding.So what is the secret to healthy eating? Eat lots of different stuff.Not too much or too little.Try to achieve a bit of balance.Try not to feel guilty. Most importantly, never make anyone else feel guilt or shame about the food they eat.The ANGRY CHEF GUIDE TO SPOTTING BULLS**T IN THE WORLD OF FOOD has been summarised as follows:They will have a food philosophy.They will try to sell you detox.They will tell you that your illness is your own fault. They will fit the health blogger template.**They will talk about superfoods.They will use anecdotes as evidence.They will quote ancient wisdoms at you.They will tell you things were better ‘back then’. They will tell you all these things with great certainty** ""I was living my impossibly glamorous life as an ""insert glamorous occupation here"" at a hundred miles an hour, eating all sorts of junk and not caring what I put in my body. My health was really suffering. It was only when l started to take control of the food I was eating that my health improved. I started my ""insert name of made-up diet plan here"" and it revolutionized my life. All my friends just begged me to share my recipes with them and that's how my blog was born. "" What is THE ANGRY CHEF’S GUIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE WORLD OF FOOD:Dietitians (RD): The term is protected by law, so if someone uses this term to describe themselves it means they are qualified to use the science of nutrition to devise eating plans for patients. A dietitian, also signified by the initials RD after their name, will have studied a degree in dietetics and will be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).Registered nutritionist (RNutr)- by which the author means those registered with the Association for Nutrition (AfN), who give guidance on the health effects of food. They will have studied nutrition science on a properly accredited university degree course. They do an important job. Nutritionist -This is where the problems start. Whereas dietitian is a legally protected term, nutritionist is not. Technically anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, and many people do. Get a fancy sign printed up for your door, stick an advert in the local newsagent’s and start taking consultations. Give it a few weeks and media outlets will probably start asking you for your hot takes on nutritional topics.Qualified nutritionist - It is a different matter if you want to call yourself a qualified nutritionist, as many of the current breed of internet-based health gurus do. You will need to obtain a nutritional qualification. Fortunately, this need not be much of a hindrance to your new-found career, as a nutritional qualification can be obtained with a few hours of online study for about £20. Congratulations, you may now get a new sign made and put up your prices.Nutritional therapist -Nutritional therapist is distinctly more new-age and holistic sounding. Of course, it is just a made-up thing and the term is not protected in any way. We are all nutritional therapists.Nutrition experts- The angry chef feels anyone who feels the need to call themselves an expert in anything probably isn’t one. Other titles to look out for are healthy eating expert, naturopathic nutritionist, naturopath, holistic food healing expert, wellbeing expert and mindful nutrition specialist. By the time I finish this post, there will probably be dozens more spurious titles created with blogs, Instagram accounts and bowls full of kale, all clamouring for the attention of newspapers and magazines. Hopefully now you will be better equipped to sniff them out when they do.Lastly, the author suggests focusing on whether or not you see the initials RD or RNutr after someone’s name and, if not, take their advice with a pinch of salt. Just make sure that pinch contains less than 20% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) of sodium!"

Toxins, clean eating, raw food, paleo, the peril of gluten- things I’ve wanted to shake educated, rational, decent people for believing & repeating- it’s all challenged here, with swearing & science, my two favourite things. Hooray! "
283,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57013271-joe,2,"The first couple chapters are good. The author points out the importance of systematic reviews of evidence rather than simply making nutritional judgements based on singular studies.However, the rest of the book is mostly a waste of everyone's time. Sure it points out some of the flawed thinking in modern dietary trends, but the author has plenty of his own flawed thinking and bullsh*t."
284,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36110744,5,"I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical when I found this book for three pounds, sitting outside a local bookshop on the discount table. After all, why should I take a chef's word on something like dieting and nutrition? What could he know? Well, regardless of skepticism, I ended up buying it...and finishing it in two days. As someone who used to struggle with an eating disorder, this book offered me a catharsis that I wish had been available to me in the deepest days of my disease. It shined a light on why precisely I am so intrigued by all of these 'pure', 'clean eating' movements that are so popular on social media nowadays. Spoiler alert: it's a need for control, a need for order, and a need to feel more disciplined than the next guy down who indulges in potato chips while watching the newest episode of Last Week Tonight and contemplating the state of the Western world (yes, sometimes that guy is you, last week. But you're purer and better now! You ate an apple instead!)This book debunks everything. It debunks the myth that gluten free is inherently healthier, that the paleo diet will unlock some ancient, primal power within you (previously suppressed by the soft modern lives we all lead), and that putting honey in your brownies is better than using good old fashioned sugar.Not only does this book debunk these myths using logic and well sourced facts, but it examines the real world harm that they do. While there are extreme and tragic cases of people using 'clean eating' instead of cancer treatment, most of it was...stuff I could really relate to. Thinking you are less 'pure' for eating something you didn't make from scratch. Believing that a painful relationship with food (in which you stare longingly at freshly baked croissants in the bakery window and silently verbally abuse yourself for even being tempted in the first place) is a healthy one. Striving for the effortless happiness and purity that so many of these online health gurus seem to have, wondering why your hair is still dull and your skin is still oily when you've been doing everything they said to do.Attaching your self worth to the things that you consume. Creating rules for yourself so that you may demonstrate your abstinence to those around you and feel in some way superior, because you refuse to eat potatoes.I think that is what hit me the hardest. Because while I became vegetarian as a way to cultivate empathy in myself and to help the environment, I do tend to fall down the rabbit hole every now and again. That is, the rabbit hole of agave syrup instead of sugar, of all-raw meals of cold broccoli and baby carrots, of pH testing your food (alright, I admit, I never did that one).The Angry Chef hits the nail on the head when he says that food isn't meant to be all that complicated. It is, in fact, one of the simplest pleasures that life has to offer. Because it is so deeply unsatisfying to accept that there is no secret formula, that moderation is key, we are eager to listen to enthusiastic health gurus telling us to eat spoonfuls of coconut oil and deprive ourselves of carbs. We like concrete rules. I like concrete rules.This book is one with a freeing message: everything in moderation, try new things, and don't listen to the pseudoscience. This thing needs to be an international bestseller. But of course it won't be. It feels good to be the health nut with the weird food rules, toxic though it may be. I suppose if nothing else, it was enlightening to see how my occasional renewed obsession with food rules, even though it surfaces as rabid veganism or 'I only eat foods you can find at Whole Foods that most people have never heard of'-ism, is actually likely a manifestation of my former eating disorder's need for control. And that enlightenment has given me leave to ignore all those rules and live my life.If you find yourself perplexed by all this new age, gluten free, hippie bullshit, then I would advise you to read The Angry Chef. It is the one shining ray of hope in a post truth, quinoa obsessed world. "
285,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368999-jessica,4,"Why does chef Anthony Warner go by ""the angry chef""? He's tired of food bullsh*t and pseudoscience masquerading as truth and fact. In this book he discusses pseudoscience and why it's so easy to convince people that a certain diet is THE way to lose weight/be healthy/live your best life/etc. It was really interesting when he discussed why our brains are wired to want connections and simple explanations when nutritional science is not always that simple. He takes on many popular diet trends like keto, paleo, and detoxing and basically rips the pseudoscience behind them apart. While I didn't agree with every word he said, for the most part I was already on his side before I even read the book. He does a great job explaining the bits of science that are used to create trends and why they aren't right and in some cases can even be dangerous to follow. If you miss bread or want to enjoy a cupcake every once in awhile the angry chef agrees. His diet advice is to eat in moderation and eat a varied diet - cutting out whole food groups is NOT good. If you're not sure where to turn with all the various diets and superfoods out there give this book a try and see if you agree with The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food.The Angry Chef's Rules for Spotting Bullsh*t in Food1) They will have a food philosophy.2) They will try to sell you detox.3) They will tell you that your illness is your own fault.4) They will fit the health-blogger template.5) They will tell you that the truth is not up for debate.6) They will talk about superfoods.7) They will use anecdotes as evidence.8) They will quote ancient wisdoms at you as fact.9) They will tell you things were better ""back then.""10) They will tell you all these things with great certainty.Some quotes I liked:""I generally pride myself on an ability to pick apart the misunderstandings and confusions that result in false beliefs being born, but in the case of detox diets and detox products, there is no mystery to pick apart. Despite it being a multibillion-dollar industry, no clinical study has shown any commercially available detox diet or treatment to have any clinical effect in the removal of toxins."" (p. 25)[Best subheading EVER] ""WTF is wrong with potatoes"" (p.121)""If you cannot fit potatoes into a healthy balanced diet, there is something wrong with the way you are eating. They are a near perfect food, and to create rules that exclude them not only feels wrong, it is wrong."" (p. 123)""Sugar is just sugar. It is not good or bad. It is only toxic if you eat too much of it, and by that measure all food is toxic (remember the does makes the poison: you can die from drinking too much water)...To attach the language of toxicity and addiction to a food we literally cannot avoid means pouring vitriol and scorn on all of us...If you are not sugar-free, if your children are not sugar-free, then you are toxic, you are contaminated. You and your kin are foul and pestilent junkies, no longer worthy, no longer deserving of medical treatment, contaminated and beyond hope, destined to die fat, lonely, miserable, and addicted."" (p. 149)""Sugar is important. It is the sweetness of freshly picked peas. It is in the bliss of strawberries warmed by the sun. The sweetness of foods can enrich our lives; it can bring us joy and pleasure. Sweetness is a vital part of the flavor palette of every cook and true sweetness comes only from sugar...To dismiss and reject the use of sugar because of false notions of toxicity is to misunderstand what it is to eat healthily. A healthy diet is one of joy, not one of rejection and denial."" (p. 151)""Social media creates many closed, self-affirming populations capable of perpetuating and reinforcing falsehoods. Ideas don't have to travel the world to do a lot of damage."" (p. 281)"

Truthfully, these holistic cures have been around since the dawn of man but they’ve taken a more sinister turn with the push of modern gurus who spout out about things that they really don’t have much of a clue of but make it sound like it will be a cure all for whatever ailment. These charlatans are usually pushing some sort of agenda that inevitably profits them more than the audience they preach to. Take any sort of diet out there and check their parameters: you will be sure to see that you need something that only that particular diet can offer on their website for a generous fee. People like rules. Diets have a ton of rules – even to the detriment of your health.Actually this book is more of a carry on rant from his website, but once you get past the swearing and the occasional rambling rants there is a lot to be gleaned from it. Firstly it is about asking questions and listening to the answers. And then questioning the answers you’re given to be sure you really understand what is being offered. Food is food is food – but there are a lot of questions these days as to what is proper to eat and what isn’t and why that is. Some things are too good to be true and common sense is not so common. Most people want to be told what is right as opposed to determining it for themselves. Fast food is easy but can be expensive. Real food is good but takes time and effort most people don’t like to give it. The expense of fast food is worth it compared to dealing with actual cooking (and the clean up). It’s always a trade off.Ultimately its up to you to make decisions as to what to eat and why (because, after all, you are the master of your choices). Unfortunately there are a lot of misleading cues out there that confuse the issue in the name of ‘helping’ you and it’s easy to get side tracked by something that seems legitimate but in truth really isn’t. Plus the easy access of fast food has created a monster of health issues that our society will be dealing with for years to come. (Forget about all of the other options and issues that have spawned from that monster). So the Angry Chef has set out a few guidelines to help you along the way. He’s certainly worth listening to as his background is working as a chef and in the food industry – the credentials speak volumes. And people – there isn’t an easy option here. Food consumption is an obvious necessity for survival but it doesn’t have to be complicated. If you need rules to help you out, use these: Firstly eat everything in moderation. Too much of one thing is not healthy – regardless of the food. Balance is the key. Secondly – move more. Thirdly – and most importantly – food is to be enjoyed, so learn to cook simply. There is nothing so satisfying on this good green Earth as a home cooked meal.And finally, be conscious of your decisions and don’t be led over the cliff of promises. This is an interesting and provocative read. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but don’t let anyone dissuade you – it’s always important to be informed. And there is a lot of crap out there to wade through to get to some truth."
287,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Subtitled ""Bad Science and the Truth About Healthy Eating"", this book examines the spectrum of diet cults that are widely followed but unsupported by evidence or food science. The author starts with the story of lapwings and hares in England. People seeing scratched out nests of eggs amongst the frolicking wild hares associated the two, assuming the hares produced the eggs. The eggs actually belonged to lapwings which were not obvious as they are very flighty. This mistaken correlation lead to the idea of the Easter Bunny.Cult diets covered by the author include gluten free, detox, alkaline ash, paleo, clean eating, sugar avoidance, antioxidants, coconut oil and other supposed superfoods.One mechanism that lends support of these diets is regression to the mean. Many undertake a diet when they are feeling poorly, find themselves improving and attribute the change to the diet. However, many people feeling poorly are at an abnormal state and likely to improve anyhow.Statistics can be misleading. The author looks at the stat that persons eating 50 g of bacon a day have an 18 percent greater chance of developing bowel cancer. However, the numbers can also be viewed that the chance of avoiding bowel cancer is 94 percent if bacon is avoided, versus 93 percent if the 50 g of bacon is consumed each day.A chapter on eating disorders questions whether the prevalence of cult diets has been a contributor to the rise of such disorders which were uncommon before 1970.The GAPS diet particularly dangerous as it calls for restrictive eating that is does not provide proper nutrition. Claims are made that it can cure autism, causing parents to adopt it for such children thus endangering their health.A number of diets are claimed to be effective in fighting cancer. An early example was the Gerson diet. A review of 86 of his patients showed no effectiveness. It continues to be adopted by people, largely due to desperation and false hope. The author presents one case where a woman with cancer died from such a mal-nutritious diet earlier than her expected mortality due to the cancer.Throughout the book Warren ponders the reasons that people engage in cult diets, and looks at possible approaches to discouraging what he feels to be a completely irrational relationship with food. Along the way, he develops ""The Angry Chef Guide to Spotting Bullshit in the World of Food"". You should suspect bullshit when the supposed expert:1. has a ""food philosophy""2. tries to sell you detox3. tells you that your illness is your own fault4. fits the help blogger template5. talks about superfoods6. uses anecdotes as evidence7. quotes ancient wisdoms to you8. tells you things were better back then9. tells you these things with great certaintyThe epilogue starts with a quote from Bertrand Russell: ""Fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser men so full of doubts.""Excellent book."
288,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"*Disclaimer: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*This is an excellent book on food and the bad science behind different food fads and diets. It is engaging and well written, with humour throughout. Angry Chef is to food what Ben Goldacre is to medicine, passionate about explaining and dispelling pseudoscience, and genuinely seeking to enable you to make informed decisions based on science. I enjoyed the parts where he has conversations with his 'inner voice / instinctive brain', as it is very humorous and not too frequent to be annoying, but I can understand this might not be for everyone. I liked the idea of Science Columbo, but it might have been used a little too frequently. I had no idea about half of the diets described, but then again, I don't diet or research new diets online. It was very interesting learning the 'nugget' of science the diet is based on, and how it is extrapolated or manipulated out of all proportion. I really appreciated the author's genuine love and appreciation of all food, and that everything should be in moderation, as this was genuinely refreshing in the modern day obsession with vilifying specific foods, like sugar, fat and processed foods. I felt the author has a real understanding of how people actually live, and so by giving unrealistic recommendations like 'cook all meals from scratch' it is just unrealistic and makes people feel shame and guilt. I was so happy to read a chef acknowledging modern living and how food should be a source of joy in all its forms, that pizzas are ready meals are not 'evil', and restrictive diets are not only bad for our health but our wellbeing too. I think the author does a great job at explaining there are no 'good or bad' foods or ingredients, simply variety and moderation, which I think is a wonderful message. This is a wonderful book, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in food or science. Maybe not for the Gluten-free Raw food aficionado in your life, but suitable for almost anyone else. There is mild swearing occasionally in the book, but I think this goes without saying with a title like 'Angry Chef'. This book is simply wonderful and should receive as much attention as Ben Goldacre's Bad Science and Simon Singh's Trick or Treatment, definitely a 4.5/5"
289,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64048715-lisa-tollefson,5,"Brilliant and funny book. He takes apart several faddish diets that everyone knows are good for you and shows how they all have the same MO, as it were. I worked in a health food store ages ago and saw so many new products come through, each with claims to do this or that, and I'd always wondered what research had been done. Were the experiments valid or poorly designed? He points out that none of the wildly popular diets have been scientifically tested, or even have good case histories written up. They're all based on anecdotal evidence, which is unreliable.The interesting thing about all these diets, which are truly all about weight loss at their core, even if they're masked as lifestyle changes, is that they all work. For a little while, at least. He explains why that is, and it makes perfect sense. What I love most about this book is that it's really well written. He obviously used a team of professionals to make sure that it didn't hit the market until it was ready. The grammar and spelling are right, his thoughts are clear and concise, and believe me, that's a joy. I've read some of the books by diet gurus, and so far, not a one of them would have passed my high school English class with anything better than a C+. Everything he says is well-cited, too. The bibliography is quite extensive.So if you've had a niggling feeling that something is up with the weekly ""eat this way, your life will turn around"" fad, if you've ever wondered why there seems to be a fabulous new diet every couple of months that everyone is talking about, read this.Before I close, I will say that the one thing he doesn't talk about is that there are valid reasons to choose a particular diet. The most obvious ones are religious, but many vegetarians/vegans choose for non-dietary reasons. Others choose for cultural or economic reasons(he actually does talk about this a little), and some because certain foods just don't seem to sit well. If you spend a sleepless night every time you eat anything with tomato sauce, the brighter of us will stop eating tomato sauce. But these are minor points. We all adopt some kind of diet choice. He tells us, be smart about it, and eat the widest variety you can, because micronutrients are found everywhere, and, mostly, because food is good stuff. It brings joy. If what you eat doesn't make you smile, you're doing something wrong."
290,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513-deirdre,4," He made me cry. Honestly when I read the quote from page 245 ""'A hospice patient admitted for end-of-life care said that one thing she really wanted before the end was to eat a few slices of French baguette with butter, but refused the ofer from the hospice chef as she was fearful of taking carbs that would ""feed her cancer cells""' Catherine Collins RD, fellow of the British Dietetic Association."" any diet that demands a terminally ill person is wrong to have something they really want to have is evil. Now I'm not in that situation, but I am someone who has to deal with dietary restrictions day in and day out, I'm technically gluten sensitive because I had to give up gluten before a formal diagnosis (gastroenterologist: there's healing damage there, whatever you're doing, keep at it), but I respond quickly and upsettingly to gluten present in my foodstuffs (and this has been verified but an accident or two), so on one level I'm quite happy with the fashion for gluten-free but dammit I would love good French bread, or even one dinner out where I had freedom to explore the menu more. Another quote that hit more for truth is ""Cancer is a complex, shapeshifting disease that has staggered and confounded the best researchers for a hundred years. (p.247) and I would love to shake it in the face of the people who tell me that I asked for, ate for, lived for, the Hodgkins Lymphoma science threw into remission 15 years ago. This book is a mildly sweary, angry with bad science, rant about how our diets seem to have become the latest battleground for morality, how what we eat has become a heavily charged moral issue with some claiming that only by following their creed will we be purfied from this ""too, too solid flesh"" and achieve some sort of living purity or sainthood, freed from illness and pain, having learned the lessons of purity and wellness from the chosen few.Yes it's a bit more sweary than some people are comfortable with but I'd say it's no more sweary than I would be if I was talking to people on the topic. There are some citations and it could do with a suggested reading list but overall I found it one of the best books on eating that I've read in a long time."
291,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321477-jos-phine-word-revel,5,"Actual rating: 4.5 starsInitial thoughts: This has got be one of the most refreshing books on food that I've read over the past couple of years. I appreciated Warner's breakdown of the scientific method to explain to readers how to filter information on food and nutrition. He had a lot of thoughts on how important that is as opposed to merely learning facts in school and I couldn't agree more. My education's been a lot about parsing out hypotheses, theories and facts and I've got to say, it's served me well.Warner's takedown of unqualified health gurus, unqualified bloggers, the clean eating movement, paleo diet, and so forth was fascinating to say the least. When someone once referred me to Dr. Mercola's website, I was sceptical of several claims but wasn't sure how to go about expressing my discomfort and distrust. Maybe I should just thrust this book into their hands.One chapter that particularly intrigued me was about the values we attach to food. He referred to veganism as an example, though I wish he had explored that a little more. He didn't seem quite so fond of letting our moral compass guide our food choices, which I didn't fully agree with. To be fair, I decided to try try vegetarianism this year, is I'm not unbiased either. I think it is important to consider our impact on the environment and do our best to have a balanced diet. I'm concerned with mercury and toxins that fish carry too, and am still trying to figure out if/how hormones fed to livestock can affect affect us when we eat meat.In any case, The Angry Chef's Guide to Spotting Bullsh*t in the World of Food should be on your reading list if nutrition matters to you."
292,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49370782-marie-c-warren,4,"I'd just finished reading 'Bad Science' by Ben Goodacre and was interested to explore another take. Angry Chef has lot of similarities (to 'Bad Science')but with a bit more information about food and how 'non-diet' diets draw you in. He also explained the qualifications that Dietitians and Qualified Nutritionists must have as opposed to all the bloggers and book-writers out there that claim to be 'Nutritionists' etc. without formal qualifications. Both books have reminded me to question what I'm told more (including what they told me). I've already thrown out one (diet) book that used the phrase 'Leading Researchers have found' without any qualification, reference or science to back it up. Now I'm going through the rest of my books to see if there are any more to throw out: I'd give them to charity but I don't want to be responsible for spreading further disinformation. The only reason I've dropped him one star is for his suggestion that we start a new disinformation campaign (of his design) to prove how far these things can get : no matter how 'tongue in cheek' he meant it I'd hate to see a single person get taken in by it."
293,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8657353-lohweiqi,4,"Well dosed with humor and a clear narrative, this book does a good job of its aim of acting as a mirror and exposing the real problems (psychological and $$ wise) that lie behind the obsessive clean-eating trend. It does this by focusing on different myths to do with food, as well as giving some tips on how to pick up bullshit (as he says) in the food industry. Read this if you are confused about the very vague marketing and consensus that comes with healthy eating (i.e superfoods. You will also likely feel less confused and less guilty of your own dietary habits.) One other topic that Anthony Warner also really discusses about is scientific education, which never really came to my mind until now. As a science major myself, I find his opinion on the actual value of the scientific method and how it, rather than content-heavy curriculums, should be used in childhood education, really interesting. All in all, a good read! Though I must say some of it1) can get quite repetitive (he spent a couple of chapters repeating the lack of quality evidence for some myths) 2) escalated unnecessarily in his rather emotional upbraid of certain self-righteous healthy eating narratives by projecting certain values on supporters"
294,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,4,"I didn't like so much the ""blog way"" of the author to convey a lot of useful information and tips to identify and destroy the pseudoscientist' theories and their faith in whatever is in fashion at this moment (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). I would have preferred a more scientific approach to demystifying rubbish, but if it makes the book more readable, for me is ok.La cosa che meno mi é piaciuta il il linguaggio ""da blog"" che l'autore usa nel libro, ma ci sono un sacco di informazioni utili e trucchi per identificare e smontare le teorie degli pseudoscienziati e la loro fede in qualunque sia la cosa che va di moda al momento (detox, superfood, clean eating, paleo, gluten free, etc.etc.). Avrei anche preferito un approccio piú scientifico nella demistificazione delle idiozie correnti, ma se questo linguaggio rende il libro piú leggibile, ben venga. "
295,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51440612-kateking58,3,"Admitedly, the blog is more entertaining (i.e. more sweary) but I suppose that being taken seriously as an author requires more gravitas in writing.There are important messages in this book, about how needlessly limiting what you eat simply because someone with good PR and glossy hair spins a tale that seems superficially plausible is a bad idea. The guide to nutritional qualifications is one that more people should know. The case for better science understanding is well made. The checklist for spotting nutritional bullshit needs to be printed out and given to every journalist who writes uncritical puff pieces about celebrity diets and ""miracle foods"".I notice a new celebrity chef onslaught in the ""war"" on obesity and convenience foods starting soon on the BBC. I look forward to reading The Angry Chef's thoughts on the programme."
296,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22611105-chelsea-harrop,4,"This is a very funny and honest book that confronts a lot of the bullshit surrounding food. It's a lot more than just angry ranting though - Anthony Warner gives some solid advice on spotting pseudoscience and myths. You don't necessarily need to be into nutrition/healthy eating to enjoy this either. I have just one criticism: in the chapter on convenience foods, Warner says that ""every time we criticise convenience choices, we are showing our desire to drag women's bodies and minds away from the workplace and back into the kitchen."" This comment irritated me because I think it's completely untrue and illogical. People (including women!) can have valid concerns about convenience foods without believing women belong in the kitchen... "
297,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007226-johanne,5,"Read this book. It is a really excellent look at the realities of food and nutrition, it is also funny and informative. A siren call for applying sensible thinking to the sea of rubbish that the web feeds us. So if you've ever wondered about the antioxidants in blueberries, why so may people eat gluten free and whether you dare have a bacon butty - read this.Plus it reminds us to use the skills that most of us have to assess whether what we are reading makes sense - a reminder that applies far beyond the realm of food:What is the evidence?Is it anecdotal or the product of rigorous research?What qualifications does the person have (and are they real!!- there are a lot of pseudo qualifications out there) ? Correlation is not causation"
298,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46507387-angie-leonie,4,"Okay I got my non fiction November tick (well done me), but I won't lie I knew nothing of the author and his work, I was intriged by the cover and a small note in the corner. Anyways, I laughed/howled/shook my finger and debated with my own beliefs with food while scrolling through the pages. It's been a while I've gobbled up a book that is not fiction and avoided people so I could finish. Great think piece on food science and the myths behind some of the food trends of today. Really think more people should grab a copy and read, before investing in many of the healthy lifestyle-food rule literature on offer right now. "
299,1786072165,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814540-sherry-mackay,3,An interesting read. The author brings up lots of issues that I agree with as to the ridiculous nature of superfoods etc. It’s more of a psychological insight than a look at food really. He explains how humans are easily led by the instinctive brain which prefers easy answers to problems. One thing like gluten can be easily tamed in our diet giving us a false sense of control. I found some of this book hard going. I was also a bit surprised I guess is the word by how little it was actually about food. He is a trained scientist so not surprising really. But I would have liked to read a bit more about food!
