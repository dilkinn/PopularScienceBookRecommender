In the first half of the book, Berne introduces transactional analysis as a way of interpreting social interactions. He describes three roles or ego states, known as the Parent, the Adult, and the Child, and postulates that many negative behaviors can be traced to switching or confusion of these roles. He discusses procedures, rituals, and pastimes in social behavior, in light of this method of analysis. For example, a boss who talks to his staff as a controlling 'parent' will often engender self-abased obedience, tantrums, or other childlike responses from his employees. The second half of the book catalogs a series of ""mind games"" in which people interact through a patterned and predictable series of ""transactions"" which are superficially plausible (that is, they may appear normal to bystanders or even to the people involved), but which actually conceal motivations, include private significance to the parties involved, and lead to a well-defined predictable outcome, usually counterproductive. The book uses casual, often humorous phrases such as ""See What You Made Me Do,"" ""Why Don't You — Yes But,"" and ""Ain't It Awful"" as a way of briefly describing each game. In reality, the ""winner"" of a mind game is the person that returns to the Adult ego-state first.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه مارس سال 2002 میلادیعنوان: بازی ها : روانشناسی روابط انسانی؛ نویسنده: اریک برن؛ برگردان: اسماعیل فصیح؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، ذهن آویز، چاپ نخست 1366، در 242 ص، نمودار، نمایه، کتابنامه، چاپ بیستم پاییز 1393؛ شابک: 9789647390736؛ موضوع: روانشنلسی روابط انسانی، روابط بین اشخاص، روابط اجتماعی از نویسندگان کانادایی - سده 20 مبرگردان کتابی از «اریک برن» در مورد روانشناسی روابط انسانی ست. انسان به عنوان یک موجود اجتماعی، پیچیدگی‌های رفتاری بسیاری دارد، انسان‌ها وابسته به: جغرافیا، ژنتیک، نوع تربیت، و چندین و چند پارامتر دیگر، رفتارهای متفاوتی را در برابر عوامل مختلف در پیش می‌گیرند، و به شرایط اجتماعی گوناگون، عکس العمل‌های دیگرگونه نشان می‌دهند. انسان امروز بسیار اجتماعی است، و دایره‌ ی روابطش از محدوده‌ ی خانواده، نزدیکان، و حتی محل زندگی، بسیار فراتر رفته است. روابط انسانی امروز، کاربردهایی در: سیاست، اقتصاد، فرهنگ، و دیگر مسائل کلان جامعه دارد، انسان امروز برای داشتن روابط سالم و پویا احتیاج دارد، به درک صحیحی از خودش برسد، تا سپس بتواند دیگر انسان‌ها را نیز درک کند، و مسیری برای ایجاد روابط سالم و کارآمد بسازد. «اریک برن» نظریه ی «تحلیل رفتار متقابل» را ارائه داده اند، که می‌توان این نظریه را داشتن کلید روابط انسانی سالم دانست. اگر علاقمندید به زبانی ساده و گویا و به دور از پیچیدگی‌های ویژه ی اصطلاحات روانشناسی، درباره‌ ی این مسئله بیشتر بدانید، و راه حل‌های مناسب و کاملی برای بهبود روابطتان پیدا کنید، کتاب «بازی‌ها» روانشناسی روابط انسانی، اثر «اریک برن» راهنمای بسیار خوبی برای شمایان خواهد بود. ا. شربیانی"
2,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"In this book, Berne argues that a lot of the behaviour you see around you every day can best be understood as different kinds of ""games"". A game is a pattern of behaviour usually involving two or perhaps three people. There is a series of interactions, followed by an emotional payoff.One of the things I found most interesting is that the classification has two dimensions. First, there's the game itself. Second, there's the question of how seriously you're playing: he divides this into First Degree, Second Degree and Third Degree. First Degree is just playing for fun. Second Degree means people's feelings can be badly hurt. Third Degree means that the game ends up ""in the courts, the hospital or the morgue.""So let me give you an example. There's this game he calls RAPO (one of the most appealing aspects of the book is the witty labels he's made up for the different games). First Degree RAPO is a game you can see being played at almost any party. The first person, most often a woman, flirts with the second person, most often a man, until he expresses some concrete sexual interest. Then she frowns and moves on, leaving him feeling like a bit of a jerk. Her payoff is satisfaction that she's managed to discomfit him and reassurance that she has sexual power, but it's basically harmless.In Second Degree RAPO, the first party leads the second party on until, again, he's made some kind of advances. Then she gets openly indignant. Maybe she tells him loudly to keep his hands off her, or she phones her friends and says that he's such a lecherous creep. Second Degree RAPO is a pretty nasty game, because it is of course impossible for third parties to know whether the accusations are true or not. Maybe the guy is just a lecherous creep.In Third Degree RAPO, the first party may get as far as having consensual sex with the second party. She then calls the police and formally accuses him of rape. Third Degree RAPO is, fortunately, not that common. It's clear that it can easily destroy people's lives.I thought it was insightful to point out that all of these are essentially the same thing: the difference is quantitative, not qualitative. I don't buy his analysis completely. But if he doesn't succeed in alerting you to a least a couple of games you're playing without realising it, then I really envy your ability to understand yourself and the things that motivate you."

4,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2508252-mandi,4,"I’m glad I read it, but it wasn’t ultimately everything that I wanted it to be. The theory at the beginning was absolutely fascinating and, even though the books itself is from the 1960’s, it has significant value for being the start of the field of transactional psychology. However, the description of the games themselves was where I found the book lacking. Mostly, this is where I also felt the impact of the book being so dated. Some of his descriptions of games were based on stereotypical gender behavior of that time, but would not be accurate now, nor would his analysis. However, I think that a lot could still be learned even from those games if he had gone into further analysis, but he didn’t. He names the game, goes through a brief write-up, but doesn’t really delve in. What I wanted was to get the description of the game, see an example provided by an analysis, then see an example of the antithesis with similar analysis. Only once does he provide an example of an antithesis. Possibly this analysis that was missing for me could be found in other supplemental psychological texts or in a class discussion in which this book was assigned. However, for someone who is reading on their own for only their own personal benefit, it was lacking. Still, this is the historical beginning from which transactional theory arose and, learning about transactional theory for the first time, it was an incredible read. "
5,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,3,"This was apparently a very big thing when it was published in the 70s, and I can see why. It’s a very interesting way of viewing the world. Unfortunately, like many psychology theories, it takes what is a clever conceit that explains some odd aspects of human interaction and then tries to apply it to everything regardless of whether it fits or not. Add in some very seventies thought processes (which are rather out of favor at the moment but the author probably thought of as universal without realizing how much was a product of the time), and you end up with a rather dated, if still interesting, book.The thesis is that whenever you see people engaged in repetitive interactions that appear to be negative, they’re probably getting something out of it subconsciously. So while someone in a controlling relationship complains about how much their partner limits them, they secretly both enjoy having something to complain about and are actually afraid of the thing they’re being forbidden—the reason they chose this partner in the first place is to have an excuse not to have to do the forbidden thing. The book then goes on to identify a few dozen of these “games”. Most of them are very familiar, and it’s a fruitful way of examining interactions. In applicable cases, it not only provides some reasonable explanations for behaviors that seem inexplicable on the surface, getting to the root of the game offers a way to actually break the pattern. If you’re game playing to feed a deep desire, trying to curtail the surface behavior without addressing the root of the desire will not be particularly effective.However, I think most modern psychologists would say that a number of the games identified have more root causes than this text makes out. The attempt to extrapolate the theory to apply to all behavior oversimplifies things. Just as bad, a number of the observations are deeply sexist, racist, and/or homophobic—very much products of the time. Furthermore, there’s an attempt to apply a Freudian framework that I’m pretty sure has been mostly discredited by the scientific community in the intervening decades. (Every problem does not need to be classified as phallic, oral, or anal. Really.)So it’s an interesting work with some still-applicable ideas. Just don’t try to apply them too hard. "

10,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12153213-kaj-sotala,0,"I find this book impossible to rate. On one hand, it some had very insightful models about human behavior. For example, there is the notion of ""strokes"" - a metaphor for any social interaction in which one person acknowledges the existence of another. As the book defines them:‘Stroking’ may be used as a general term for intimate physical contact; in practice it may take various forms. [...] By an extension of meaning, ‘stroking’ may be employed colloquially to denote any act implying recognition of another’s presence. Hence a stroke may be used as the fundamental unit of social action.In the book's model, social rituals such as saying hello and asking ""how are you"" are reciprocal trades of strokes. Both of the people in question give each other some number of strokes, while maintaining an intuitive calculation of exactly how many strokes they owe each other, depending on the nature of their relationship and the time from their last encounter. And if e.g. I say ""Hi"" to someone and they don't greet me back, I might be offended - because I have given them one stroke, but they haven't reciprocated by giving me a stroke in return.The titular ""games"" are defined as social transactions with some ulterior motive and a payoff. For example, if A and B are going to a movie together and A gets offended over something that B said, B might reply with ""if you are in one of your bad moods, then I will not go with you, and you might as well go alone"". This has an ulterior motive, since B does not really want to go home; the purpose of the statement is to get A to placate B. A may now play along, in which case B wins; or A might refuse to play by pretending not to understand the motive behind B's statement, saying something like ""in that case I will go alone, then"".So far, so good, and there is quite a bit of insightful analysis of some games. Unfortunately however, there is also lots of 1960s sexism, homophobia, and outright bizarre Freudian theory. Some of the described games resonate intuitively - and reading the description of some, I realize that I've either played them myself, or been the target of others. At the same time, other games sound way too specific, and the motives ascribed to the players more like the product of the author's biases than a realistic description. The attitudes implicit in many of the described games - such as the suggestion that a game played by some women is to intentionally seduce men so that the women can then falsely claim to have been raped - are bothersome enough that I don't feel like I can give this book a positive rating."

Dare I say it's a bit of enlightened fun when you can even scratch the surface of deciphering something so complex as Human Relationships.On a psychological-interactive playfield Berne's book is invaluable, it really equips us to call people out on their pattern of behaviour or at least learn how to handle a variety of people if one so wishes to play along.I guess the introspective takeaway from Berne's book is that when people don't want to be emotionally vulnerable or truly intimate they fall into playing roles, this mask is convenient, lazy and predictable.It's also easier to get caught in a pattern of deceiving yourself, and in a way believing you are what role you play.Which is tragic because one is so scared of unmasking that they would never realise whether their actions and feelings are ""real"" or just part of the ""act"" they have taken up as a default."

22,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22119529-aditi,5,"GAMES PEOPLE PLAYGames People Play, the book speaks of the Psychology of human relationships. It introduces the theory of Transactional Analysis. The author, Eric Berne, suggests that all the communication that happens between individuals is actually a transaction between the ego states.An ego states as he defines is “simply the combination of a person’s feeling and his behavioural patterns” and any transaction or communication between individuals takes place through the communication these ego states.There are basically three ego states. The Parent, The Adult and The Child. The Parent ego state represents our parents’ state of mind. Its responses are as same as that of our parents.The Adult ego state is the rational and unbiased state of our egos. Its responses depend totally on our own analysis of the situation.The child ego state is our state of mind when we were a child. Its responses depend on the responses we developed when we were a child.Each and every individual have these three ego states and his actions and responses depends entirely on them. It is the interaction of these parts of our personality with the equivalent child, adult and parent in others that make up our relationships.The author later introduces us to Procedures, Rituals, Pastimes, Operations and Games.What we are concerned with are the Games. The author says that there are operations and there are Games. An operation can be a transaction that takes place to solve a purpose. A Game, however, is a transaction that takes place to solve a purpose, but as soon as the purpose is solved, it turns to the disadvantage of the other.The Game, as the author puts, always has a Pay- Off, a hidden reward, whose outcome can be distressing and damaging.We play games all the time and most of the time we are not even aware of it. There are party games, Life games, Martial games, Consulting Room games and even Good games.The most typical games, such as “If it weren’t for you” and “I was trying to help” can be seen in our daily lives. These games are explained by naming the central player as “White” and the secondary player as “Black”. Berne differentiated his Parent, Adult, and Child ego states from actual adults, parents, and children, by using capital letters when describing them.For example, Mrs. White chooses a domineering husband who has restricted her social activity such as dance. Mr. White, on the other hand, was preventing her own fears that she was unaware of. The analysis shows that the Child of Mrs White deliberately chose the domineering husband who can prevent and protect her from the most unfortunate adventures. The game, on the other hand, enables Mrs. White to blame her husband for her lack of social activity by saying “If it were not for you” or Socially as “If it were not for him”Every such small or big game consists of psychological advantages which are described as “Internal psychological advantages”, “External psychological advantages”, “Internal Social Advantages”, External Social advantages” and “existential advantages”.A game may be a five people or a two people game and it may be of many degrees as well. A game played by an alcoholic is a five people game, where Mr. White, the Alcoholic plays the central character of the game, Ms. Black, the second lead of the game who plays the persecutor. The third role is that of Rescuer. The forth role is the Patsy, someone who believes in White and often gives him money to continue playing. The fifth role is the Connexion, which is the professional role of bartender or liquor-store clerk. He is the source of supply and knows how to communicate with alcoholics. The purpose of this game is not to enjoy liquor but to achieve forgiveness from the Parent of Black.There are games whose purpose is simply to gain sympathy and to feed the ego. Games such as ""Why Don't You — Yes But,"" are played by people only to demonstrate that their problems have no solutions. The game of “Cops and Robbers”, for example, is not played to stay and to never be caught. It had been studied that more criminals enjoy the game of hide and seek rather then obtaining the financial gain. The game they play is “Catch Me if you can”. It doesn’t matter how easy or difficult they make it for the Cops to find them; there ultimate Pay- Off is to get caught.There are other games such as “Schlemiel” or “Now I've got you, you son of a bitch” whose purpose is simply to annoy others or to avenge the injustice he have tolerated his entire life.Apart from the destructive and disturbing pay off of games, some games can be positive in nature. These games are describes by the author as “Good Games”. These games may add to the advantages of the others and the player himself.Although an intricate book, it tells us the pattern and the psychology of our own behavior and responses. Eric Berne"
23,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56943009-joshua-r-taylor,2,"From the start it felt like the model of human relationships Berne describes in this book had so much potential. I think to some extent people already intuitively know that we play social games with each other, quite often without noticing. This book rigorously formalises these games and explores how they're often used to fulfil some need or lack of intimacy. The school of psychotherapy spawned by Berne, transaction analysis, appears to have many practical mental tools and models of thinking for people and therapists alike.This book however was a bore. There isn't any other way of getting around it. The theory was briefly outlined at the start and bits at the end, almost like reading some lecture notes. In-between some common 'games people play' were listed and categorised by their context. At the start these games were interesting but they eventually became monotonous and difficult to stay with. It's such a shame and it's frustrating to me as a reader because the topic feels like it has so much potential.There's also the other issue of the book being written for the social and societal context of 1960s USA. This makes all of the gender-specific games hopelessly inapplicable to modern gender roles and many of them definitely step into the boundaries of being needlessly sexist. Alongside this there are also some...interesting (read stupid) ideas about the motivations behind homosexual men.Lastly, it dawned on me around halfway through the book to ask ""how much of this has been empirically verified?"" It's fine to state these formal mental models that appear to fit in well with our lives, but who's to say that it doesn't just give an illusion of a good fit? The book, being an introduction to the field of transaction analysis, was likely published before any such studies could take place. But until I get some idea of how much of the book's theory has been at least loosely replicated by psychologists (if this can be done at all) I shall have to regard its theory and models with a healthy dose of scepticism."
24,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46519541-victoriano,4,"Growing up, I more or less romanticized the idea of psychology being an exact science. I thought that, with a little effort, human behaviour could be observed in a very structured manner and condensed in a handbook to help with interpersonal relationships. I have since shed some of that wishful thinking, but sometimes I indulge in that fantasy from time to time. Games People Play is the type of interpersonal handbook that I expected to exist as a child. In the book, Berne discusses the concept of transactional analysis. This analysis hinges on the individual’s three ego states: the child, the parent and the adult. It then goes through a very detailed set of games (or transactions) between groups of people, where a certain mixture of ego states perpetuate destructive (or constructive) behaviours. It concludes with the possibility of transcending these games through spontaneity, awareness and intimacy.The most relevant sections for me were definitely the broad strokes in the introduction (creating the ego state framework) and the conclusion (transcending the games). Also, I felt a sense of familiarity with the games described, but the large scope of possible behaviours was overwhelming. This book would probably be a great springboard for a professional, but for casual readers, the very specific explanations were a little too much."
25,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69716492-aya-hamouda,3," Games People Play is considered a timeless classic in the field of Psychology. Really It's A very Interesting Way for Explaining Behavior .One of My Favourite Games in this Book is :Blemish (Party Game): -Played from the Child position of “I am no good” but is masked when this individual meets a new person, to “they are no good”-The “player” then seeks out to prove that they are no good, with thesis’ ranging from “they haven’t got as much as money as I”, “they aren’t nearly as educated”, “they are too _______”, or “what are they even trying to prove”?-An internal advantage of warding off depression, insecurities and feelings of inferiority.I think This Book Can really Help increase self-awareness of the games a person may be ‘playing’ with loved ones, It Can Also Help individuals to Have more fulfilling and healthy relationships with their friends and families ..This Is a Highly Recommended Book , You Can See What I mean If You Give It A try , It Really deserved my time ."

""For certain fortunate people there is something which transcends all classifications of behaviour, and that is awareness; something which rises above the programming of the past, and that is spontaneity; and something that is more rewarding than games, and that is intimacy. But all three of these may be frightening and even perilous to the unprepared. Perhaps they are better off as they are, seeking their solutions in popular techniques of social action, such as 'togetherness'. This may mean that there is no hope for the human race, but there is hope for individual members of it.""
 This is a very small book, but contains a lot of information! Unfortunately it also feels somewhat overboiling with information and unorganized. First published in 1964, most of its content is still relevant and applicable today. People have always played games with each other as a way of social intercourse. In the beginning of the book, Eric Berne explains to us the three ego states (""Parent"", ""Adult"", ""Child"") that are within each of us and how they relate to each other. When we interact with other people, we engage in transactions, some of which are complementary, while others are crossed. Some games are good, but most are dishonest, dramatic, with a concealed motivation. Part 2 of the book provides plenty of examples. 36 games are described, some thoroughly analyzed, others not so, but each game provided more or less a good example of how it works. I was surprised by how many games I ""recognized"" and some even ""relate to"". It's incredible! Berne presents us 7 subcategories for the games: Life Games, Marital Games, Party Games, Sexual Games, Underworld Games, Consulting Room Games and Good Games. The language is a bit old (it was written over 50 years ago), but still accessible. A very dense read for such a small book. "
28,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6354694-cristian-strat,3,"Berne presents the theory of transaction analysis (all communication that happens between individuals is actually a transaction between the Parent, Adult and Child ego states) and then goes on to expose and analyze a series of mind games that people play with each other, consciously or not. Mind games are superficially plausible interactions between people that conceal private significance to the parties involved. (What may appear to be a plausible conversation between two adults might carry an invisible transaction between their other ego states.)Berne points out that some games can be harmless and enjoyable, like for instance flirting, while others undermine and ultimately destroy our relationships.You will likely find at least a few ""mind games"" that hit close to home and you will enjoy deconstructing them. From this perspective alone this book is probably worth reading. On the flip side Berne's writing hasn't aged well (references to women often transported me to the 60's Mad Men era) and I couldn't help but notice that the material starts strong but then gets thinner and thinner and more repetitive as we get closer to the end. Some of the last chapters on positive ""mind games"" seem especially rushed."

I choose Games People Play and I'm so glad I read this back then. What a great psychology book. You have relationships with people, but do you know if it is parent to adult, or parent to child or child to child? This book will give you examples of what a adult to adult relationship will look like as well as the others. The second half of the book goes into the games that we play with each other as humans. Of course, not all humans play games. But I'd guess that more than half of Americans play games. The silent treatment may be one by a different name in this book. I gives examples of spouse games. I can't remember the names of the games, but I do remember saying ""Oh, I played that game before"". And you learn that you are not straightforward in saying what you desire when you play games. You didn't know that adults play games. . .but they do and we learn it from our parents. "

I read it in the Park Ridge Public Library during the year I was dropped out of Grinnell College while facing draft resistance charges. I'd gotten two jobs at Forest Hospital, a proprietary psychiatric facility located in Des Plaines, and thought I should bone up on psychology. Except for a course in Educational Psychology and some reading of Freud, Jung and Rollo May I really had never studied much in the field.This book is extremely commonsensical and simple, the model it presents having much practical utility. I went on to read more of Berne and was eventually trained in Transactional Analysis during an internship at St. Luke's Hospital Center in New York City."

32,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,5,"Some time ago, I made a note that my pastor was enthusiastic about this book and recommended that we in the congregation read it.  Since it was a popular book at the library, it has been some time that I am able to read it, but in reading this book I found myself with a lot of questions.  Which of these games do I play with others?  Which of these games do others play with me?  Which of these games has my pastor seen played and is particularly irritated about?  How can one become comfortable enough with awareness, spontaneity in the face of stressful interactions with others, and intimacy not to play most of these games at all?  To be sure, I read a lot in these pages that I was painfully familiar with [1], and reading the games people play written about in such a clinical fashion was painful and somewhat embarrassing.  I suppose many people will have the same feeling in looking at this book if they see themselves on these pages, and that sort of candor is best done in reading a book individually and perhaps afterward enjoying a discussion of the games with someone who is similarly unsentimental, rather than being confronted abruptly and openly by someone who wants to point out the games that you are playing.This is a short book of under 200 pages and can be profitably read by anyone who is aware of the language of social psychology used by the author, although the version I read was an older one and the language used was pretty unsparing in my own judgment.  Like Gaul, this book is divided into three parts.  The first part of the book gives a brief discussion of the analysis of games:  structural analysis (1), transactional analysis (2), procedures and rituals (3), pastimes (4), and a brief introduction to games (5).  The second part of the book, which makes up the bulk of the contents, gives a brief and possibly obsolete but frighteningly clinical discussion of a thesaurus of various games, divided into gategories like life games (6), marital games (7), party games (8), sexual games (9), underworld games (10), consulting room games (11), and a few good games (12).  The third and final part of the book gives a very brief discussion of going beyond games to intimacy, and the author appears pessimistic about the ability of most people to do this effectively.There are many ways one can take this book, and it is probably best to take the book on a variety of levels.  First, the reader of this book should be sensitive to the sort of games that they play as well as the degrees to which they play them (some of these games, when taken to the ultimate degree, can be a matter of life/death/court).  Likewise, once the reader overcomes a sense of personal embarrassment at having one's own games dealt with in the blunt manner of the author, the next response is likely to be a shrewd desire to recognize the types of games that one will witness so as to diagnose them and take the appropriate countermeasures, which are also talked about in this book along with the personal and social benefits that are gained from playing these games effectively.  Given how common some of these games are, it behooves us to have some idea of what type of games we are playing and how others are playing with us, hopefully so that we can pause and examine ourselves and think if there is a better way to get what we most want out of life rather than playing games to get it.[1] See, for example:https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2014...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2013...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2012...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2011...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2012...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2017...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2017..."

37,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44042149-ellie,1,"The entire book comes across as if the author doesn't actually fully understand his topic, or how to explain it properly. I'm sure this book is fantastic for those who are very experienced in this area of psychology. However for those who are simply interested in learning more about the psychology of the ""games"" we play, this book is not for you.From the title, to the review on the back make this book appear to be something for the average person : it's not.However, this may be my own fault for not reading more about this book before purchasing, however the annoyingly complicated way it's written is not the most grating part.Another frustrating thing about this book is Berne's use of examples!Women, in Berne's mind seem to all be housewives, need a controlling husband, and silly little things who like to play ""wardrobe"" for hours on end. After all ""playing politics"" is for men, and ""man topics"" don't mix with ""women topics""...(Now, I understand this book was written a long time ago, however I don't find I can trust a psychologist who feels women are incapable of understanding something, or even seeing them as proper human beings, it makes you wonder how much of this is simply based on his own sexist stereotypes and not on actual science, and this man does actually fully support the debunked methods of Freudian psychology).One example that sticks out the most in my mind is the example of a women choosing a domineering husband and then complaining when he won't let her do things (i.e. dance) however, when he does allow this she finds she has a fear of dance floors...Apparently the husband is doing his wife a favour by controlling her as he prevents her from facing her fears. According to Berne this is better than the wife getting therapy for her numerous fears. Berne also says that the choice of a domineering husband was because she day dreamed about sexual abuse; and the women was foolish to want more freedom as it meant she missed out of the lavish gifts her husband gave her as he felt guilty for being so controlling.And to imply the domination and deprivation that she doesn't want excites her sexually adds insult to injury.A second example that sticks out in my mind is when Berne describes the game of ""See what you made me do"". In which the wife is in charge of accounting for the family finances. Once again the thing that causes a problem in this is the woman, and the best way to fix this solution is to, yet again, take control away from the woman as she cannot be trusted. Berne once again infantilizes the women in his scenarios.In the following section almost every ""game"" played consists of a woman doing some ""foolish"", something most people do, that riles the ""darling, hard working husband"" and he reacts in an over dramatic, but ""totally justified"" way, once again playing the woman as foolish and childish.If we then look at the game of ""Harried""... oh look! The stupid little woman picks a husband with foolishly unrealistic expectations and then bullies his wife for not fulfilling them. But this is okay, as she only takes on too much so that she can manipulate him; and without this criticism she'd be unhappy...The most stomach churning part of this book occurs in the section of ""Sexual Games"", namely between fathers and daughters; and how it's apparently natural for the father to covet his daughter, and this is harmless and normal. I just love how he blames this attraction from the father on the mother/wife as she is too frigid to please him, and that's why the father is playing ""uproar"" with his daughter.On a final, frustrated note, the names Berne gives the games are enough to make you want to tear your hair out by the end of the book. They don't really describe the actual ""game"" that's being played, and they just grate when you read them over and over again."

The Parent — Adult — Child model is described in this book, as well as the games people play, rituals, and procedures. Fundamental book about the psychology of people and how we really interact with each other, but, personally for me, it is extremely boringly written, so that I was falling asleep in the middle of reading and my mind was wandering all the time making it impossible for me to concentrate and read it intently 🙈I definitely want to reread this book in the future in order to close the gaps after the first reading :)"

We learn these games from our parents and others around us and pass them down through the generations. All games can be played in various degrees, ranging from social pastimes to deadly serious games which end in 'the courtroom or the morgue'. The games are classified into categories - Life Games, Marital Games, Party Games, Sexual Games, et cetera, and each category contains several sub-games. Each game is specified as a play with various actors, and some of the games finish with a short bit of jargonic analysis. The jargon makes sense if you read the 'Analysis of Games' section, but it's not really all that important anyway, as Berne himself shows by failing to provide this bit for most of the Games he describes. Everybody plays a lot of Games, men and women have their defined roles for the most part although the occasional gender disclaimer is present, and political correctness is still 30 years away. The book is a bit dated but charming, and provides plenty of ammunition for accusing your fellows of pathological behavior. "

But when I started reading the book, it did not take much time to lose interest.Too much of references from the prequel, the writing is unnecessarily complicated, the picture references are confusing.

51,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17465312-s-ren,4,"This was a fascinating and rewarding read, and I highly recommend it, although with significant caveats, see below. The titular games are patterns of behaviour between people which has some short-term benefit for all involved, but almost invariably is counter-productive in the long-term. E.g., the game ""See What You Made Me Do"" (p. 76):White, feeling unsociable, becomes engrossed in some activity which tends to insulate him against people. Perhaps all he wants at the moment is to be left alone. An intruder, such as his wife or one of his children, comes either for stroking or to ask him something like, ‘Where can I find the long-nosed pliers?’ This interruption ‘causes’ his chisel, paintbrush, typewriter or soldering iron to slip, whereupon he turns on the intruder in a rage and cries, ‘See what you made me do.’ This book is fascinating in that some of the games, like ""See What You Made Me Do"", are instantly recognisable and relevant. I am confounded to recognise variations of games from this book in both myself, my colleagues, and my family. It is quite extraordinary that these patterns were so clearly laid out already in 1962—apparently, the strife and character defects I meet (or embody!) in my personal and professional life are neither novel nor particularly interesting. Beyond the excellent descriptions of games, the book present also an analysis founded in a particular branch of psycho-analysis called ""transactional analysis"". In this analysis, motivations and benefits ascribed to players in the book are very much products of its time. I found these 1960'ies era Freudian psycho-analysis explanations mostly ranging from unhelpful to obviously wrong. Here is a particularly egregious example, where the analysis is both insufficiently nuanced, influenced by psycho-analysis, and informed by 1960'ies sexism:As it turned out, however, contrary to her complaints, her hus­band was performing a very real service for her by forbidding her to do something she was deeply afraid of, and by preventing her, in fact, from even becoming aware of her fears. This was one reason her Child had shrewdly chosen such a husband.From a 2020 perspective, this analysis borders on the ridiculous. All the same, it gets some things right: The core is a person using the opinion of another as justification for avoiding doing something she is afraid of. This mechanic does make sense, but you have to disentangle it yourself from the quaint notion of husbands ""forbidding"" wives to do things. However, I found this made for a much more engaging read, requiring me to reflect much more than I might have otherwise.The book is in three sections: an introduction to ""transactional analysis"" and the specific notion of ""game"" used in the book; an extensive collection of descriptions of such games; and a short conclusion indicating what happens once one is free of games. The first part falls in the category of unpersuasive framework and analysis, and I encourage you to only briefly skim it. The writing is generally excellent: concise, clear, cleverly witty; e.g., (p. 80):Almost any game can form the scaffolding for married life and family living, but some, such as ‘If It Weren’t for You’, flourish better or, like ‘Frigid Woman’, are tolerated longer, under the legal force of contractual intimacy.Altogether, I found this book challenging, enjoyable, and enlightening; if you can accept the 1960'ies psycho-analysis sensibilities, I highly recommend it.

52,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,3,"This is not a well-written book, and transactional analysis (the school of psychiatry represented here) has fallen out of fashion. Still, there is a valuable and sound core idea here: people habitually engage in interpersonal interactions with ulterior and explicable motives (""games""), and there are tropes & cliches to these interactions. This book contains an assortment (a laundry list, practically, presented with little comment on the organization) of games observed, inferred, and imagined by the author (and his colleagues).People are supposed to have 3-faceted personalities, with each facet called an ""ego state""; the Parental state is one in which we act out scripts learned from our parents (literal and figurative), and is similar to the superego; the Child state is one in which we recapitulate the naivete of youth, and is similar to the id; the Adult state is a rational and dispassionate character similar to the ego. There are hints of structure to be explored here, as each game roughly corresponds to some interaction between ego states, but no systematic attempt to characterize this correspondence is made.Some of the author's opinions and attitudes are rather badly dated, which can be a little distracting, but for the most part the tone was engaging. All in all, this felt like a weak (but brief, and moderately entertaining) defense of what seems like an interesting idea. I have used, and expect to continue to use use, some of the concepts I learned here in my thinking about human interaction."

Former Alcoholics are preferred because they know how the game goes, and hence are better qualified to play the supporting role than people who have never played before. Cases have been reported of a chapter of A.A. running out of Alcoholics to work on; whereupon the members resumed drinking since there was no other way to continue the game in the absence of people to rescue.""Interesting read, though predictably dated in parts (regarding gender roles, homosexuality, etc.) since it's over half a century old. But despite the passage of time a lot is still frighteningly accurate. The basic premise is that the way we engage in our interpersonal relationships (marriage, sex, work, addictions) are games we inherit from our parents and play to consume idle time and stroke our egos or need for social attention. We are constantly playing the roles and choosing the partners that can best engage in the game with us, even if it is destructive and mostly counter-productive. Many examples are given, and anyone that has been in or around long-term relationships or marriages or codependent families will see the circular logic and hidden motivations for each role.  The only way to really win the game is not to play I think, and try to be aware and enjoy the moment.

With 100 types of these transactions, called “games,” one will be sure to spot how ubiquitous they are in everyday life."
63,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"We need physical and psychological stimuli to survive (stimulus-hunger and recognition-hunger). In other words we need to be 'stroked', literally and figuratively in a social setting.'If you are not stroked, your spinal cord will shrivel up.'The basic unit of a social interactions is this stroke, or otherwise known as a transaction, which is any act that recognises the presence of the other person.We also have a structure-hunger: we need to be doing something, our time needs to be organised in a meaningful way. Material programming occurs when we are faced with the physical demands of the real world. Social programming—the kind Berne is interested in—occurs is scripted or semi-scripted situations called rituals and pastimes. Lastly, there’s individual programming that relies on the underhanded Games or the authentic, true kind of interaction, Intimacy.Before proceeding to describe the different Games people play, Berne introduces some more terminology. In technical, language an ego state may be described phenomenologically as a coherent system of feelings, and operationally as a set of coherent behaviour patterns.Each of us carries three ego states: that of the Child, that of the Adult, and that of the Parent. The Child in you can be either the adapted Child, meaning your behaviour is conditioned by how you were taught to behave when you were little, or the natural Child, meaning your behaviour is spontaneous (the good kind!). Likewise, the Parent can be direct, where you are imitating your parents’ behaviour (you’re doing as you are shown), or indirect, where you are behaving the way they would have wanted you to behave as an adult (you’re doing as you were told, rather than as you were shown).With this terminology, Berne can now begin to describe the analysis of transactions that happen between people.The three states are represented as three touching, but not overlapping circles, sitting on top of each other in a column. When two people interact, transactional analysis puts two of these columns of circles next to each other, in parallel, and can visually depict which ego state in one person is speaking to which ego state in another. It is a pleasing, deceptively simple diagrammatic way of representing complicated social situations where you feel something is going on, but you may never have been quite able to pin down what. Complementary transactions are those that happen back-and-forth (stimulus and response) between two ego states, e.g., Adult-Adult (exchange of factual statements), Adult-Child (pandering to someone’s whim), Parent-Parent (patronising conversation about the inability of a third person to complete a simple task), and so on. Crossed transactions occur when the back-and-forth is not between the same two states. The stimulus is Adult-Adult: e.g., ‘Maybe we should find out why you’ve been drinking more lately,’ or ‘Do you know where my cuff links are?’ The appropriate Adult-Adult response in each case would be: ‘Maybe we should. I’d certainly like to know!’ or ‘On the desk.’ If the respondent flares up, however, the responses will be something like ‘You’re always criticizing me, just like my father did,’ or, ‘You always blame me for everything.’ These are both Child-Parent responses, and as the transactional diagram shows, the vectors cross.’Both complementary and crossed transactions are simple. The other, more pernicious kind, is called ulterior and is subdivided into angular (e.g. Adult-Adult playing at the same time as Adult-Child, as in a salesmen’s tactic) and duplex (e.g. Adult-Adult playing at the same time as Child-Child, as in flirting).And now we come to the Games. They consist of ulterior transactions and Berne classifies the standard scenarios, grouping them into Life Games, Marital Games, Party Games, Sexual Games, Underworld Games, Consulting Room Games, and Good Games (yes, there are some!). The terminology is now burdensome, in fact, Berne makes a point of speaking the way most people can understand his analyses. He makes a point of naming the games in memorable ways, such as ‘Alcoholic', 'Now I’ve Got You, You Son of a Bitch’, ‘Ain’t It Awful’, ‘Rapo’, ‘Cops and Robbers’, etc.Finally, in a rather small section, Berne goes into what would constitute a Game-free interaction. The sombre picture presented in Parts I and II of this book, in which human life is mainly a process of filling in time until the arrival of death, or Santa Claus, with very little choice, if any, of what kind of business one is going to transact during the long wait, is a commonplace but not the final answer. For certain fortunate people there is something which transcends all classifications of behaviour, and that is awareness; something which rises above the programming of the past, and that is spontaneity; and something that is more rewarding than games, and that is intimacy.We can but hope to become fortunate."

77,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19200150-david-roberts,5,"The book I read to research this post was Games People Play by Eric Berne which is an excellent book which I bought from kindle. This book is probably the definitive text on transactional analysis, a form of psychotherapy centred on various roles people play in different situations. If you read this book you are certain to recognize roles you play. Although the book has games in the title it refers to roles and they aren't necessarily bad although some are. They are ways people have of coping with situations and psychologists in their studies have noticed various patterns which make up this form of therapy. One of the main principles in transactional analysis is the roles of persecutor, helper and victim. We all play each of these roles at one time or another and much of our lives is spent going from one to the other. The book also looks at roles like if some people go on a picnic someone with a drink problem might get the others to have one drink of alcohol each and use it to have about 5 drinks himself. The person might not realize he is being manipulative and obviously the cure for this situation is to decline the drink although then he might get abusive. Another situation is when someone gets married they might run up endless debts buying a house and car etc not to mention the wedding and honeymoon. We live in a society that regards things bought on credit as owned when actually the creditor often has the debt secured on them and owns them. In the case of a mortgage the debt lasts for most of that person's working life. It can become the case that person runs into trouble paying it off and can end up with a huge debt and little to show for it especially if the house is sold and covers part of the debt. You can see what I mean about this roles being common place and we all play them. This book is only around 150-200 pages but is really good and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."

79,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15750683-rt-wolf,0,"Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships is a 1964 bestselling book by psychiatrist Eric Berne. Since its publication it has sold more than five million copies. The book describes both functional & dysfunctional social interactions. In the 1st half, he introduces Transactional Analysis as a way of interpreting social interactions. He describes three roles or ego states known as the Child, the Parent & the Adult & postulates that many negative behaviors can be traced to switching or confusion of these roles. He discusses procedures, rituals & pastimes in social behavior, in light of this method of analysis. For example, a boss who talks to his staff as a controlling parent will often engender self-abased obedience, tantrums or other childlike responses from his employees. The 2nd half of the book catalogs a series of games in which people interact thru a patterned & predictable series of transactions which are superficially plausible (that is, they may appear normal to bystanders or even to the people involved), but which actually conceal motivations, include private significance to the parties involved, & lead to a well-defined predictable outcome, usually counterproductive. The book uses “Boy, has he got your number” & other casual phrases as a way of briefly describing each game. Often, the winner of a mind game is the person that returns to the Adult ego-state 1st. Not all interactions or transactions are part of a game. Specifically, if both parties in a one-on-one conversation remain in an Adult ego-state, it's unlikely that a game is being played."
80,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/266762-piezocuttlefish,4,"Games People Play is both meaningful and practical, which easily makes it one of the better self-help books. It teaches a diagnostic ability to identify a game, a bestiary of common games and their antitheses, and highlights the benefits (if briefly, then only perhaps because it is obvius) of game-free living.Berne is candid, jocular, and insightful. I needed to remind myself that Dr. Berne was writing in the 1960s as an experienced therapist, and thus the observations he remarked as a particular game being played primarily by a particular sex, and his predilections toward consigning women to being housewives in his description of games, are mere artefacts of experience without indicating inherent sexism in his ideas. His use of Freudian psychosexual terminology was also disheartening. At times, though, Berne's command of language is delightful (several times I had to look up words which are not to be found on dictionary.com), and I can forgive his use of (now) irrelevant Freudian terminology as a price to pay for the wealth of knowledge in the book.The book was not extremely moving for me (as some non-fiction truly is!), but I did cry a couple times whilst reading about Consulting Room Games, not because I realised I was playing these games, but because the antitheses were telling: they were moves that might well jar me out of my own game-playing behaviour."
81,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,3,"This book was published shortly after I was born, so I grew up hearing references to it. A friend recommended it to me in the 1990s, and I finally got around to reading it. It still contains useful insights into human behavior, but it is heavily influenced by psychoanalysis and, since this was a first edition, it felt very dated. The early '60's use of lingo and ""informal"" titles for the games are extremely off-putting, and, today, are considered sexist.The games, of course, are mental games that individuals—usually understood to be unwell mentally—play to get what they want. There is an almost judgmental air about it. None of this, I suspect, is Berne's fault. The ground has shifted beneath the cool certainties that seemed to operate behind the theories of the early 1960s. Today psychoanalysts often have to defend their approach and human motivations are understood to be more subtle. The importance, however, of describing this in terms of early game theory was the book's stroke of genius.I learned quite a bit from it and I'm sure there are more updated versions of the idea, but this was/is a formative text and reading it was a good exercise. I posted a few more thoughts on it on my blog: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World."
82,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6057240-roberto,4,"This book describes what is now known as transactional analysis, a psychological approach where a lot of relations between people are seen and catalogued as ´games´, which are situations where the conscious communication says something but the unconscious says another. Some or all of the participants gets some ´reward´ as confirmation of inner beliefs, interaction with other people, protection from inner fears, recognition, etc, etc.Besides the unfamiliar description I just gave, Eric Berne, founder of the TA current, does a much better job describing these games, most of them pathologic and some of them constructive. I think most of the people will easily relate to what this book has to say. The situations or games are easily recognizable in our own life and interaction with people, being these relatives, co-workers, public persons and of course ourselves.One plus of the the book that made me think of it as highly useful for daily life, is its constant emphasis in how to counteract the ´bad games´ hence building a very constructive approach.It is an old book already (written in 1964), so you will find some funny anachronisms from that time, but the concept is as fresh when first published.I highly recommend this lecture. It is very entertaining indeed."

It's particularly interesting to see the way that Berne separates out subconscious and conscious motives, and the ways that a single interaction can work differently on different levels. Some of the games felt uncomfortably familiar and distinctly true.While the book still seems insightful and relevant, at least to someone like me who isn't deeply informed about psychiatry, it is badly dated in certain areas. Berne's presentation of some of the games, especially marital and sexual ones, is riddled with the gender prejudices and social assumptions of someone relatively conservative writing in the early 1960s. His brief references to homosexuality in particular show attitudes that will appal many modern readers.Worth reading if you feel that you can take value from the analysis while disregarding the prejudices mentioned above. If not, you should probably find a more modern take on this subject."
86,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28328937-sergii-boiko,4,"To rephrase a famous quote by William Shakespeare - ""The life is a game and all the men and women merely players..."".This book brings to you attention that most of the human interaction is no different from what we usually call ""games"". It has its rules, have rewards and punishment and roles for each players. The most profound roles are Parent, Adult and Child. They are the basis and often don't correlate with an actual age of a person.Getting awareness that your complex pastime is actually a game can help you take it more easy. It gives you freedom to play or not to play. But if you decide to play, you can enjoy it even more.My favorite games from this book are: ""Now I've got you, you son of a bitch!"", ""See what you made you do"", ""Frigid woman"", ""Sweetheart"", ""What don't you - yes but"", ""Let's you and him fight"", ""I'm only trying to help you"", ""Stupid"", ""Wooden Leg"", ""Cavalier"", ""Happy to help"" and ""They'll be glad they knew me"". It doesn't mean that I like to play them particularly, but realizing that they are games, gave me the most insights from this book."
87,0345032799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1658847-andrew,2,"The topic is an important one: social ""games"" that people play with each other - repeated addiction, avenging vindication, extended self-deprecation, sexual provocation, indignant altruism and so on - less-than-genuine patterns that seek minor psychological payoffs.No doubt Berne draws from solid psychiatric experience when describing and classifying these games, but I disliked the psychiatric jargon that pervades the book. It hampered readability, obscured some simple concepts, and the use of Freudian psychosexual development theory made me question how scientific the process was.Berne's work identifying the games is certainly helpful, but I got the sense that an astute, untrained individual would be capable identifying most of them. In that sense, this book feels more like a compendium than an analytic treatise. Perhaps it is more directly useful in therapy, where encyclopedic knowledge of the games is more necessary."

This is a book that I read a while ago and a lot of it has stuck with me. First published in 1964, the writer assumes you have no grounding in psychology and takes you gently through the various ego states that we speak to each other on - Child, Adult and Parent, and then describes the ""Games"" that we subconciously play with each other.A real eye opener and a great way to avoid argument and conflict. Of course it is a lot easier to spot these games and faults in others but if you could stand back and see them in yourself (I can't) then life would be a lot easier.Strictly to be avoided in the heat of an argument is the analysis to your partner along the lines of ""You see, I am speaking to you on an adult ego plane whereas your Child answer........""A heavy book for holiday reading, a good read for those in management, especially project or people management."
