To that last end, I found the chapter on Johnny Appleseed very enlightening as well as highly entertaining. Michael Pollan is more humorous and, let's just say, more adventurous than one might expect from a journalist/botanist (see his passages on hallucinogenic plants.) I appreciate his willingness to ""go first"" in the same way I tip my hat to daring bastard who first tried, say, lobster. I assume it went down like this: ""What's this? A giant, saltwater, armor-clad cockroach? Definitely looks poisonous....Fuck it, I'm hungry."" Trying new, unknown food must have been done on a dare or at least with starvation lurking close at-hand. Farmers on any scale will enjoy and find use in The Botany of Desire. As a pallid yellow-thumb aspiring to green, I know I learned a few things. For one, I've finally transitioned over to organic apples. I don't know who would eat another kind after reading this book. Why with the chemicals already?! Good lord!"

Growing up, my father regularly told me the same thing. Once when walking home from school on a windy day, a large branch fell on me, striking my shoulder and knocking me to the ground. Since my collar bone was not broken, I got up and walked home. When I told my father what happened, he said,""Of course. The trees are always hoping we'll drop dead. This one was just a bit more aggressive about it.""CARMEN: o.OPAPI: ""Trees are always hoping that the humans or animals walking by will drop dead. That way they will have a tasty snack.""I've never forgotten what my father told me. He was halfway serious in these remarks, and I take them halfway seriously, too. Even though I've seen tons of ""stupid"" or ""silly"" horror films which dream up scenarios in which ""plants are trying to kill us!,"" there is an undercurrent of truth in the notion that, in a way, plants are very evolved organisms, much more evolved than humans themselves. Who can say what their true intentions are? (I'm only half-joking, here.)Despite the rather ""hokey horror film"" premise of Pollan's introduction, the book is a smart yet entertaining look at plants and their history of coevolution and codependence with human beings.The book is divided into four parts.1.) APPLES. This is a very interesting portion of the book. A lot of focus is on Johnny Appleseed. We also get some fascinating discussions of religion.There was an old tradition in northern Europe linking the grape, which flourished all through Latin Christendom, with the corruptions of the Catholic Church, while casting the apple as the wholesome fruit of Protestantism. Wine figured in the Eucharist; also, the Old Testament warned against the temptations of the grape. But the Bible didn't have a bad word to say about the apple or even the strong drink that could be made from it. Even the most God-fearing Puritan could persuade himself that cider had been given a theological free pass.2.) TULIPS. This section was hella boring. I was bored out of my skull. Ugh. SO BORING.3.) MARIJUANA. This was a fascinating section about drugs, Pollan's experiences growing and smoking pot, and why plants that alter human consciousness could be a good thing.We also get gems like this:[Witches'] potion recipes called for such things as datura, opium poppies, belladonna, hashish, fly-agaric mushrooms, and the skins of toads. These ingredients would be combined in a hempseed-oil-based ""flying ointment"" that the witches would then administer vaginally using a special dildo. This was the ""broomstick"" by which these women were said to travel.Pollan posits that many of our philosophies and our religions come from the influence of drugs. There's a lot of research to back him up, which I won't go into here.4.) POTATO. This was interesting because Pollan discusses the Potato Famine and also GMO potatoes. He even grows some GMO potatoes himself in his garden as an experiment. Blah blah blah food industry blah blah blah monoculture blah blah blah....Tl;dr - 3 out of 4 ain't bad. The mindnumbing tulip section stops this from being a 5-star book, but I think this is a better book than the only other Pollan book I've read: Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, in which Pollan comes off as a rather entitled and condescending wealthy person. There's not much of that here, Pollan is much more relatable in this book, perhaps because he's not trying to tell people what to eat and how to live their lives.Wow, Carmen, bitter much?I call it how I see it! :pThis book has so much information and interesting thinking points that I think it is definitely worth reading for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the topics presented here. I was surprised the book was so good. I'm impressed."

He is an amazing, amazing writer: he makes me want to plant a garden, to tour his garden (his bedroom? what?), to only eat organic food, and to find out the story and origin of every morsel of food I put in my body. But he does it in a way that isn't overly preachy or agenda-driven. Instead, he lets you get what he is saying while at the same time telling an engaging, well-researched story, both personal and historic, and one that made me want to read quickly to the very end. I took many a too-long lunch break because I was so hooked. "
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,4,"The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World by Michael Pollan introduces the possibility to the reader that plants are using insects, animals and humans to ensure their own survival. An interesting book about the symbiosis between all living organism and how Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory of natural selection is happening. 
In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires—sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control—with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind’s most basic yearnings. And just as we’ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?
What the author did in the book is to address the hybridizing of plant species to fit our needs. Although domesticated plants have been multiplied at a much greater rate than in nature, they also stand to disappear due to over-hybridization. This is highlighted in this book.Hail to Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers! How plants manipulate us, as well as animals and insects are riveting reading for sure. But how we domesticated plants, and the consequences of our own actions, are much more disturbing. Watch this documentary for a fascinating insight into this part of plant behaviour. The information in this document is much more detailed than the book and one is of my favorites. If you watched this documentary, you will get a much better idea of how it works.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-4w5...It is indeed a mysterious world to get involved in, even if you only want to read about it. Plants have souls and feelings. That's the bottomline! :-))There so many anecdotes I can share concerning the interaction between plants, animals, insects and humans, that it will require a book to do so. So I will unhappily sit on my hands and just allow the urge pass me by for now! :-))You probably will have to read the book, yes, definitely read the book. It's a great start. The author approached his subject with sensitivity and great care.OKAY ...... IT'S SOAP BOX TIME!!!One comment in the book made me sit up straight. Had me hackles raised. :-) It's losing a star as a result.I've sent an excerpt of the book to 30 botanist friends from all over the world, who worked with me on an international DNA project of the natural flora in our country, and just loved the reactions. Serious researchers, doing their jobs for decades, could not believe this assumption made in the book:
According to Jack Goody, an English anthropologist ...who has studied the role of flowers in most of the world’s cultures—East and West, past and present—the love of flowers is almost, but not quite, universal. The “not quite” refers to Africa, where, Goody writes in 'The Culture of Flowers', flowers play almost no part in religious observance or everyday social ritual. (The exceptions are those parts of Africa that came into early contact with other civilizations—the Islamic north, for example.) Africans seldom grow domesticated flowers, and flower imagery seldom shows up in African art or religion. Apparently when Africans speak or write about flowers, it is usually with an eye to the promise of fruit rather than the thing itself.
 That is certainly an interesting, and true statement. However, the next paragraph had us all gasping for air. Dumbfounded!
 ... the ecology of Africa doesn’t offer a lot of flowers, or at least not a lot of showy ones. Relatively few of the world’s domesticated flowers have come from Africa, and the range of flower species on the continent is nowhere near as extensive as it is in, say, Asia or even North America. What flowers one does encounter on the savanna, for example, tend to bloom briefly and then vanish for the duration of the dry season.
My first thought was that an anthropologist won't know that more than 80% of the ± 2400 Pelargonium species originate in southern Africa; numerous orchards, too many to list here, horde of proteas, ericas, lilies, flowering trees, and hundreds of highly sought-after succulents come from dear mother Africa. Some of the international well-known botanists' comments (which can be shared publicly, the rest is unpublishable!) : -- ""I read that piece. It is nonsense."" -- ""Badly written and poorly researched is my comment!""-- ""Africa is the best at all things natural, most especially flowers. I think they are also missing that flowers are attached to plants and we Africans have been more interested in the other parts as they hold the goodies that cure us of almost any illness. We used the flowers to help us get to the right plant. It has been so tied up in African culture that it is magical and mysterious – sangoma style – so the knowledge never made it into books."" -- ""We laugh at this book from a dizzy height!""Nevertheless, let's leave it at that. Michael Pollan concentrates on four domesticated plants and their uses to humans. The philosophy, history, and huge impact the plants had on human survival is discussed with a focus on the uses which satisfied mankind's four basic needs: sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control. He confirms why it has become highly essential to preserve the original plant species in nature. The more plants are altered, the less chance there is of the species to survive-a dangerous situation for both this planet and mankind. Hybridization also happens in nature. For instance, bees pollinate a different variety of one species with the result of new species developing from it. Crassulas, in nature, is a prime example of this. So many cross-breeds develop that it is a headache for botanists to identify those species correctly. Most people in the world are not aware of the huge challenges facing global food production. More than 60% of the world's population currently reside in cities, with little or no access to land. Countries, such as Japan, have already began to expand vertically, and not horizontally. A complete city, providing housing, schools, hospital and shopping areas are provided in high-rise buildings. There is simply not enough space horizontally anymore to expand. Another current trend worldwide is for people to move out of suburbs into inner cities again. It is predicted that suburbs will become the future slums. Highways, the cost of vehicles, fuel and traffic congestion, the decline in oil resources, are discouraging the future development of more suburbs. Many boarded-up or abandoned houses can be found everywhere. Huge inner slums and squatter camps are popping up all over the world as a result of uncontrolled population growth, unemployment, job losses and lack of job opportunities. Urban people are more and more unable to propagate their own food. Add to that the limited areas suitable for agriculture in the world, with limited water resources, and the picture becomes a little more complicated. While the world's human population increases at an alarming rate, the agricultural land to produce food for the masses do not. As a result it was necessary to develop plants that could produce more fruits on the same parcel of land and have new possibilities to protect themselves against water restrictions and pests. Extended families do not manage farms anymore. Farmers are forced to mechanize, which is not only expensive, but also detrimental to oil resources in the world. A staggering number of farmers are leaving the industry annually due to the high costs and low profits (or no profits) in food production.In hybridization, and the very expensive research to accomplish the outcomes, different plants are used to cross-breed in order to address the challenges. For instance, the DNA of one plant which has a natural defense against pests are bred with another plant which do not have the ability. My husband produced hybridized seeds of tomatoes which produced uniform color and fruit size and had a longer shelf life. I cannot name the company who sponsored it (not Monsanto), but can mention that a cantaloupe gene was used to accomplish this - another edible fruit. In pumpkin hybrids two different varieties were used to produce a uniform, round pumpkin which which was smaller in size and could fit into a shopping bag so that the consumer could handle it.  The author mentions an incident he read about in which the DNA of fireflies were added to tobacco plants! My philosophy is: if you haven't seen it with your own eyes, don't spread the story! I almost lost interest in this book after reading that. However, the author made the effort to visit the research facilities of the Monsanto company, interviewed farmers, and made an effort to understand what is recently done to increase food production and the methods that is used. He states that unrelated species in nature cannot be crossed. But then alleges that Monsanto crossed that barrier. ""Nature"", he says, ""exercise a kind of veto over what culture can do with a potato."" Donkeys and horses were cross-bred, but the resulting animal were sterile. That's a fact in nature. I agree with the author's statement: 
All domesticated plants are in some sense artifical, living archives of both cultural and natural information that people have helped to ""design"". Any given type of potato reflects the human desires that have been bred into it.
There is sadly not enough space left on earth to allow people each a piece of land and enough water to produce their own food. We cannot go back to wearing natural fibers, since there are not enough grazing or space, once again, to keep the animals on that land which will produce those needed fibers. That's the bottom line. Too many people, too little natural resources. For instance, if we allow 7 billion people to strip mine plants in trying to return to natural medicines, there will be nothing left of nature. It is therefore essential that everything we use be produced commercially in particular agricultural zones all over the world, and to protect natural fauna and flora in designated protected zones. We have to hybridize to survive as the human race. For the past seventy years it has become necessary and the challenge will be bigger in future. Humans are already dependent on it and there's no way out of it. If you are fortunate enough to have space for your own fruit and vegetable garden, make use of it to plant your own food. Use vintage seed and go organic, since you do not have to produce masses of fruits and vegetables for billions of people living in urban areas with limited space. Organic farming is labor intensive. Commercial farmers do not have enough labor resources to do the same.The good news is that more and more commercial farmers are moving away from monocultural farming, with more involvement in the agronomic side of soil management. Biodiversity is making a comeback.In the end, it is obvious from the discussions in the book, why Africa is still the cradle of mankind. Not mentioned in the book, it is just my own reaction. In Africa, people did not 'listen' to the flowers to spread them in unnatural selections. Africans had a vast knowledge of the value of plants in their natural state, for thousands of years, used it for various purposes, still do, but allowed the plants to remain part of the natural biodiversity around them. In fact, should an apocalypse hit this planet, it will be the people who respected the natural laws, who would survive. And that will be the Africans, most probably. They did not change nature, and lived in harmony with it all their lives. The message I take from the book, as an African and naturalist, is that my continent knew what they were doing when they left nature alone. Perhaps they were not left behind, they were in fact far ahead in time! Oh well, it is something to think about, at least. I enjoyed the book and recommend it for sure. Sometimes there are fairy tales in real life. Just listen to the flowers!"

5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"In East Asian cultures – according to my increasingly Japanese daughters – the number four brings bad luck. This is because it sounds a bit like the word for death. Clearly the number four has no such associations for Michael Pollan. The Omnivore’s Dilemma is based around four meals and this one is based around four plants. I’ve done more than just enjoy these two books, they have completely enchanted me whilst also informing me and keeping me greatly amused.Now, desire sounds like a strong word to use about botany. There is, of course, that Frank Zappa song Call Any Vegetable and it will respond to you – I think this is also the song which ends with the memorable line, “O what a pumpkin!”Now that isn’t quite the desire Pollan is talking about here. His four plants are: the apple, the tulip, marijuana and the potato. As a one time Irishman I have no problem with the idea that the potato might make the list of plants of desire, but I can see that others might struggle most with that one being included.This book is based on the idea that plants use us as much as we use them – and the plants best able to meet our desires are the plants we help most to spread about the world. So much so that we tend to make monocultures of those plants that best match our desires – something that is arguably as much a problem for the plants as it is a boon for them.Do you know when you sort of know the story to something, even if you don’t quite know the details? I had that kind of relationship with the story of Johnny Appleseed (aka John Chapman). While I had some notion of him going around frontier America planting apple seeds (and ten points for promoting dental health) he was never really going to cut it beside, say, Daniel Boone (what a dream come-er-true-er was he!). Little did I know that rather than being a man dedicated to the random distribution of apple seeds, he actually sold apple trees to pioneers (when not considering matrimony with stray 10 year olds). Pioneers were keen to buy the said apple trees not due to the dearth of doctors being kept away by all those apples being eaten, but rather the equally troubling shortage of bartenders. Apples being as good a way as any to make a pleasant alcoholic drink – and one that wasn’t complained about in the Bible. It is here that Pollan develops one of his major metaphors – borrowed from Nietzsche (that most popular of masturbatory German philosophers) of the dichotomy between the Apollonian and the Dionysian. I’ve generally found this to be one of the more lucid and intelligent things Nietzsche ever said and so wasn’t disappointed that so much time was devoted to this idea in this book. Basically, Apollo was the god of order and light, Dionysus the god of wine and orgies. Our obsession with growing the same potato all over the world to make the perfect McDonalds fry is symbolic of the Apollonian desire – Johnny Appleseed growing apple trees from seed and thereby getting a vast number of genetically different trees symbolic of the Dionysian.This central tension forms a large part of the basis of the book. It proves an interesting thing to say about Tulips too, and obviously also of marijuana. I guess it is possible that if Dionysus was with us today he might well be a pot head. The stuff about marijuana is very interesting. Particularly the fact that it has become about 10 times more potent over the years and that this increase in potency is directly attributable to the ‘war on drugs’. Pollan makes an interesting case for the idea that if the US government hadn’t spent billions of dollars imprisoning its citizens and fighting a war it could never win, pot would still be coming into the States from Mexico and would not have been bred up to being the super drug it is today. Pollan says that his initial reaction to smoking pot was much the same as mine has always been. That its main effects seemed to be to make me feel paranoid and stupid. Having been brought up in the loony left I really didn’t need chemistry to help me be paranoid, or stupid, for that matter. Apparently, this is because on the rare occasions when I did smoke pot I was smoking ‘blue collar’ marijuana. Which is probably for the best.Again, as with the apples and the tulips, I did know much of the story of marijuana before I started reading, but not really all of the details. The story of tulips causing a major economic bubble is worth reflecting on at the moment. The plants themselves are equally fascinating, as are little facts gleaned along the way about depression and plant viruses.But the section on the potato is riveting – and not just for the Irish. This is similar to the first section of The Omnivore’s Dilemma on corn. We really are going to have to do something about the way we produce food – and if you need to know why, then reading this chapter will make it all clear. If the only way we can grow potatoes for McDonald’s fries is to kill the planet then perhaps (and this is just a suggestion) we shouldn’t be eating McDonald’s fries.I think I liked The Omnivore’s Dilemma better than this one, but really, they were both fascinating and well worth the read."
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"This is a marvellous book, which discusses the science, sociology, aesthetics and culture, relating to four plants.ApplesTulipsMarijuanaPotatoesBecause of who I am, the things that interested me most were the tulip and potato sections.With the first, he discusses the notorious obsession surrounding tulip cultivation in Holland in the 17th century. With the second he discusses a genetically modified potato which was on sale in the US at the time he wrote the book, in 2001. The potato is a variety called NewLeaf. This is no longer a product being promoted by the company which produces the seeds for it (Monsanto of course), but what the author has to say about it is still very relevant with regard to current and future vegetable research. It has left me feeling a lot less blazé about GM vegetables and monocultures. This may be the only way forward if we are to feed the vast number of people on this planet, but it comes at a price - and that price may be largely unknown. In contrast to the huge vegetable factory-type farming discussed in most of this section, Pollan also visits an organic farmer, and the difference hits you big time. Everything about the factory farms are so alien, and brutal in their approach, (they seemingly use anything they can to get the most produce for the least bucks); and everything about the organic farm is so much more harmonious, and working respectfully with nature. Interestingly the main factory-type vegetable farmer he spoke to, also grows organic vegetables, but just for him and his family's consumption. Go figure.He also fairly briefly discusses the horrors of the Irish Potato Famine between 1845 and 1852, and that too was extremely interesting.And now on to matters of the heart. The section on tulips in the 17th century was a great pleasure to read. Here I am just going to type a few chunks out of the book, (some rather chopped about I'm afraid) for those of you who fancy a brief excursion into a time of passion, madness and decadence.(view spoiler)[
  Tulip mania in Holland reached its peak between 1634 and 1637.The queen of all tulips was Semper Augustus. ""Generally regarded at the time as the most beautiful flower in the world. In 1624 there were only a dozen or so specimens, most of them owned by Dr. Adriaen Pauw.This was the intricately-feathered red and white tulip - one bulb of which could change hands for 10,000 guilders at the height of the mania, a sum that would have bought one of the grandest canal houses in Amsterdam. It is now gone from nature. But I have seen paintings of it (the Dutch would commission portraits of venerable tulips they couldn't afford to buy.) Beside a Semper Augustus a modern tulip looks like a toy.A tulip that falls out of favour soon goes extinct. Generally a strain won't last unless it is regularly replanted, so the chain of genetic continuity can be broken in a generation. Even when people do continue to plant a particular tulip, the vigour of that variety (which is propagated by removing and planting the bulb's ""offsets"", the little genetically identical bulblets that form at its base) eventually fades and must be abandoned...... Tulips, in other words, are mortal.No tulip appears in the flower-crowded borders of medieval tapestries, nor is the flower ever mentioned in the early 'herbals' - the Old World encyclopedias of the world's known plants and their uses. The fierceness of the passion that the tulip unleashed in Holland in the seventeenth century (and to a lesser extent in France and England) may have had something to do with the flower's novelty in the west, and the suddenness of its appearance. It is the youngest of our canonical flowers. Ogier Ghislain De Busbecq, an Austrian, claimed to have introduced the first tulip to Europe, sending a consignment of bulbs from Constantinople in 1554. (The word 'tulip' is a corruption of the Turkish word for 'turban'.)Tulips, like apples, do not come true from seed - which accounts for the astonishing variety it can produce.....though it takes 7 years before a tulip grown from seed flowers and shows its new colours.(In seventeenth century Holland) botany became a national pastime, followed as closely and avidly as we follow sports today.Land in Holland being so scarce and expensive, Dutch gardens were miniatures, measured in square feet rather than acres and frequently augmented with mirrors. The Dutch thought of their gardens as jewel boxes, and in such a space even a single flower...could make a powerful statement.What the Dutch really sought were 'broken' tulips, these were flowers where you get a white or yellow ground, with intricate feathers or flames of a vividly contrasting hue.In the 1920s the electron microscope was invented, and scientists discovered that the virus causing broken tulips was spread by myzus persicae, the peach potato aphid. Peach trees were common in seventeenth century gardens. By the 1920s the Dutch regarded their tulips as commodities to trade...and since the virus weakened the bulbs it infected (the offsets of a 'broken' tulip were small and few in number), Dutch growers set about ridding their fields of the infection.There was another Dutch obsession - a quest that has gone on for 400 years - the quest for a black tulip. Today we have 'Queen of the Night' - a dark, glossy maroonish purple. Breeders today are busily seeking a new black tulip because they know that this current standard bearer is probably on her way out. Alexandre Dumas wrote a novel 'The Black Tulip' (in 1850) based on this search.""

From the jacket copy and reviews I'd read, I'd come to expect a poetic lay-science book about the entwined destinies of plants and humans. Hell, that's what the author's introduction led me to expect, too.I did not expect, nor want, most of the chapter on the apple to be more concerned about the historical realities of Johnny Appleseed than with the apple itself. I didn't want the author to neglect almost the whole history of the fruit before 1776, by virtue, apparently, of being too lazy to do more than pay lip service to anything that didn't happen in America. If I hear one more cute little musing about Johnny Appleseed, I will start seriously considering not listening to this book anymore....I hope the damned thing gets more interesting in the next chapter, that's all I'm saying. But I don't have very high hopes.(Updated: I don't think I ever even finished the dratted thing.)"

Pollan removes the veil between apples, tulips, marijuana, potatoes, and mankind in order to illustrate how the plants evolved and what kinds of shenanigans they've brought on civilization in the process.""Our grammar might teach us to divide the world into active subjects and passive objects, but in a coevolutionary relationship every subject is also an object, every object a subject. That's why it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""My favorite chapter was about the tulips. Did you know at one point in the Dutch Republic a tulip bulb cost as much as a house? It was called ""tulipmania"" and it caused enormous havoc in the local economy when the tulip bubble burst.I also learned about the evolution of flowers, which I didn't know anything about before reading this. I had only ever considered them from a spiritual perspective — I think it was Eckhart Tolle who talked about flowers being the ""spiritual evolution of plants"". It's rather interesting actually if you're into that kind of thing.""But I do wonder if it isn't significant that our experience of flowers is so deeply drenched in our sense of time. Maybe there's a good reason we find their fleetingness so piercing, can scarcely look at a flower in bloom without thinking ahead, whether in hope or regret.Pollan's writing style wanders no where quickly, so readers who have little patience for storytelling non-fiction may want to choose a different book. I rather liked it.I think he may have oversimplified the plants and humanity relationship by picking only one motivating desire per plant. Let's be real, things are never as simple as that. But for the premise of this book, it worked well enough.Basically, The Botany of Desire encourages readers to consider what plants get from us as much as what we get from them. It's a different perspective, like looking at your home from the level of a toddler rather than your usual height. There's things to learn and puzzle out and discover that you may have never even imagined.Recommended for readers interested in botany and different worldviews."

Very long, repetitious, & kept wandering into pseudoscientific philosophy. As well as Scott Brick read this, it was incredibly boring listening to the same points for half an hour, so I quit. Yes, it is interesting to contemplate whether we domesticated a plant or it domesticated us. The evolutionary imperative of any organism is to spread copies of its DNA. Yuval Noah Harari mentioned it in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind a decade later - 'mentioned' being the operative word. That's all it's worth. It is a koan, a philosophical riddle that can mean many things depending on the observer.The history & mechanisms of co-evolution are interesting, too. However, his assertion that plants are almost mystically so wonderful at biochemistry is ridiculous. Biochemically, bacteria & venomous critters can be just as weird as plants. We're no slouches ourselves in our ability to break down wide varieties of materials to feed ourselves. The idea that a strain of cannabis can get us high seems less strange to me than a mere fungus, yeast, doing everything from getting us high to making bread rise & even insulin to treat diabetes.Anyway, I was looking for a scientific & historical book, not sophomoric philosophy."

His tone and his command of the various histories managed to make his writing both personal and wildly interesting.I'm speaking of Apples, Tulips, Cannabis, and Potatoes, however.I'll assume that everyone has had apples and potatoes, but I can also assume that everyone is at least AWARE of cannabis. As for tulips, they once caused rather fascinating Dionysian meltdown among the Dutch. Toppled a kingdom. That's pretty heavy. :)The real history of Johnny Appleseed might very well have been about apple alcohol. Cider. But once upon a time, and thanks to the wildly diverse possibilities within the apple seed, the whole nation had thousands of different kinds of apples. People selected and bred the best and all of a sudden this nearly unique source of sweetness (sugar being either rare or distasteful thanks to the slave trade) made apples more than a huge market. Sweetness was the key, but when other foods replaced the apple's kingship of sweetness, by that time, the amazing variety had been reduced to a mere handful.It was our desire for the apples that caused this domestication, but beyond that, the apple trees themselves found themselves in a paradise of genetic dispersion, so helped it along. Selective breeding programs have been a real thing for a long time.Tulips, for their beauty and a sometimes erratic explosion of color (thanks to a virus that made it weaker) became a craze of economic speculation, driving the prices up until it bankrupted a kingdom. Cannabis, also a victim or a happy co-author of selective breeding, has undergone massive changes as well. Maybe it was the prohibition against it that made it so coveted, but this is almost as crazy as the Tulip economic bubble.Potatoes, the last chapter, is all about control. Monsanto. If you like to be freaked out and get the skinny on that debate (as of 2001, when this was published) I can promise you that it will do the job nicely. The kinds of things that are done today with pesticides, GMOs, and the forced termination of genes in order to force farmers to come back, repeatedly, to Monsanto, is a tragedy of epic proportions. And then there's the comparison of this mono-gene-culture to the one that starved a million people in the Potato Famine in Ireland, driving away half the population because they could no longer feed themselves.Can something like that happen to us?It's the big question. We're doing it to ourselves. Our need for perfect french fries may undo us all."

Well, I was kind of familiar with marijuana's development (not from personal toking, honest Asian, but from being surrounded by tokers - hey, it was Oregon) and that it was completely villified in the ""just say no"" era of drug awareness education. The chapters on the apple, tulip, and potato offer cautionary evidence on the danger of destroying diversity in the name of commerce. Dratted industry and their shipping lives, appearance over taste, money over environmental responsibility; dratted consumers and our being trapped in busy schedules, cheap produce, the quick&easy, the short range.Even though I'm probably being manipulated by the plants, I still want a garden in which to spread their genetic material. Plant pimp? If only.On the subject of plants causing us to help them multiply by being appealing to us: I view this language as couching the concept in terms that we might understand, finding a common thread and expounding. I don't imagine Mr. Pollan meant plants as willfully selecting the characteristics that would cause us to replant and increase year after year. It's supposed to be a mutually beneficial interaction. If they could effect deliberate change in us, would they let us spray potatoes like that or make the mealy Red Delicious, I'm sure it was once actually delicious, the most common apple in US supermarkets? I wonder what it would be like if plants could fight us. Or maybe our dependence on the few varieties that now have weaknesses engendered by continuous cloning/inbreeding will result in a plant-revenge."

This was another museum book club pick from our Minneapolis Institute of Art; while I like Michael Pollan it's unlikely I would have otherwise read this fascinating book. Even the description made it look doubtful that it would be my cup of tea. Boy, was I wrong!Pollan looks at four human desires and four plants that satisfy those desires to explore the interdependence of humans and plants. The desires/plants are Sweet/Apple, Beauty/Tulip, Intoxication/Cannabis and Control/Potato. He busts the myth of Johnny Appleseed, shows how Tulipomania was the tech bubble of 17th century Dutch society, tells how cannabis produces the crystal clarity experienced by users and how it's different from others drugs and illustrates the historical folly of man's quest to industrialize food production by creating botanical mono-cultures. My hunch is after reading this you will never eat a commercially grown potato again!Pollan concludes that while humans believe in our ultimate control over plants, plants have equal influence on the destiny of mankind.

An example of the later is quoted below:""For look into a flower, and what do you see? Into the very heart of nature's double nature--that is, the contending energies of creation and dissolution, the spring toward complex form and the tidal pull away from it. Apollo and Dionysus were names the Greeks gave to these two faces of nature, and nowhere in nature is their contest as plain or as poignant as it is in the beauty of a flower and its rapid passing. There, the achievement of order against all odds and its blithe abandonment. There, the perfection of art and the blind flux of nature. There, somehow, both transcendence and necessity. Could that be it--right there, in a flower--the meaning of life?""By the time a reader has finished this book they'll know more about apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes than ever before. And along the way perhaps the reader will have picked up a slightly enhanced understanding the interaction of humans and plant life. And as indicated in the quote above, they will be introduced to the author's possible insight into the meaning of life. Every topic in this book was subjected to the Apollo vs. Dionysus analysis somewhere along the line.In the section on marijuana the author provides a detailed description of what it means in terms of neurochemistry to be high on marijuana. This information was new to me. I got the impression this subject has not been fully researched and there still remains some speculation in the descriptions. He did make the definitive statement that nobody has ever died from an overdose of THC (active ingredient in marijuana). That certainly cannot be said for alcohol. So why is alcohol legal and marijuana outlawed? They both can pose a danger to society if misused, but one is publicly advertised with the caveat, ""Please drink responsibly."" The other is a crime to possess or use. Surely there's no rational basis for this difference.The last section on the potato came down pretty hard on genetically engineered plants. I am not as emotionally opposed to this science as some appear to be. I'm in favor of asking questions and looking for problems that may arise. But I'm willing to eat genetically engineered food in the meantime. I figure that if we wait to be absolutely sure of no adverse consequences before using advances in science, all scientific and technological advances will cease. My hat is off to Michael Pollan for being able to write an interesting narrative around rather ordinary topics. He has the skills of a talented story teller to combine historical and scientific facts with tales of his own personal adventures and interviews with other people. I had to give the book five stars because, quite frankly, I found it to be an enjoyable and interesting book.Here's a short review of this book from my PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THE APPLE TREE’S DILEMMA“Without flowers, the reptiles, which had gotten along fine in a leafy, fruitless world, would probably still rule. Without flowers, we would not be,” writes Michael Pollan in his absolutely engaging book on the way plants and humans have lived and evolved together. His method is similar to that in The Omnivore’s Dilemma, in that he takes four plants—apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes—and gives us their perspective on the complex relationship between plants and humans.

18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"What a wonderful book!Desire. There are many forms of it. It can be a food craving, it can be sexual between two of the same species, it can be the need to possess something, …But what does all that have to do with botany? Well, humans aren’t the only ones wanting something. Plants, like any other life form on this planet, have desires too. The desire to spread and multiply for example.Not to mention that beings can use another’s desire for their own advantage.We have lived with plants for a long time. We need them and they, to some degree, need us. Would they be able to survive without humans? Absolutely. Because they’ve learnt to use other creatures (mammals as well as birds and insects) as well.But who is domesticating who here?In four chapters, the author examines four different kinds of desire represented by four different kinds of plants: sweetness as represented by the apple, beauty as represented by the tulip, intoxication as represented by cannabis and control as represented by the potato.Thus, we discuss anything from how today’s varieties of apples are grown and cultivated (no, planting a seed from your favorite apple isn’t gonna get you anywhere, I’m afraid), to how the tulip became more valuable than gold in the Netherlands in the 17th century and how something as (seemingly) unimportant as beauty was also a great commodity, to the biology of intoxication and plants’ evolution to either kill or manipulate the brains of their consumers, to the cultivation / genetic manipulation of food like the potato and Monsanto’s impact on today’s farming industry.We learn a lot about evolution and history, but also about politics and man’s need to dominate his world. Some of these stories (like that of Johnny Appleseed) are quirky or downright funny, others are fascinating. I knew much about apples and tulips but learned a lot about cannabis (from the transformation of the political landscape surrounding this mild drug to why plants use this kind of effect as a way to ensure we keep cultivating and even spreading it, to say nothing about the intoxication of animals). The last chapter was my least favourite one. That is not to say that it was bad. It was just that I already know how bad Monsanto is (not even necessarily morally but because of the spread of mono-cultures and limiting new forms from evolving / being invented) as well as genetic modifications to pesticides as much as the food plants themselves and the impact this has on the wilderness. I also know how crazy some food standards are (the best example was the requirements for french fries the author spoke about) and this makes the topic the most depressing of the four. *lol* A holistic but quite unique view at plants and our relationship with them. I loved how he included everything from biology, chemistry and history to politics and (human as well as animal) psychology.Last but not least, the writing style was also highly … addictive. *lol* Seriously, I always say that the key to non-fiction becoming more popular is having more authors who can break down complex topics in nice ways without dumbing any given subject down too much and being eloquent in a way that holds the readers’ attention. In this case, I guarantee you’ll even be enthusiastic!"
19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,4,"Pollan represents one of my favorite types of writers: modern polymaths who can bring scientific, historic and literary knowledge to bear on whatever they're writing about. When it's done well, I don't care what the question is; for instance, tulips aren't really my thing, despite their presence on my dining room table right now. The conversation between history, literature and science really interests me, though, which is why nearly all of the books I read fall into one of those categories.(That's sortof a joke.)But I couldn't get into the first half of Botany of Desire, and the reason is that the book is padded. I've been curious about the reality behind the Johnny Appleseed legend, so it's terrific that he delved into it - but it would have made a great ten-page essay. Pollan stretches it for nearly 60 pages. He repeats himself (a lot); he circles around; he includes details about people he's met that are irrelevant and not all that interesting.So far, so three star book.The section on pot, though, gets hilariously loopier. Halfway through this chapter - after an interesting history of what the War on Drugs has done for pot, and right at the point where, in other chapters, he would have started to repeat himself - he instead ends up in Amsterdam, trying the new breeds of pot for the first time, apparently, in years, and the rest of the chapter is one long, adoring love letter to the glories of weed, written while ecstatically baked. Non-pot-fans might find this chapter less endearing than I did, but for me, as a casual fan of the drug and, more importantly, as a guy who finds the question of what mind-altering drugs do for us interesting, it was the best part of the book. Too bad he still can't get past the slightly apologetic tone most grown-ups who still smoke pot feel forced to adopt - why not just mention it matter-of-factly as a normal thing many people do? That is, after all, what it is. But still. Fun stuff.The final chapter on potatoes contains some of the usual ""Holy shit, we have no idea what we're doing"" stuff on genetic engineering, and there's a ""sky is falling"" feel to it that made me roll my eyes, but his take on in it is interesting enough. I dug this book."

In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires—sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control—with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind’s most basic yearnings. And just as we’ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?Read by Scott BrickFirst up is the apple, John Chapman aka Johnny Appleseed aka the American Dionysus.

21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,3,"A brief but compelling history of four plants whose genetic destiny has been markedly altered by man – the apple, the tulip, cannabis, and the potato. Pollan’s argument is that, though we see domestication as a strictly top-down, subject-to-object process, there really may also be some co-evolutionary force at work. Johnny Appleseed’s efforts were to the overwhelming advantage of apple genetic proliferation, and the science of mass potato farming means more seeds are planted every year. But we’ll get to the argument bit in a minute.As quirky, offbeat history, this is fabulous. It turns out botany is an incredibly versatile vehicle in which to travel from social psychology to religion to bioethics. Pollan makes fascinating detours through early American advertising schemes, pauses briefly to describe the hallucinogenic mixture of mushrooms and opium European witches would administer via dildo, and then hops blithely on to the cost-benefit economics of potato plants engineered to make their own pesticide. It’s a wonderfully engaging trip, made all the more so by Pollan’s lucid, thoughtful, frankly lovely writing. I haven’t enjoyed a spot of nonfiction prose on a purely esthetic level in a long time, and for that pleasure alone I could recommend this book.As for the argument – how best to put this – it’s not so much one. This whole co-evolution idea occurred to Pollan one day as he was gardening, and it never really leaves the realm of warm afternoon, busy hands, strange and intriguing thought. The whole thing comes out interesting, undeniably pretty, but ultimately nothing more than an intellectual exercise. An exercise I enjoyed, mind you, but I’m really not after musings over the Apollonian and Dionysian paradigms in my discussions of anything related to evolution: I’m after, you know, scientifically sound genotypic mechanisms. But like I said, I was perfectly happy to go along. I just fervently hope no one came away from this book believing this is what is meant by “theory of evolution.”Eclectic, engaging subject matter. A bit of pleasant but deeply fluffy intellectual masturbation tacked around the edges for an excuse. Wonderful writing. A good time, all around."

I loved the former, thought the latter was thin and a resaying of what he'd already said. This book was a beautiful book, though not the tome that O.D was, it's beautifully written. It also sets the stage nicely for O.D.Here, using apples (with their amazing capacity to evolve based on seeds that don't grow true to the parent), tuplips, cannabis and potatoes Pollan sets out plainly the case that Richard Attenborough made several years before: that both humans and the foods they eat co-evolve. In the final chapter, he begins to describe the connundrum of monoculture that he deals a death-blow to in O.D (in that anyone who reads it will understand for once and for all what a death-blow to humanity monoculture is).I loved this beautiful book."
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62390164-numidica,4,"Michael Pollan has convinced me to buy only organic potatoes from now on.The Botany of Desire is a book which presages two of Pollan’s later books, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, and How to Change Your Mind; the other two books were written later, and are better books, in my opinion. That said, there is much to learn in reading the Botany of Desire (BoD, hereinafter). Pollan, like me, is a gardener, so I have common beliefs on many issues touching land use and food; anyone who has gardened for a long time comes to understand soil and ecology, and Pollan clearly does. BoD is divided in four sections: Apples, Tulips, Marijuana, and Potatoes. The section on potatoes was clearly the basis for, or dry run for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, but Omnivore’s Dilemma is a better treatment of modern agriculture in general, as well as organic farming and its uses. I will say the recitation of pesticides and herbicides that get dumped on standard potato crops is scary; one farmer said that after application of one of the more potent pesticides, he does not go into the fields for five days for any reason, and he does not allow his employees to do so. Also, the use of GMO plants with built-in pesticides like bt (bacillus thuringiensis) engineered into their DNA is frightening, especially given the now widely known worldwide decline of insects. Pollan’s point, which is perhaps better made in Omnivore’s Dilemma, is that it doesn’t have to be this way; for a slightly higher price we could have organic produce, or at least we could have far less chemically treated produce. The other point Pollan makes, both with regard to potatoes and apples is that clones (which is what all the varieties of spuds and apples are) are more susceptible to insect pests and eventually lose vigor. Remember the term, “hybrid vigor”? Clones don’t have it, because, well, they’re clones, not hybrids.The section on marijuana is interesting, but Pollan covered the same ground much more comprehensively in How to Change Your Mind. The section on tulips mostly was uninteresting to me because it was more about the tulip “bubble” in Holland in the 1600’s than about gardening or plants, and I could have learned all I wanted to know about “tulipmania” in three or four paragraphs, versus the twenty or more pages spent on it. Also, I’ll admit that as a gardener I dislike tulips. One could create a plastic replica of a tulip that has as much interest to me; I don’t like formal gardens. There was some interesting stuff in this section about how plants have evolved to attract pollinators (bees, mostly).As for apples, that part was interesting, and I learned some things I did not know, though perhaps a bit more than I wanted to about Johnny Appleseed.So my recommendation is to read The Omnivore’s Dilemma to learn about food, and How to Change Your Mind to learn about psychoactive drugs; both are excellent books. If you read those two, you can decide for yourself whether you would like the added information available in BoD. As always, Pollan’s prose is engaging, and he clearly has studied in depth the subjects he is writing about, though sometimes he tells the reader a bit more than is absolutely necessary. Three and a half stars."

Pollan takes his readers on an odyssey through the natural histories of four plants that have been important to the course of human history, and relates them to a certain form of desire that he believes to be inherent in each and every person. He chronicles the potato (sustenance), the tulip (beauty), cannabis (pleasure), and the apple (sweetness). His prose is unrivaled, and he draws readers into his narrative with seamless ease."
26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Michael Pollan approaches the relationship between plants and humans through the aperture of the plant. The altered perspective displays the multiple props of genetic diversity — color, shape, size, fragrance, taste and robustness — offered to seduce the gardener's favors. Of course Pollan realizes that intent cannot be ascribed to the plant. These are merely the standard tools available to the plant for survival and procreation. ”Our desires are simply more grist for evolution's mill, no different from a change in the weather: a peril for some species, an opportunity for others.” (xxi) Nevertheless, this novel perspective shifts the focus away from a narrative of static human mastery to a dynamic Pollan calls the coevolutionary relationship.Pollan divides his exploration into four sections whose titles are consistent with his theme. The third section is titled “Desire: Intoxication/Plant: Marijuana.” Some readers might be tempted to skip ahead to this intriguing chapter. Don't! What looks at first glance like four separate essays are carefully structured stories of historical change reflecting abstract and ironic connections. The apple of chapter 1 is a plant of extreme biodiversity. The five seeds of a single fruit are a roll of the genetic dice. To bear fruit that resemble the parent apple, the tree must be grafted, a technique developed by the Chinese by the dawn of their dynastic history. This extreme biodiversity enabled the apple to adapt. The seeds John Chapman planted with both evangelical and entrepreneurial zeal sprouted all manner of fruit, most of it harvested for cider. Its familiarity was a welcome symbol of civilization. By contrast “Desire: Control/Plant: The Potato (chapter four) chronicles a recurring tragedy of monoculture. The tulip of chapter two and marijuana of chapter three, two unlikely fellow-travelers, have obverse stories that intersect in Holland. Pollan reminds the readers of changes now taken for granted. Gardens were not always landscaped for aesthetic appeal. Plants were prized for their utility. Not only did they provide food, but they were an important source for apothecary experiment. Sweetness was once a metaphor for rarity and perfection, as in the Shakespearean sense. This was before plentiful cheap sugar reduced the sensation to something commonplace and without nuance. (Talk to a Japanese person and she will aver that Japanese desserts have a “different” kind of sweetness if you doubt the flavor's true complexity). ”Like a shimmering equal sign, the word sweetness denoted a reality commensurate with human desire: it stood for fulfillment. Since then sweetness has lost much of its power and become slightly … well, saccarine.”  The Incas were model farmers. They combated mountainous terrain, variegated microclimates and plant infestation by planting multiple varieties of potato. Hence, the affliction that destroyed them was not a potato famine. Of course no account of the tulip would be complete without a review of tulipomania. Pollan travels the route of John Chapman through the then Northwest Territory and journeys to Idaho and Holland to interview modern day growers. He also inserts colorful and truly funny anecdotes from his own garden. His chapter on marijuana is a sobering reflection on the effects of a misguided public policy, and a fascinating look at ongoing research in neuroscience. Finally, his thoughts on genetic engineering are thought provoking. He presents the efforts of genetic engineers, commercial growers and small-scale organic farmers with depth and objectivity. Pollan's writing is transcendent. He is informative, poetic and philosophical. His phrasings are experiences to be savored over and over again. "

Aside from making me incredibly sad at not having a garden patch anymore in my home and having to contend with purchased pots and soil, this book was a delightful read. Michael Pollan takes a simple question - Have we domesticated plants or have plants domesticated us?- and to make a case for the latter, provides us with a heady mix of history,science,philosophy,botany,literature and what not, punctuating the text with juicy anecdotes, which I must say made for a truly spell-binding read.The bumblebee thinks that he is the subject in the garden and the bloom he's plundering for its drop of nectar is the object. But we know that this is just a failure of his imagination. The truth of the matter is that the flower has cleverly manipulated the bee into hauling its pollen from blossom to blossom.And so it is with us. There is no subject and no object. The grammar is all wrong. We plant and disperse the apple, thinking we act from our volition, yet from the apple's point of view, it has enticed us through its bribe of sweetness to further its propagation. It has played upon our desire. The same can be said of every other plant ""domesticated"" by humans.Of course, this idea is not Pollen's and it has been in existence for centuries right from the Vedic times, but the way he does the exposition through the 4 sections of this book- Apple, Tulip, Marijuana and Potato- is what is so good about this book.Failed miserably in trying to pick a clear favourite among the 4 sections. The Apple section dealt with the incredible life of Johnny Appleseed and the apple's journey from its original home in the wilderness of Kazakhstan- the way it was told was nothing short of an immigration drama, and apple-human games which have largely if not completely determined the Apple's biodiversity or the lack of it.The Tulip section focusses on why on earth humans have been so fascinated with flowers and even let their desire for flowers result in great economic collapses like the infamous Dutch Tulipomania. The section on Marijuana will definitely convince most people that US Government officials and politicians who brought about Cannabis illegalization not just in US but subsequently in countries like India where people have been using it for eons, were either nuts or downright maniacal. And the potato section was downright scary.One heck of a captivating read!"

Although I agree somewhat with his premise---that plants also influence human desires, not just vice versa---I never found that he fully developed a convincing proof of it. Rather, he just gently threads a tangential narrative about his subjects, as if he were having a conversation with you in his study while looking out the window at his garden. I did enjoy most of it, however, especially the Johnny Appleseed information, though at times I didn't find his narrative especially compelling.His sections on marijuana and the Monsanto NewLeaf potato reveal that he starts his narrative excursions from the standpoint of moderate conservatism, and he usually ends up slightly on the other side, though still keeping it centrist. I think he could definitely use a little more fire under his feet in setting out to write a book."

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
34,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."

Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "

38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
42,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about.

Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
49,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."

It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does."" (p. 215)""As much as I love the firm grasp and cerebral order of spring, there's a ripe, almost sensual pleasure in its August abandonment, too.""

This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
54,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."

The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."

When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"

Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "

To smell a raw potato is to stand on the very threshold of the domestic and the wild."" "
69,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: A Plant's-Eye View of the WorldMichael Pollan, now best known for his later book ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"", wrote this book (published in 2001) in four parts, corresponding to apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. His basic thesis is this: because we have made conscious (and subconscious) attempts to control their characteristics by means of breeding and selection, we have the idea that we have molded and controlled these plants, but we are at best only half-correct in that. Because of strong evolutionary pressures to best get us to do their bidding (plant their seeds, clear away competitors, bring fertilizer, etc.), these plants have in fact become expert at appealing to one or more of our desires. Essentially, because we have lived with these plants for so many generations, they are as adept at manipulating us as we are at manipulating them.The section on apples is dominated by the historical figure of John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed. More real estate speculator and purveyor of homebrewing raw materials, than the saccharine figure of later tales, Chapman was one of the men most responsible for adapting the apple tree varieties brought from Eurasia, to the very different climate(s) and soil(s) of North America. One thing I learned from this section was that the sweetening of apple varieties over the last two hundred years was even more extreme than I had known. Most of what Chapman planted were what Pollan says were called ""spitters"", apples good for making hard cider but not for eating. Pollan goes to a sort of Noah's Ark of apple varieties, where scores of now-rare varieties are still grown, and is amazed at the diversity. Over the last ten generations or so, we have pushed the apple relentlessly in the direction of sweetness, or (as Pollan would have it) the apple has moved that way to lure us into doing ever more work for it. One wonders, though, if this hasn't led to a certain sameness, like actresses on TV all looking too similar because they went to the same plastic surgeon. It is a theme that comes up in every section.The section on tulips is, of course, dominated by The Great Tulip Bubble, perhaps the strangest financial bubble in the history of finance. Whereas the apple appeals to our tastebuds, the tulip appeals to our eyes. Pollan tries to explain here how the tulip's beauty is Appolonian, as opposed to the Dionysian appeal of a rose, but I think he may have been pushing that point a bit beyond what it warranted. Nonetheless, the tale of how the brightly colored, and physically large, tulip appealed to our thirst for More!Color!Everywhere! is entertaining. I wonder why The Great Tulip Bubble is not a commonly told tale in children's books; it might teach lessons as useful as the Boy Who Cried Wolf or Little Red Riding Hood.The section on marijuana includes an entertaingly incompetent tale of Pollan growing a little bit himself, as well as the sage advice that reading Richard Dawkins ""The Selfish Gene"" stoned isn't necessarily wise. He surveys the broad history of humans using plant-derived substances to alter our consciousness, and gives a more in-depth view of what the last couple decades of the 20th century did to accelerate its march towards higher and higher potency. He visits a grower in the vicinity of Amsterdam, to see just how far from their weedy origins some growers have taken them. It is a foreshadowing of the final section, where we take on the uncomfortable issue of GMO's.The last section, on potatoes, has a bit of history, including of course the Irish famine of the mid-19th century. Pollan gets some samples of GMO-optimized potatoes from Monsanto, and plants them in his own garden. He does a credible job of attempting to be even-handed in his treatment of the issue of GMO's, despite his evident instinctive aversion to the idea. In the end, they grow well, and he is unable to bring himself to either eat them or serve them to others. Also, in this section, Pollan shows a bit of foresight that he has not crowed about since then as much as he could have. He mentions, years before it happened, that the development of strains of plant that are immune to Roundup (a herbicide also sold by Monsanto), could result in wild plants being pushed into developing more resistance to that very herbicide. The book was published in 2001, and it wasn't until 2011 that I first read of the problem. If it has soured Monsanto on the idea of GMO's, I have not heard of it, but the fact that Pollan (who is not a scientist) was able to see the risk when Monsanto was sure it wouldn't happen, suggests both that Pollan understands well the basic principles of natural and artificial selection, and also that Monsanto got this one wrong not because it was too hard to see, but because they didn't want to believe it.All in all, Pollan's book was equal parts fun and thought-provoking."

Did he use ridiculously florid language as a big pun?So a similar structure to The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, four sections, each based on a specific plant. In this case: the apple, the tulip, marijuana and the potato (primarily of the genetically modified variety). The idea is that these four plants have taken the four key strategies to manipulating their environment (primarily, us): sweetness (literal and figurative, ugh), beauty, intoxication, control.This could be interesting, and I actually did find the apple and potato sections somewhat so, and I may have learned a thing or two about the history of the tulip. But overall, his style--I thought particularly so in the tulip section--was just heavy with unnecessary linguistic diversion bordering on the baroque (yeah, kind of like that). I wonder if he suddenly felt free of the constraints of pithy newspaper journalism and just went crazy. Or maybe he talks that way (not when I've heard him speak, and I've actually enjoyed it when I have). I have some recollection of an overabundance of tropes, tropisms, and chthonics (an elaborate exploration of the Apollonian vs the Dionysian, based largely on two works of Nietzsche it appears comes FREE with your purchase of Botany of Desire) appearing throughout. So this was too much to bear, pretty much no matter what he said. Then there was the Dionysus/Apollo thing, which was somewhat bearable in the apple section, in which Pollan uses Nietzsche to argue that Johnny Appleseed was Dionysus incarnate. I mean really. But then the Greek deities start appearing in every other paragraph and I had trouble focusing.The marijuana chapter I found pointless. He goes into a long argument that cannabinoids tend to help us forget, which is critical to survival; thus cannabis thrived because it helped our ancestors cope with a harsh life and helped us forget. He also goes into how it removes the filters of perception (wonder if he's tried LSD?), blah blah. Really gained nothing from reading this.And a minor criticism--it's far, far worse in Omnivore--is that he injects himself way more than necessary. We have to hear about his wild apple seed he planted (ask him about it next time you hear him speak: how'd it taste?, his black tulips, the near run-in with the local sheriff while he grew pot behind the barn, and the GMO potato from Monsanto that threatens to bring about insects resistant to one of organic farmers' favorite pest-preventers that comes from a bacterium that lives in soil.That felt good to get off my chest. Now, the redeeming parts. I enjoyed the history of the apple and the potato, some of the rehashing of the history of the tulip. I did learn that the apple originally comes from Kazakhstan, that the 'breaking' in tulips that helped stir the financial mania was due to a virus, that a great way to prevent fish from sticking to your grill is to slice a raw potato lengthwise and rub it over the grill before the fish (wasn't clear if the grill was to be hot or not). I also appreciated his pointing out that the great service that Johnny Appleseed did for us was spread the wild seed of the apple tree far and wide, conducting a grand genetic screening experiment whereby we found many of the one-in-a-thousand varieties of apple that we know the fruit as today. If we had jumped sooner into monoculture of the apple, many varieties would not be around today.Interestingly, the last section on the potato was largely about pesticides and genetically modified crops, kinda foreshadowing Omnivore. You can sort of feel him gearing up in style and structure. Fortunately, he swaps arrogance in for his florid writing style, which makes Omnivore a little more palatable. Both suffer from being way, WAY too long for what he has to say. He's really stretching it to reach book length. Indeed, in my paperback edition, he gives us 1.5 spacing (what, so we can take notes between lines), and still only manages 250 pages including intro and epilogue. This is worth a dozen pages at most. Why do I keep falling into the journalist trap of converting a well-written article into so much fluff?"

Though this section did provide me with the most unknown information and curious history. That a single man could have predicted where the next wave of settlers was going to show up and create a very profitable business out of the American pioneers insatiable appetite for apple cider, and that this should turn out to create a massive variety of different types of one fruit is nothing short of amazing. That the story should have been so Americancentric when the history of apples is obviously much wider was disappointing. Moving on to tulips provided me with very little new knowledge other than that the beautiful aberrations in tulips are caused by a virus. The long and detailed talk about marijuana was perhaps not interesting for me based on where I live, who my friends are and how familiar I am with the industry, both in its legal and illegal facets. Living where I do has given me ample opportunity to know about the subject and to not really associate the drug with as much stigma as living in other areas might have done. Discussing cultivars and changes in the plant are old news, talking about hydroponics, smells and indoor cultivation is stuff I know and in much more detail than talked about here. When it's a big political topic about whether to legalize or not, almost everything gets discussed in the press, when it's so accepted in a social sense and your friends, neighbours and co-workers smoke it with impunity, it's hard to get excited. Are mind altering drugs good for us or not? I've heard his theories and many opposing ones, there was nothing new here. And then for the lowly potato, my big issue here was not enough information, how do you judge with so little data? How do you know if it is good or bad? A few anecdotes and a couple conversations are pretty measly information to go on as far as I'm concerned. If you're worried about genetic changes in potatoes, there is a whole lot of other food you should be concerned about, possibly all of it. Maybe part of the discussion should be about the good in this as well as the bad. And isn't there other corporations that should be brought to the table here, not just Monsanto? Over all I found the book slap dash and uninformative. Some of this could be that in the intervening years since it was first published, much of this information is common knowledge. Some of it could be my taste in a more factual, historic and scientific nonfiction rather than social commentary or personal opinion pieces. Whatever the reason, I don't think it was a very good book. "

76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7016416-ma-arms,2,"While interesting, Pollan's idea - that we should look at plants as being symbiotic with humans rather than simply the subject of human action - is not nearly as radical as he claims it to be, and the notion has been present in the study of the origins of agriculture for several decades. What is troubling, however, is Pollan's tendency, both in this book and in other books, articles, and interviews, to subtly push a particular agenda with little regard for evidence. In this book it is manifest in the section on potatoes. He asks a number of very valid questions about the genetically modified potatoes that he has planted, and is justifiably critical of the answers that he receives from Monsanto. However, when he visits an organic potato farm, he lets equally dubious answers about the organic potatoes go unchallenged, and he concludes, based on a lack of any real information about the organic potatoes (other than that they are claimed to be better, though no actual evidence is provided) that the genetically modified ones are not to be trusted, and he makes a point of stating that he threw his out without further consideration. This is a common tendency of Pollan's - while he offers good questions and criticisms about modern farming technologies, he seems to intentionally leave out the very real problems with organic farming techniques (even failing to grasp, as far as I can tell, that the term ""organic"" is itself more of a marketing term than a meaningful distinction). Were he to make his position clear, then one could fairly evaluate his position, but he hides it and, therefore, produces a rather dishonest advocacy for a method that he favors, though he never actually gives a good reason why."

78,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10903318-mitch-rogers,3,"Pollan is working very hard to be a scientific Annie Dillard. Sometimes he pulls it off, but sometimes he muddles his science and sterilizes his poetry. For example, he spent a significant amount of time in the intro reminding us that evolution is a blind, non-teleologically driven process, but then through the book personifies plants enough to blur that definition. "
79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3883978-amit-kurien,5,"If the science books I have read reveal science writers, then Pollan is among the top three! Here is Pollan cleverly asking the reader to think of plants not as any vegetative material that we gulp down, kick off the ground, and cut down daily, but as species - just like us. The question he asks is this - if a human and a plant were JUST two species in the Darwinian world of struggle for survival, then didn't the Potato do a better job at being fruitful and multiply, or perhaps outright world dominion? Or the apple or cannabis or the tulip? Didn't these plants learn from us (in a certain metaphorical way), to modify itself to suit our ""weaknesses"" more than we ever managed to modify (or commodify) or use them? Pollan explores how the plants hitchhiked, multiplied and prevailed taking advantage of four of our most fallible senses - sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control. Pollan's erudition comes across not through facts or figures (or his wonderful sense of metaphors and history), but by letting the big grand idea of a different way of thinking seep in to the reader in the attempt to understand his subject-in my opinion, the mark of a true scientific communicator. Pollan's 'Omnivore's Dilemma' is also a good read."

I was somewhat familiar with the history of the potato and the tulip--less so regarding apples and pot. You get a fair amount of historical information. It's often organized rather idiosyncratically, with quite a lot of musings on the Apollonian versus the Dionysian approaches to life and beauty.There's a strong liberal slant on most of this, especially regarding the background information on the drug war and genetically modified foods. This isn't a weakness--just something to be aware of. He makes some very good, well supported points. Particularly poignant was the farmer who keeps a small patch of his potatoes unfertilized/bug-dusted/so on, because while he believes the poisons are flushed through and broken down by the time the potatoes are dug up for the consumer, he's afraid of poisoning his family with fresh-dug potatoes that have had so many chemicals dumped on them.I can see why Pollan is such a darling--he's incredibly readable, bringing dusty historical figures to life and simplifying complex issues to something that can be grappled with. But do expect the road to wander a bit on its way to its destination. "
81,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,1,"Until now, Pollan has been a favorite author. This book started out great, so great that it could have ended up being a favorite. It reminded me of  John Grey's Straw Dogs or Peter Wohlleben's Secret Life of Trees because it was told from the perspective of the plants and challenged the story that humans are special. Pollan's beautiful writing masterfully brought the plants to life and allowed the reader to think in a less usual, and certainly more enjoyable way, but then it all came crashing down in the last chapter. What the hell was that??? He cherry picked a few possibly scary stories about GMOs, glossed over all the good they do, equated GMOs with concerns about pesticides (wage war on the *pesticide* and then you won't have to worry about it being part of your GMAO), and ignited false and uneducated concerns for the general public about GMOs. At this point, I am about to put Pollan into the same category as the anti vaxxers. I have loved just about every Pollan book I have read up to now. I feel as if I lost a friend. I definitely can't read any books by someone who purports to be a science writer but willfully leaves out incredibly important science and engages in fear mongering when discussing things like GMOs. "
82,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/135817-sharon,4,"Really interesting (if at times stretched to fit) hypothesis that plants have exerted their own influence on humans to propagate the species. The book was uneven at times, and the best chapters in my mind were the apple (sweetness) and the potato (control). Who knew that all modern apple trees are descendants of a single tree of their type, grafted an infinite number of times – that if planted from seed each apple tree would produce its own distinct variety? The chapter on the potato was terrifying, and it was particularly here that I appreciated Pollan’s interwoven tales of his own small potato patch and the huge, chemical wastelands of the modern Idaho potato farmer. All the chapters caution about the unforeseeable consequences of too much control over the environment – that a certain degree of “wildness” is not only more interesting, but a biological requirement. This book was a good blend of science, history and philosophy, written in an easy, conversational tone, and I look forward to reading more of his works. "
83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436799-dinah,5,"Caveats first: Michael Pollan is less than diligent about naming his sources and weeding out the dubious ones. He does much better wading through facts to find meaning than riding out to sea on long philosophical tangents divorced from context. He tends to repeat himself.All that being said, Botany of Desire was a great read. The historical legwork that went into pulling this book together is impressive, and Pollan has a way of juxtaposing anecdotes and statistics that completely turns a lay understanding of agriculture on its head. In its best sections this book is like my favorite kind of poetry -- trivia heavy and dripping with newly exposed truth about the human condition, culled directly from the facts on the ground. When it's tedious, it's tedious, but who's to blame a guy for losing the thread fifty pages into a section on tulips or potatoes. Great as a thought exercise, ok as a loose history book, big old failure as a reference for drug law and copyright information. I'll take it anyway."
84,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649064-matthew,5,"Delightful in almost every way. First of all, beautifully and skillfully written, so this exploration of science and agriculture is eminently readable. But also virtuosic in unexpected ways. Each chapter explores the way that humans domesticate nature in order to conform to our desires, but also the ways that nature exploits human desire for its own gain. This construction challenges our normal distinctions between nature and culture, savagery and civilization, wilderness and domestic gardens, Apollonian notions of order and Dionysian desires for abandon and dissolution. In Pollan's deft hands, these discursive explorations are often profound and fascinating. Personally, I found the chapter on Cannabis--which Pollan uses as the gateway to the desire for transcendence--to be a particularly insightful exploration of consciousness, and the unstable boundaries between matter and spirit in humanity's perennial search for the eternal.

I'm fond of plants and of gardens, though I don't know as much as I'd like to about either, and Pollan is a reliably excellent writer who took me into some unexpectedly interesting places in this one. Though we like to think we've controlled plants with all our agriculture and cross-breeding--and we have, of course, to a large degree--you can also look at it from another angle and see that these plants (be they apples, tulips, marijuana, potatoes, or other human favorites) have controlled us just as equally. And by the way, after that final chapter about Monsanto's new editions of the potato and other crops, in tandem with the number and intensity of chemicals sprayed on typical varieties (non-Monsanto but also non-organic), I am VERY glad we subscribe to a service that brings us a box of organic produce weekly. Off to eat some organic potato soup for lunch now!"

Unfortunately, it felt a bit dated as he delved into genetic engineering and issues with marijuana legality, which have changed so much in the past 15 years that I found myself wondering what he would have written today instead of in 2001.Also, the information itself was different from what I was expecting, given the subtitle: A Plant's-Eye View of the World. The stories were very anthropocentric and it seemed that the human interaction with the plants was not necessarily for the plants' benefit, as he argues on a few occasions. In almost all cases, humans have focused on creating monocultures, which make plants more susceptible to disease and in some cases were bred to encourage virus (Semper Agustus tulips). The story was enjoyable, with interesting historical insights and anecdotes, but I feel like I learned more about Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, the Dutch, and Monsanto than I did about apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes as I was anticipating."

I never felt like I was being talked down to (my complaint for other popular science/nonfiction books); instead, it was as though author  Michael Pollan had sat down to talk with me and had really cool things to say. The book associates four plants with their abilities to satisfy human desires and impulses -- the apple with sweetness, the tulip with beauty, marijuana with intoxication, and the potato with control. The Botany of Desire is well worth the time to read and particularly good for summer reading, because each chapter stands alone, making it easy to put it down and then pick it back up again."

The plants/desire combinations, if I remember them correctly, included: beauty/tulip, sweetness/apple, intoxication/marijuana, and control/potato. While some of Mr. Pollan's arguments occasionally require a bit of a leap or maybe a little faith, his ideas are always thought provoking and worthy of some reflection. If you are going to read his works, this is pretty good. However, if you are only going to read one, I would recommend Second Nature first. "

Up until the last chapter (on potatoes), I was going to rate this at only 3 stars, or “ok”. The potato chapter really bumped up the rating for me, as Pollan was comparing a new Monsanto genetically-engineered potato with the usual potatoes he grows in his farm. By far, I thought this was the most interesting chapter. I did also enjoy the chapter on apples and the tidbits I learned about John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed).

I enjoyed it when he told his little stories and anecdotes, but when he went on (and on and on and on and... you get the idea) about ""what is consciousness"" or ""what is desire"" he totally lost me.

Overall, I disagree with his view on some things, and I think after reading ""In Defense of Food"", which Pollan wrote after this book, and seeing a somewhat more firm stance against Monsanto in that book (of which I more agree), it is also interesting to see how his writing developed/changed (like we all do). I think the Johnny Appleseed facts were really interesting, and I laughed out loud at many of the anecdotes in that section. The tulip chapter made me notice/care about tulips in a way that I definitely haven't before, and I looked up facts about Sultan/Tulip Era because of it! The chapter about marijuana disappointed me, but I also just finished Pollan's new book on psychedelics, which has way more information in it, although his one anecdote really is funny in that chapter as well. The tomato chapter I have many issues with, again with Monsanto, and the ending feels a little sponsor-ship like, but interesting to read. Pollan approaches things from a safe distance, and I can respect that he at least writes about it and makes others think of it too. Quotes I like: ""As for the fierce part of the Dionysian drama, this Johnny Appleseed did not play. He was a far more gentle, less sexual being than Dionysus, thought his gender does sometimes seem equally amorphous. (Come to think of it, Chapman did sponsor sex orgies -- but only among apple trees.)""The whole concept of memes - and how strongly that applies to today with our ""memes"". :: ""Memes are a culture's building blocks, passed down from brain to brain in a Darwinian process that leads, by trial and error, to cultural innovation and progress. The memes that prove themselves best adapted to their ""environment' -- that is, that ones that are most helpful for people to keep in their brains -- are the ones most likely to survive and replicate and become widely regarded as good, true, or beautiful.""""Christianity and capitalism are both probably right to detest a plant like cannabis. ... More even than most plant drugs, cannabis, by immersing us in the present and offering something like fulfillment here and now, short-circuits the metaphysics of desire on which Christianity and capitalism (and so much else in our civilization) depend.""Quotes I have issue with:Pollan's view on evolution, and how plants are domesticating us. ::""For a flower the path to world domination passes through humanity's ever-shifting ideals of beauty."" -- Nah, I think flowers/tulips would be fine without us honestly. Especially with us spreading their most diseased bulbs for our enjoyment. ""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is as the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests""--I just really think they could have managed without us. Even without the Tulip Era and us planting them everywhere. This seems really...[paranoid] to me. ""Witches and sorcerers cultivated plants with the power to ""cast spells""--in our vocab, ""psychoactive plants. Their potion recipes called for such things as datura, opium poppies, bella-donna, hashish, fly-agaric mushrooms, and the skins of toads (which contain DMT). These ingredients would be combined in a hempseed-oil-based ""flying ointment"" that the witches would then administer vaginally using a special dildo. This was the ""broomstick"" by which these women were said to travel.""--Literally what the fuck. Where did you get this info from, Pollan? *Read/Discussed with friends "
112,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18373769-charlotte,5,"After reading Cooked, I kept looking for the magic (Food! Mythology! Recipes!(?) Gardening! History! Interesting humans!) that I found in that book in his other food books but found the others not as compelling. It was definitely worth the long waitlist to get to this book. I was a little nervous about how I might enjoy it after listening to the introduction. I am already fully on the train of how we have evolved to accommodate other species (likely because this book was written awhile ago and that idea is no longer fresh). I guess I will day that after reading the book, I also have this sense that everything is just Random, and while we can think of plants evolving so we can propagate their DNA across the land...it’s just a function of how life is. But, of course, it’s fun to think of plants with volition and desire. I very much enjoyed the chapter on apples and Johnny Appleseed (who is so iconic that he deserves an autocorrect capitalization, apparently—great job apple marketers) and his ...seedy past. :) Thinking about the metaphysical heft of the word “sweetness” in an age where it was far more rare was also really fun to think about (and will color my thoughts of the implications of the author in texts written before a certain time). I also had no idea about how modern apples are ...propagated? (Or how grafting worked!) Definitely want to visit that orchard of Free Apples if I ever have a chance. For whatever reason the tulip chapter was interesting to me but not as revolutionary as the apple chapter. I may just love food stories, and feel more detachment re: flowers and beauty. That’s not saying that I’m not going to look at tulips a little differently in the future or consider planting them in our garden...Same with the cannabis chapter. Cool, educational, interesting, but not AS mind blowing. Possibly because I also read How to Change Your Mind beforehand and had a taste. Also because I have lived my life and not ever had a strong desire to ever get high (fear? Because people sometimes already think I am? Because I sometimes, (perhaps in arrogance), already feel like I’ve connected with the universe in that transcendent way, through art, looking into someone’s eyes, or friggin trash on the sidewalk?) (I will likely try someday, but won’t be aggressively pursuing it). The potato chapter felt short to me (and slightly redundant considering the McDonald’s bits he later wrote about that I’ve read), but it was still interesting to understand why the potato famine happened, and also the developments in genetically modified self-pesticide producing potatoes, and it’s horrifying possible future implications. Another theme that I didn’t expect to enjoy as much was Pollan’s windows into gardening culture. My partner and I just started at our community garden, so I felt like I was an initiate of his club? Well, “THE Club,” I guess. I had fun measuring whether his gardening personality stereotypes fit us or not, and after seeing that many did, realizing that I’m now a part of a group I hadn’t considered myself a part of. So am I saying that I’m giving this book 5 stars almost entirely on the basis of apples, gardening, and GMO fries? Yeah. Really, I’d just do it for them apples."

The author has chosen from four classes of domesticated plants: the apple (fruit), the tulip (flower), cannabis (drug plant), and the potato (staple food). The book is titled as such because human desires (sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control) derived from the aforementioned classes of plants for a part of natural history.

This enlightening 304-page book includes the following four chapters/stories: 1. Desire: Sweetness / Plant: The Apple, 2. Desire: Beauty / Plant: The Tulip, 3. Desire: Intoxication / Plant: Marijuana and 4. Desire: Control / Plant: The Potato.Positives:1. Engaging, conversational tone with a sense of humor to boot.2. I underestimated how interesting a book on domesticated plants could be a testament of Pollan's ability as a writer. He relates stories from the chosen domesticated plant (apple, tulip, cannabis, and potato) point of view.3. A balanced and good mix of biology and history. Pollan skillfully immerses scientific tidbits with historical anecdotes and ends up with an interesting narrative.4. A fun book to read and short of being arrogant here, you will learn some interesting facts about history and to a lesser degree science.5. The story of how pioneers help domesticate the frontier by seeding it with Old World plants. The story of John Chapman better known as Johnny Appleseed plays a prominent role in the story of the apple. Pollan does a good job of debunking myths and putting history in perspective.6. Pollan shares many interesting facts throughout the book. ""The fact, simply, is this: apples don't ""come true"" from seeds--that is, an apple tree grown from a seed will be a wildling bearing little resemblance to its parent.""7. The role of the apple in early American history. ""It wasn't until late in the nineteenth century that sugar became plentiful and cheap enough to enter the lives of very many Americans (and most of them lived on the eastern seaboard); before then the sensation of sweetness in the lives of most people came chiefly from the flesh of fruit. And in America that usually meant the apple.""8. Understanding what's behind the quest for sweetness. ""Anthropologists have found that cultures vary enormously in their liking for bitter, sour, and salty flavors, but a taste for sweetness appears to be universal.""9. I really enjoyed the religious historical references. ""In fact, the Bible never names ""the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,"" and that part of the world is generally too hot for apples, but at least since the Middle Ages northern Europeans have assumed that the forbidden fruit was an apple. (Some scholars think it was a pomegranate.)""10. Apple and its relation to the alcoholic beverage. ""Corn liquor, or ""white lightning,"" preceded cider on the frontier by a few years, but after the apple trees began to bear fruit, cider--being safer, tastier, and much easier to make--became the alcoholic drink of choice.""11. The story of the tulip and how it impacted one nation's economy. ""Never before or since has a flower--a flower!--taken a star turn on history's main stage as it did in Holland between 1634 and 1637. All that remains of this episode, a speculative frenzy that sucked people at every level of society into its whorl.""12. Fascinating facts on flowers, ""devotion to flowers posed a challenge to monotheism, was a bright ember of pagan nature worship that needed to be smothered. Incredibly, there were no flowers in Eden--or, more likely, the flowers were weeded out of Eden when Genesis was written down.""13. So what conceivable benefit is there for a predilection for flowers? Find out.14. Where would we be without the explanatory power of the grand theory of evolution? ""Sexual selection""--that is, evolution's favoring of features that increase a plant's or animal's attractiveness and therefore its reproductive success--is the best explanation we have for the otherwise senseless extravagance of feathers and flowers, maybe also sports cars and bikinis.""15. The fascination with toxins. ""According to Ronald K. Siegel, a pharmacologist who has studied intoxication in animals, it is common for animals deliberately to experiment with plant toxins; when an intoxicant is found, the animal will return to the source repeatedly, sometimes with disastrous consequences.""16. American society's impact on cannabis. ""For the modern prohibition against marijuana led directly to a revolution in both the genetics and the culture of the plant. It stands as one of the richer ironies of the drug war that the creation of a powerful new taboo against marijuana led directly to the creation of a powerful new plant."" Bonus quote, ""(Before the crackdown on marijuana growers, THC levels in ordinary marijuana ranged from 2 to 3 percent, according to the DEA; for sinsemilla, 5 to 8 percent.) Nowadays THC levels upward of 20 percent are not unheard of."" Amazing.17. Our desire for control manifested in the potato. ""I planted a potato called `NewLeaf' that has been genetically engineered (by the Monsanto corporation) to produce its own insecticide. This it does in every cell of every leaf, stem, flower, root, and--this is the unsettling part--every spud.""18. The history of the potato. ""The Andes, 1532. The patented potatoes I was planting are descended from wild ancestors growing on the Andean altiplano, the potato's ""center of diversity."" It was here that Solanum tuberosum was first domesticated more than seven thousand years ago by ancestors of the Incas.""19. The fascinating history of the Irish potato famine. ""This they would abruptly discover late in the summer of 1845, when Phytophthora infestans arrived in Europe, probably on a ship from America. Within weeks the spores of this savage fungus, borne on the wind, overspread the continent, dooming potatoes and potato eaters alike.""20. Excellent notes.Negatives:1. Pollan's storytelling ability surpasses his grasp of science.2. The chapter I was most looking forward to reading, ""Desire: Intoxication / Plant: Marijuana"", turned out to be the weakest.3. After much thought and deliberation, the author's main thesis doesn't really hold up to scrutiny. The domesticated plants of this book resulted from humankind's control and influence not so much the other way around. Interesting and great storytelling but the thesis doesn't hold water.4. Book could have been at least 50 pages shorter without losing its essence.5. Some of the science is speculative and lacks beef.In summary, never underestimate the ability of an author to turn what I thought was going to be a bland appetizer into a delicious entrée. Pollan does a wonderful job of storytelling and the result is a content reader with some newfound knowledge and wisdom. That being said, the main thesis doesn't hold water and the chapter on marijuana was, dare I say, lacked stimulation. Some of the science is speculative (some due to the infancy of the science in certain areas). Overall, this book was a treat to read and worth reading. I recommend it! BTW watch the excellent documentary based off this book and make good use of your Amazon Prime subscription.Further recommendations: ""Second Nature: A Gardener's Education"" and ""Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation"" from the same author, ""Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana - Medical, Recreational and Scientific"" by Martin A.

114,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10268735-christian,5,"Instant favorite.I didn't expect much more than the familiar conspiracy theory about how plants could be seen as controlling us. Rather, what Michael Pollan talks about is our fundamental relationship with nature. He does this using four representative crops: apples, flowers, cannabis and potatoes. They all represent things we desire from nature: sweetness, beauty, intoxication, control. Apples crossbreed easily. We used that to create sweeter fruits and to propagate the trees in new environments. They were once a symbol of civilization in the early US and we get to understand why following the steps of Johnny Appleseed.Flowers are one of the rare things that are universally understood as beautiful: their role is literally to attract, and they often do using many senses (their shape, color, fragrance, softness, sweet nectar...) Their beauty is even amplified by their fleeting nature.Cannabis is one the many ways to alter our state of consciousness. Our modern lives are far removed from our primitive biology. It's sometimes good to rediscover how amazing music is, how tasty food is, how precious friends are and how valuable a single moment is. It's illegality in most places seems to come from our religious history: fighting paganism meant stopping people from believing spirituality could be found in nature.Potatoes: to boil, to roast, to fry... We shaped it, we adopted it, we once relied too much on it in Ireland. GMOs might be safe for now, but it cuts our relationship with nature: it's not a two-way relationship anymore. We dictate what we want and make plants infertile (i.e. we mute them) I would say the only downside for me was the last focus on GMOs, which retrospectively felt like the point of the book. Maybe it is? It's probably an interesting thought process for anyone wanting to argue on that controversial subject... I mean, the book is super interesting, but I don't want to discuss science (and I wouldn't read this as a reliable source of scientific information). Anyway, there's so much to be learned from the first three chapters though. I'm not usually a fan of history, but Pollan actually makes it interesting (and insightful). I definitely learned many new things, like the origin of the association between brooms and witches (NSFW, google it) and why it was once normal to feed children with hard cider. The chapter on cannabis made me realize something completely unexpected. It's not like I didn't know at some level, but religion's most basic claim is that spirituality comes from above. I've always thought of this ""spirituality comes from above"" as something in opposition to ""nothing comes from above"", but Christianism started with a fight against paganism, which is almost synonymous with nature worship (spirituality comes from around). In fact religion vs. paganism sounds like a culture vs. nature fight. Just like drugs are generally anti-cultural in a sense, since it causes people to step out of 'normal'/learned behavior. All this conceptualization of nature definitely threw fuel on my FIRE dream of living in the countryside with a big garden :)"

It was your love of that work that decided me, and now I blame you for my Pollan obsession.  The Botany of Desire was a great first choice as an introduction to Michael Pollan's work. It's a neatly organized book that covers four plants -- the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato -- which have changed and been changed by people. And the history of each is fascinating. Pollan's scholarship is deep and often quirky, and always includes his personal experience of growing each of these plants in his garden.I could cite wonderful stories from this book all day, about how John ""Johnny Appleseed"" Chapman changed the apple into an iconic American fruit by planting seeds, not grafted plants. About how the very thing that provoked tulip mania in 17th century Amsterdam was a virus that would kill the bulbs eventually.  About how American weed went from being the cheap, much maligned choice for stoners to being the most expensive weed on the planet. And about how Monsanto and McDonalds are changing the market for potatoes and making monoculture the norm.  I could, but I'm not going to because I want you to read this book and think about the plants that surround us, and what they mean, how we relate to them, and how they change to suit our needs which ensures their survival.  Because for plants, it's all about survival strategies.  Pollan writes with intelligence and humor, and a goodly dose of honesty. He pulls his readers into his subjects, and simply doesn't let go until he's told us everything we need to know about them. On the strength of this book alone, I can say that I would read anything he's written, and in fact that's what I'm trying to do.  I really can't recommend his work highly enough.So there, Offerman.  I hope you're proud of yourself."
116,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42452839-carolyn-quijano,4,"Michael Pollan is a great author. His books always follow a logical progression towards his overall message. He is able to write about scientific topics with an air of romanticism. He is obviously passionate about the research he does and presents it coherently and rationally. The four sections of the book discuss apples, tulips, cannabis, and the potato. He expresses his intimacy with each of these plants as he has either tried growing or is growing each of these.Somehow, Pollan is able to make the story of the apple interesting. He begins with the story of the apple and its' biodiversification (starting the the story of Johnny Appleseed).His portion on weed was great, and this is great timing to read this book as his new book on psychedelics will be released this month. He discusses the use of drugs and early religions and slyly throws in how the tree of knowledge could have been a mind-altering plant.His section on the potato was probably the most interesting to me. I haven't done a lot of my own research on GMOs, but have never felt great about them. He gives a really good depiction of GMOs and how much we really don't know about them. He doesn't say GMOs are bad. He doesn't say they're good either. However, after reading this book, I'm never buying a non-organic potato again. Basically GMO potatoes are considered pesticides and and non-GMO potatoes are riddled with pesticides. Michael Pollan discusses the McDonald's French fry and how we view it as being the ideal French fry. This sprung up my own thoughts on food and beauty. How have we been trained to identify what kinds or foods look appealing?I'd rate this book a 4.5. It's worth reading."
117,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8273355-dru,5,"A great read (and make even better that Scott Brick narrated the audiobook). The premise drew me in: That co-evolution between plants and animals *includes* humans. That we are doing the ""plant's bidding"" by choosing which apples or tulips get perpetuated and which ones get put on the ""weed pile"". Told from the standpoint of apples, tulips, cannabis and potatoes, this book is a fast-paced and easy read, full of facts and thinking points. It delves into the importance of biodiversity (for resistance to pests and disease) yet talks about the human-driven problem of wanting ""perfect french fries"", which leads to monoculture (the planting of one and only one type of potato with identical cloned genes, in millions of acres around the world, to appease the fast food chains). It goes into gardening, in depth, and makes you really *think* about plants as a food source. If you weren't eating ""organic"" before, you might just consider it after this book. Then again, you might also find yourself wanting to try the latest versions of pot that've been bred over the last 30 years too!Highly recommended!"
118,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39562333-spectre,2,"Reading groups can benefit from selecting this book because it touches so many controversial subjects from Greek & Roman mythology to evolution to genetic engineering of crops. That is also the trouble with this book as the author takes four ""crops"" and tries to link a mythological connection between man, civilization, and food: ""More even than plant drugs, cannabis, by immersing us in the present and offering something like fulfillment here and now, short circuits the metaphysics of desire on which Christianity and capitalism (and so much else in our civilization) depend."" (p.175) WHAT? Our reading group recently discussed C.S. Lewis's concept of ""sublime"", a term author Michael Pollan used extensively in the book and my understanding of the concept was difficult then and was no clearer now. It is wonderful that we have reached a level of food production in this country (thank you farmers) that we are able to debate whether man controls food or vice versa compared to many societies (past and present) who must plant and grow crops in order to survive regardless of metaphysics."
119,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67064461-cj,2,"The book has a fascinating premise. Loved the introduction. An article length piece (https://michaelpollan.com/interviews/...) raises intriguing questions like the relationship between plants/food and humans over time, illusions of control, interdependence, symbolism.But I was disappointed in the book’s delivery. While claiming to give “a plant’s eye view,” starting with the chapter on the apple, the focus and arc was entirely on John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and the contrast between his historical eccentricity and the fabled saint he became. I know my hurriedness made me extra grouchy. I wasn’t giving time to explore new paradigms for humanity and nature as in the premise. The structure of just 4 chapters, 60 pages each also didn’t help. I was likely expecting either ethnographic hypotheses like Jared Diamond’s or a type of poetry (in the way Jorge Borges viewed Martin Buber’s philosophical texts about being human). This text was unfortunately easy to skim through. "

I tried to trudge through the ebook for a couple weeks but it reads like a bad English composition, which is a shame because there are a few interesting points. It feels mostly opinion, not a lot of fact, minimal referencing of sources, a lot of repetition - all points which reinforce it being a good listen (I was able to finish 70% of the book over the course of 24 hours at 1.75x while doing other tasks, as opposed to the weeks previously mentioned - thank god for the library) as opposed to it being a good single focus read, which I would never have been able to get through. Some of the topics were interesting, but I learned more facts in a shorter amount of time by reading one page on the Amsterdam Tulip Museum website than in the entire tulip chapter. I just don’t care to read about how someone describes a plant. Overall, something to have on in the background, but if you have other things on your reading list pick those."
121,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7761064-sue-burke,4,"Journalist Michael Pollan brings a gardener’s eye to four plants to reveal our human relationship to the vegetable kingdom, and how these plants fulfill our desires – or not.These days the apple appeals to our sweet tooth, but Johnny Appleseed spread orchards for cider, specifically hard cider. The tulip shows how foolish we are with money, and how plants might fail to cooperate with our greed. Marijuana, on the other hand, seems quite willing to help us get high. Finally, the potato shows how far we’re willing to go to try to control farming, and this is the most disturbing chapter. Our efforts at control are bound to fail, perhaps catastrophically, as they have in the past.Pollan takes a very personal look at these plants, tracing the route of Johnny Appleseed with an evangelistic guide. He muses on the tulips growing in his own garden and on his personal encounters with marijuana. As an experiment, he grows genetically engineered potatoes in his back yard.His fondness for plants shines through his words, even as he sometimes meanders around the subject.

Domestication is about a whole lot more than fat tubers and docile sheep; the offspring of the ancient marriage of plants and people are far stranger and more marvelous than we realize. There is a natural history of the human imagination, of beauty, religion, and possibly philosophy too.
Is this a story of four plants (apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes) and their relationships with the humans who domesticated them, or perhaps allowed themselves to be domesticated and used as gene transmission slaves? Is it a sometimes meandering journey into the mind of an overly curious gardener? Is it a graceful blend of biology, history, psychology, cultural critique, and even mythology? Yes, yes and yes. And it's absolutely brilliant. I even loved that the section on marijuana was slightly more rambling and grandiose - form follows function, after all. "

However, I have to shamefully admit that my ignorance of plants, gardening and possibly nature prevents me from giving this book the 5-star rating it may deserve. The book is divided into 4 parts, each part is about one plant or its product -namely, apple, tulip, marijuana, and potato - and the history of its relationship with humans. I don’t know anything about gardening or flowers, so I often got distracted/bored during the first two parts (apple and tulip). I do know a bit more about marijuana, and got much more engaged in the 3rd part, which I loved. And maybe that engagement continued throughout the 4th part - or something about potatoes, genetically modified plants, and organic food captivated me - because I really enjoyed the 4th part too.

125,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,4,"Totally down for this one and it was fascinating to listen to it. Just like the Standage titles, it's ""the history of something"" in this case-- the natural garden by featuring the apple, the tulip, the marijuana plant, and the potato. It's how the history and future of each plant is a fascinating look at who we are as humans. Sweetness or perfection. Beauty and necessity. Pollan dives in to man and nature by explaining things like biodiversity or genetic modification, adaptability, and so much more. Again, this is the kind of stuff that mixes history with intrigue and piques the interests of nerdy people with passions like where our food comes from or social/emotional connections to beautiful things. It was a nice break to listen to something both informative and comforting with the narrator working well to tell the story and Pollan's humor mixed with good ol' fashioned research. "
126,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37493910-carolyn-harris,3,"This book was hard to categorize. The Botany of Desire is at least three different types of books blended into one: a memoir of the author as a gardener, a history of the world in four plants, and philosophical examination of the relationship between plants and people. None of these approaches are entirely successful. The personal anecdotes scattered throughout the narrative rather than building upon each other. The history is narrow and often focuses on the impact of a plant in a single country such as Johnny Appleseed's efforts to grow cider apples in the United States. The philosophical sections sometimes read like extended digressions from the history and memoir. The selection of plants seemed arbitrary. Why apples and not grapes? Why tulips and not roses? The book had its interesting moments but I much preferred The Omnivore's Dilemma by the same author. "

Most of those seeds would produce fruit used to make hard cider. It just made more economic sense to drink the apples rather than eat them. This book is full of revelations. Tulips, when grown en masse in a single color sometimes ""break"" and produce one contrasting color like a cork bobbing in the ocean. Marijuana helps you to discard your preexisting mental filter and see objects as they really exist. And potatoes are grown in those mysterious irrigated green crop circles that you can spot from an airplane. Too bad that the irrigation devices that feed them sometimes dispense a dangerous poison. Do we dominate nature? Or does nature still have the upper hand? It's a profound question, earnestly explored in this book."

However, focusing on for example Johnny Appleseed when talking about 'the apple', Pollan is well wide of the mark when offering a so called plant's eye view of the world. I was expecting a tale from a Latourian 'material culture' point of view, which would have transferred 'the apple' into an actor without the insuperable need of a human action/actor first. Hence, in my opinion, the apple remains a passive object in his work, which Pollan just tried to avoid: ""(...) Our grammar might teach us to divide the world into active subjects and passive objects, but in a coevolutionary relationship every subject is also an object, every object is a subject(Pollan, 2001, p. xx)"".Nevertheless, the rating of 4 stars is given because of Pollan's exuberant writing style and strong passionate narrative revealing new botanical knowledge for an average layman like me. We can read an interesting personal journey noticing his botanical enthusiasm whilst getting a wide variety of stories and tales.A must read for the passionate botanist, but not for 'the die-hard Latourians' like me."

To me, it’s a gift I have the opportunity to participate in and witness - not something to be controlled or to demonstrate my own might/mastery. As a result, the tone threw me off (especially given the whole point was about how plants have mastered us), and I just put it aside. I believe his approach to gardening was supposed to change over the course of the book, but the author still came off as superior as I progressed through the book. I never finished it. Super interesting premise, but my own stuff (and my never shrinking TBR list) got in the way. Maybe I’ll try again next year with the ebook or physical book.

Taking example of 4 different desires of humans - sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control of nature - and mapping them to 4 plants and looking at the world with the eye view of these plants, offers a fresh perspective on the world we live in.

I felt like he recycled lines, or at a minimum, made the same arguments across both, which, in some sense, means he's building coherence across his opus and in some other sense, is just annoying. I learned a lot about the four subjects: apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. (Throwback to one of the first books I read on regional transit {CalTrain}: Apples are from Kazakhstan.) That's at least one star. Personally, I don't find him pedantic, so that's another star for narrative approach.

There is a a sort of lightness to his writing, even when he writes about heavy things (like Montsanto or the Irish Potato Famine). In Botany of Desire he examines the complex relationship between Man and 4 other classes of organisms: Apples, tulips, ganja and potatoes. He's a good tales-teller and it's never boring with him.

I didn't but I'm glad I do now!Pollan lost me in the marijuana chapter.

I've never gotten high and never felt like I lost that sense of wonder. Does that mean the cannabinoid center of my brain is more turned on that others? There was also some suspect theology that didn't float as well as a ""your brain can power through your depression but take those antidepressant placebos anyway"" kind of stuff.

Actually, no: I got it for free as a kind of gift for being a subscriber but got tired of Audible and its DRM bullshit so I downloaded and listened to a pirated version of this and subsequently unsubscribed from Audible. Ahem.In this surprisingly old book (it was written in 2002) journalist and plant aficionado Michael Pollan takes the well-worn trope of humans using the evolution of plants for their own benefit (i.e. agriculture) and turns its on its head: what if plants have actually used the evolution of humans for their own benefit?Just to clarify, and Mr. Pollan was well-aware of this too, anthropomorphising evolution or nature and endowing it with such properties as intelligence and design (or intelligent design) is a figure of speech: as far as we know evolution is as purposeful as the flowing of the rivers and the burning of the stars. I'll leave that one to you.So, Michael Pollan's idea was to take four species of plants--the tulip, cannabis, the apple and the potato-- and examine how not just we humans have used them for our own needs, but also how the plants themselves, in an evolutionary tango with our own species, played on our desires and took advantage of us, too. The book has four chapters, one for each human desire responsible for the propagation of each of the four species of plant: sweetness for apples, beauty for tulips, intoxication for cannabis and control for potatoes.In the first part of the book, I enjoyed Pollan's comparison between the Dionysian and the Apollonian; chaos and order; female and male; yin and yang; nature and culture; the apple's story and the tulip's story, which both hold the sperms of their opposite inside them, in true dualist nature. I found this quote particularly interesting: ""Great art is born when Apollonian form and Dionysian ecstasy are held in balance"", and it becomes more and more relevant as one goes through the book, seeing in every plant's story the art manifesting itself through the tug--which at the same time is a balancing act--between human structures imposed on nature and nature's tendency to defy control. Then there's structure in nature's chaos and a part that is natural in human structures and so on.The chapter on cannabis was a little more daring, given marijuana's legal status (which is, however slowly, changing around the world) and Mr. Pollan shares his insights on that topic and how human societies brought a species underground, where it's found new life, too. The Apollonian has won, even though the desire itself is Dionysian. Hm. Are all human desires Dionysian, I wonder?The last chapter was about GMOs and Monsanto's control on patented potato seeds, including many many other agricultural plants of course. It's amazing and telling that this chapter, written 12 years ago, seems to sketch the current situation so eloquently. Even though I come from a family background which is 100% anti-GMO, the arguments posited here about the pros and cons of GMOs as well as the pros and cons of organic agriculture seemed very well balanced and neutral to me, and most of all well-argued; in a few words, as close to an objective view as I could hope for. It's still pro-organic, but cleverly so: it adds an interesting twist from a philosophical, pragmatical and experiential perspective--e.g. the story of the writer's own batch of GMO potatoes. I would even suggest reading this chapter alone for a nice eagle's eye view of what's wrong with GMOs, what they're supposedly trying to solve and why they're most probably not going to solve it, creating other unforeseeable problems along the way.Pollan managed to blend personal experience with journalistic research quite seamlessly and enjoyably, and I feel as though I came out of this read listen more complete and with a greater sense of appreciation for agriculture. Cause you can't have agriculture without culture. I'm not giving it five stars because... oh I can't come up with a reason, but hey, I don't have to give you one, it's my gut score! It might have to do with the reader of the audiobook whose voice and intonation sometimes annoyed me. I'd give it a 4.5 though, easily.Thanks go to Karina for first telling me about this book two years ago or so."

169,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1610514-nancy-lewis,4,"Pollan begins by claiming that plants have used people to their advantage for thousands of years. By having the traits that humans find most desirable, we are much more likely to spread their seeds, and at the same time kill the plants we don't like. So instead of seeing the slash and burn of the South American rain forests as a travesty of unprecedented biological loss, we should see it as a win for prairie grass. But the common thread that connects the four plants discussed in this book (apples, tulips, marajuana, and potatoes) is that they are all cultivated by humans through cloning. That doesn't sound like we're helping to spread the genes of these plants - helping them take over the world. We have merely selected a few plants that tickle our fancy and tossed the rest in the can. By the end of the last chapter - the one on potatoes and genetic engineering - the reader is apt to think that maybe human interference in botanical processes is not such a good thing after all. "
170,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5872058-karen,4,"Overall, I greatly enjoyed this fascinating and worthwhile read - once I was able to get into it. The first two chapters struck me as a warm-up for the last two on Marijuana and the potato, which are by far the most compellingly written pieces of the work. It's not that the chapters on apples and tulips are bad (they are both fascinating in their own right), but because Pollan is a journalist and not a historian, he is able to tie his historical arguments together most strongly when the material has present-day and future implications. After the initial few pages, I found Pollan's first chapter difficult to keep engaged with. As he toured around with William Ellery Jones, the local Ohio ""expert"" on Johnny Appleseed, I had the sensation of reading portions of Tony Horowitz's expeditions in the south in his book ""Confederates in the Attic,"" except that in comparison to Howowitz, Pollan's attempt at narrating his adventures in travel with local (and highly prejudiced) guides was clumsey and never reached any insightful conclusion or even supported the plot in a particularly meaningful way. The conclusions Pollan reaches regarding the hazards of America's War on Drugs and the commercial push for GMOs and further industrialization of our food sources, are certainly convincing and should give us all pause concerning our individual role in this march of western 'progress'. Although not well spelled out, underlying Pollan's work is the idea that the daily decisions we make, whether to spring a few bucks more for the organic potatos or to purchase the ""cheaper"" non-organic ones (cheaper is in quotes to denote that there are more factors in the cost of agriculture that the actual monetary price we pay), or to buy a type of apples we've never heard of from a local farmer instead of those ubiquitous Red Delicious variety from a chain market, has implications far beyond our next meal. Perhaps most crucially, (and again Pollan dances around this conclusion without ever being blunt) is that our continued support of fast food chains, such as McDonald's, who control vast amount of our farms (and meat industry) by dictating the kind, method, and manner of what is grown and how it is raised. ""Pollan the Gardner"" certainly sees the need for biodiversity and agriculture practices that supports the health of all levels of the ecosystem, but ""Pollan the Westerner"" still struggles with love of convenience and uniformity of getting the same fries from McDonalds in Idaho as he does in Connecticut. Ultimately, he concludes, though somewhat clandestinely, it is an untenable position, as he shows through the Tulipmania example, and in the future we will have to make changes to cope with the stresses we inflict on the ecosystem. Whether we chose to sacrifice convenience and monetary costs for a system that is designed to work more like the way nature intended, or whether we meet these needs through continued and bioengineering whose products are of questionable safety and whose very methods are propelling us to this brink will be up to us; but it is clear to Pollan that this is a bridge we will be crossing. Important to note, is that far from this work being a doomesday scenario, Pollan shows his readers that public outcry can influence behemoth companies to change, as evidenced by Monsanto discontinuing their New Leaf potato after McDonald's canceled its contract for them after public concerns over GMOs. As a historian, I would have liked to have had footnotes citing his sources for specific information, but this criticism is more of a commentary about the problem of reading ""smart books"" published by non-academic presses who believe that the inclusion of such citations will scare off their readership, than it is of Pollan specifically. I will add that a great deal of Pollan's most fascinating asides and sharpest commentary are to be found in his ""star notes"" which occur with regularity throughout the work, and I urge readers not to skim over them. Now that I have read the work, I am looking forward to viewing the documentary."

The book's tagline is ""a plant's eye view of the world"" but it felt like more of ""a human eye's view of plants""- which just took me down a different path than I expected. I definitely learned some fascinating anecdotes about different plant species (minor spoilers ahead): bighorn sheep eat hallucinogenic lichens, 2 color tulips are created by a virus, Johnny Appleseed was an actual guy but his real name was John Chapman and he is often shown in paintings with a metal pot for a hat and how Monsanto can claim a potato as intellectual property. We love a good anecdote! This book just didn't have that I-can't-wait-to-get-back-to-reading-this feeling for me. It felt like a bit of work to get to the end but maybe if it had been trimmed down a bit to some of the more interesting tidbits, it would have been a more engaging read front to back.

172,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12797993-megan-k,4,"We tend to think of domestication as the act of manipulating a plant or animal to fit our needs as humans. We never stop to consider the idea that it might be the other way around.In The Botany of Desire: A Plant’s-Eye view of the World, Michael Pollan challenges the typical idea of domestication by suggesting that plants adapt to our desires in order to survive. At first the thought of plants domesticating humans sounded ridiculous, but as I began to read, my opinions quickly changed. By using plants from his garden, the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato, he demonstrates how the human desires of sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control allowed these plants to thrive.  “Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served…” (196)Pollan uses periods in history to support this notion of plants using humans. He suggests that all throughout history plants have been domesticating people. His examples range from John Chapman, also known as Johnny Appleseed, introducing the apple to the frontier to the Dutch’s obsession with the tulip to the society of marijuana growers and potatoes being Ireland’s saviors. This really opened my eyes to the fact that his argument could be valid.“Henry David Thoreau once wrote that ‘it is remarkable how closely the history of the apple tree is connected with that of man,’ and much of the American chapter of that story can be teased out of Chapman’s story.” (5)“The potato might not have presented a picture of order or control in the field, yet it gave the Irish a welcome measure of control over their lives.” (200)Along with the historical evidence, Pollan also uses many anecdotes to prove his argument. He discusses how he as a child would plant tulips in his parent’s garden, and as an avid gardener he tested a new genetically enhanced potato created by Monsanto. Since he grows each of the plants in the book, he’s had personal experiences with all of them. From reading his experiences, I could really understand how important his garden is to him and how passionate he is about this topic. This provided him with a lot of credibility in my eyes, which helped me to believe his initial idea about these plants.“The tulip was my first flower, or at least the first flower I ever planted…” (61)“… I watched my NewLeafs [potatoes] multiply their lustrous, dark green leaves those first few days…” (194)As I read this book I found that it reminded me of a history and science text book mixed together. At one point I would be reading about how the Dutch would plant as many tulips in there garden as they could to prove their wealth, and then on the next page I would read about how the colorful “breaks” in the tulips were actually a result of a virus in the flower. I’m generally not a big fan of science, but I do absolutely love history. Pollan incorporating history in this scientific book kept me interested in what I was reading.Since this whole book is more or less based on a very scientific concept, the language used was partly made up of scientific names of things. Pollan used words such as “Cannabi sativa X indica” and “Malus Domestica” which was sometimes confusing, but if he didn’t have these names it wouldn’t sound like he really knew that much about what he was talking about. His word choice, like his personal experiences, gave him authority."

176,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6074747-riley-nilsen,4,"The Botany of Desire expresses our most desirable needs through the way of four plants; the apple, tulip, cannabis, and potato. These cultivated items reflect our needs of sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control. Michael Pollan compares humans to the way of the bee for example; how our desirable needs benefit that of the plant and help it adapt to our evolving ways, just like the bee benefits from the flowers nectar and pollen to make honey. His view is different and interesting. I have grown a respect for the author as he makes some absurd assertions yet uses outstanding research and facts to prove his point well. Although my ideals may not align with his, we share the common interest of agriculture, his, a more liberal perspective than mine. While the four plants express four different themes, I found the tulip’s story the most interesting. Years ago, people were mad for the perfect tulip. It created a “tulipomania” in Holland and the economy thrived off of this simple plant. It represented strength and wealth, which are direct reflections of our modern human beauty. A tulip stood strong as its one stem reached tall and its vibrant colors attracted an emotional connection. If a solid red tulip was born amongst a field of yellow ones, people went crazy, paying large sums of money and desiring its unique gene. A lot like today, people go to the greatest of lengths to stand out and be the most beautiful amongst a group of averages. Ironically, this red flower was soon to be found deathly and carried a virus. Could the lengths we go to in order to be beautiful, rich and unique be deathly? Maybe? The idea ‘survival of the fittest’ is what kept the tulip alive and why being beautiful sadly the only way to be on top. But maybe if the ‘average’ yellow tulips were to be admired every once in a while, our idea of beauty can finally change, thus not deathly anymore.The book was recommended to me by Mr. Bruce, my AP teacher. I must say, it opened my mind up to a new way to look not just at these four plants, but what possibly could be in control of us. Although, at times I found parts to be a little wacky or not practical, the overall idea of the book was enlightening. He had surprising and thoughtful points throughout his novel which might have been ‘off the wall’ but honestly thought invoking all the same. Even if you aren’t a lover of plants and its vital role, I would still recommend this book because of it impressive ability to make readers think differently and grow a respect for the environment around, for after all, they could be dominate species of our planet. (For my personal insight, while reading this book, keep in mind our massive population, high consumer demands, reality that only 2%of Americans are farmers and most people live in compact cities and not off the river traveling, planting apple seedlings)."
177,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16294266-madhulika-liddle,5,"The general perception of humans when it comes to their relationship with plants is that it is we who control them.. We who decide - and have decided, over many millennia, which plants to cultivate, which to nurture, and which to declare weeds and wage war upon. Unlike animals—which, thanks to locomotion, are able to have a more visible effect on human life—plants more often than not tend to get pushed to the periphery of our collective consciousness. At any rate, most of us do not think plants capable of having much of an influence on our lives, let alone our politics, our societies, our economies. In The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of The World, Michael Pollan sets out to investigate just how deep-rooted mankind's relationship with plants actually is, and how—in many times and many places throughout history—plants have actually succeeded in changing history. This Pollan does this by looking at four very specific plants, each connected with one very specific human desire: apples (the desire for sweetness); tulips (the desire for beauty); cannabis (the desire for intoxication); and potatoes (the desire for control). One by one, in a long chapter devoted to each of these plants, Pollan dissects its history: botanical, social, political, economic and more. The result is a brilliantly engrossing, informative and entertaining insight into how humans have influenced plants and how plants have influenced humans. With research that ranges from growing his own Monsanto-engineered NewLeaf potatoes to visiting a vast apple research institute which grows hundreds of varieties—all the way from Kazakhstan, home of the 'original' apple—Pollan takes a close and intense look at plants. How tulips, through the 'Tulipomania' that hit medieval Holland, leading speculators to invest enormous sums of money on each flower (and, still later, on the mere promise of a flower). How American folk legend John 'Johnny Appleseed' Chapman went along the frontier, laboriously planting apple orchards from seed. How apples grow, how potatoes are genetically engineered. How cannabis works on the brain. How the French court worked to popularise potatoes. Why the Andean farmers, despite living pretty much solely on potatoes, never suffered disaster like their 19th century Irish counterparts. I finished this book with a sense of deep satisfaction, because I had learnt so much (some of it historical, some scientific - everything, in fact, from witchcraft and genetics to religion and philosophy). Some of it was 'I hadn't known that!' trivia; some—like the disturbing truth about exactly how genetic engineering works, and what its repercussions can be—was an eye-opener. And all of it written in Pollan's extremely readable, sometimes humorous, always entertaining style. A winner of a book. "
178,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"""The Botany of Desire"" seems to me to be Michael Pollan's strangest, most varied, and most theoretically-labored book. Despite this, it's still charming, and at turns demonstrates his strengths as an essayist and as a journalist. However, I think this book doesn't fulfill the promise and ambition of its main concept.The book has a very compelling concept, namely that it is instructive to look as the success of particular plant species under human cultivation not as a human achievement, but as plants successfully evolving attributes to manipulate us to better propagate. In a similar structure to many of his other books, the organizing principle is a set of themes, here some of the attributes plants might deploy: sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control. This framework opens up some very powerful and broad analysis. We could compare the spread of species over human history, looking to land use and proliferation of species, and the change in their qualities over time. This theme is appropriate for understanding the overall effect of cultivation on Earth's ecology. There could be a lot to say about, for example, the history of beauty and control in the offerings at supermarkets and it's corresponding effects throughout the food system.Instead, a narrower path is selected, and each of these themes is explored through a particular species. Sweetness: the apple, beauty: the tulip, intoxication: cannabis, and control: the potato. This narrowed focus also then extends chronologically, which the apple focusing on westward settlement in the USA, the tulip on the Amsterdam tulip craze, cannabis on the USA ""War on Drugs"", and potatoes on biotechnological developments applied to the potatoes commonly used in fast food french fries. Each of these is along a spectrum from journalism to essay, with my assessment being potato, cannabis, apple, and tulip. I think the more journalistic work is strongest, though the essay-like aspect were nice but repetitive. As a person who generally refrains from intoxicants, I strongly appreciated the attempt to bridge the pharmacological and phenomenological effects of cannabis gave me a fascinating perspective into a different set of experiences.An unabridged audiobook is not the most helpful format for this book, as it's quite long-winded when read out loud. In particular, the repeated musings on Nietzsche's distinction between the Dionysian and Apollonian in our relationship with plants did the audio format no favors. Listening to this book on drive, we found we needed breaks from listening. Scott Brick is an effective narrator, though I enjoy the personalized touch of Pollan himself reading (such as in the ""Cooked"" audiobook).Overall, this book retains interest, but would have had a stronger focus had it take a broader view."
179,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3861806-emily,4,"This book was an interesting read. I learned some of the ways humans have cultivated plants and the desires behind them. I like how the book is broken into 4 parts, each a type of desire. My favorite chapter was the one on Marijuana for the fact that it illustrates how different plants have profound effects on human consciousness. I liked how he tied his explanations in with Darwinism as well as Greek mythology, comparing Johnny Appleseed as a man between worlds, much like the greek god Pan or Dionysius. In the chapter on beauty, it was interesting to read about symmetry and the elemental principles of beauty, why it exists in plants. I learned that bees are just as much pollinators of plants as we are and how coevolution between plants and animals has evolved to the state it is now. Here are some of my notes/summary:Desire: Sweetness (The Apple):Bees and humans both have criteria for selection, bees: symmetry and sweetness. Humans, heft and nutritional valuePlants care about what every being cares about: making more copies of itself. Plants have induced animals and people to spread their genes.Coevolution: food for the bee, transportation for the apple genes.We think of domestication as something we do to other species, but it makes just as much sense to think of it as something animals and plants have done to us, an evolutionary strategy for advancing their own interests.Plants make chemicals both to attract and repel other species because of immobility. SAngiosperms: plants that produce flowers and encased seeds. Appeared during the Cretaceous period. Plants could now rely on animals instead of wind or water to move genes. Nutrition in exchange for transportation.Angiosperms multiplied the world's supply of food energy, giving rise to large warm-blooded mammalsEvolution doesn't depend on will or intention to work, it is, almost by definition an unconscious, unwilled process.In a coevolutionary relationship, every subject is also an objectArtificial selection: the process by which domesticated species come into the world.

It's also a sign of health in a creature since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it.Different kinds of bees are attracted to different symmetry. Honeybees favor the radial symmetry of daisies, clover, and sunflowers, whil bumblebees prefer the bilateral symmetry of orchids, peas, and foxglovesThe elemental principles of beauty are contrast and patternGenes carry reflections of peoples ideasThe more perfect the symmetry, the healthier and sweeter the flowerAnthocyanin: a second laid-out color.

Pollan offers an accessible and immersive look at the co-evolution of people and four common plants--apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes, all of which have been shaped by us to conform to our aesthetic taste and nutritional wants and needs, while the plants themselves subtly change how we farm, eat and experience the world."
181,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4834343-martha,5,"I have read a few of Pollan's books which are filled with critically important information about biotech agriculture but this book is my favourite. In it, he tells the stories of four domesticated plants - the apple, the tulip, cannabis, and the potato - a fruit, a flower, a leaf and a root. He follows them through history, looking into both their impact on people and our impact on them. In summation, he shows that it is the plants that are controlling us and the plants are enjoying being taken to the far corners of the earth to reproduce and spread their genes.In the apple story, we see our futile desperation to keep strains of apple varieties pure, despite the fact that apples do not reproduce true to type. With the tulip, our efforts to create more vivid colours are spreading a virus to all tulips varieties which causes them to colour break more often. Cannabis has enjoyed our cultivation for thousands of years, thanks to its potent THC, and has been enjoyed by many a free-thinker over those years but still feared as a demon by The War on Drugs. The potato is undergoing frighteningly haphazard genetic modifications to alleviate the pressures of pests and to feed Corporate America's fix for sameness,Pollan's writing skill lies in his straight-forwardness with the facts and his ability to present them without preaching but simply with logic. He partners his own research experiences with both facts and myths, peppered with historical anecdotes to place those facts/myths in another context and to help us see a pattern though time. Many times while reading, I had 'a-ha' moments where his descriptions made everything crystal clear and I was left wondering why I hadn't seen the truth before.My two favourite quotes:Cannibis - Christianity and capitalism are both probably right to detest a plant like cannabis. Both faiths bid us to set our sights on the future; both reject the pleasures of the moment and the senses in favor of the expectation of a fulfillment yet to come - whether by earning salvation or by getting and spending.The Potato -Here, then, is a whole other meaning of the word monoculture. Like the agricultural practice that goes by that name, this one too - the monoculture of global taste - is about uniformity and control. A five star account that everyone should read."

Pollan argues that the sweetness of the apple, the beauty of the tulip, the intoxication of marihuana, and the control offered by the potato have shaped humankind - not the other way around.I was kind of enjoying this book's combination of botany and cultural history (a la Malcolm Gladwell) until I hit the section on marijuana and the tenuous connections Pollan draws between it and religion. I just couldn't. I don't buy it when writers offer thinly supported materialistic explanations of religious phenomena, and I found Pollan's ponderings on the ""profound"" thoughts experienced by those who are high ridiculous. Also, his metaphors and literary references are sometimes a stretch that require too much credulity for me to follow. (Johnny Appleseed is not Dionysius. Sorry. No.)I couldn't even make it to the potato, which is a shame because I love potatoes.The best part of the book for me came near the end of the first section on apples, when Pollan visits a tree library full of seeds that come from Kazakhstan, the cradle of the original apple tree. His description of the tulip bulb speculation craze in Holland barely touches on a very interesting time in history, one I would love to read a book about. If there had been more history and science, and less pseudo-philosophical maundering, I would have enjoyed it more (and probably finished it).But it's the kind of layman's science and history that has stopped seeming clever to me because these books tend to be sloppy with the details - too caught up in drawing broad, easy conclusions from sketchy knowledge. Journalists rarely make great science writers when short pieces are made book-length.If you loved this book, sorry.

183,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028300-glen-engel-cox,4,"Michael Pollan’s The Botany of Desire is a collection of four essays on four different plants, each representing a desire that humans have: apples (sweetness), tulips (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and potatoes (control). Pollan’s writing is clear and purposeful, full of the kind of rampant speculation that would get a real scientist in trouble (or labeled as a “pop scientist” as Carl Sagan was), but perfect for the gardener-turned-investigator that Pollan is. In high school, we learn that plots boil down to basic structures, one of them being human vs. nature. Pollan attempts to flip that and write a book that is nature vs. humans by focusing on how the plants benefit from the years of selection by humans. Although the book is ostensibly about the plants, Pollan introduces you to a number of people who provide both the assistance and the foils for his natural protagonists, like: Johnny Appleseed (a real figure) and Bill Jones (who is more interested in a St. Appleseed); Monsanto, their captive customers, and the off-the-grid organic farmer Mike Heath; Bryan R., a breeder and grower of marijuana in Amsterdam, who is both frightened and proud of his patch of weed; and Dr. Pauw, who owned all but one of the most desired tulips during the mania that hit Holland.The style of the book resembles that of John McPhee, partly because of its four-essay structure, but also in the short, broken sections that flit back-and-forth in time, place and thought. Pollan, unlike McPhee, has a conclusion to draw from his subject, though, and that is the need to support biodiversity and his fear of monoculture–be it a natural one like the reliance on the “lumper” potato in Ireland that led to the Great Potato Famine or the artificial one of human culture, where people show a range of interest on many things, not just the tulip (or dot.com) of the moment. Reading between the lines, one can celebrate not only the wonder of nature but also fear the danger of hubris in thinking that we are separate from that nature, that we are not as changed by it as we change it. In these days of global warming and other environmental pressures, it’s a lesson we would all do well to heed."
184,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47412-lynnvariety,4,"For anyone even slightly interested in the human relationship with domesticated plants, this book is a key read. Pollan's approach (full disclosure: I've applied to the journalism school where he's a prof) combines research and observation to create a fascinating introspection on this relationship. He tells of the domestication of apples, tulips, potatoes and marijuana, but more than that, he ponders the four human desires that have driven us to cultivate these plants. The final, somewhat understated conclusion is that our influence on the natural world reflects our own nature as humans. This is more eloquently and subtly revealed in Pollan's writing than I anticipated, since the book was largely billed as an expose of the plant-world's manipulation of humanity for their own propogation. While that is a thought-provoking concept, and Pollan does explore it in less absolute terms, it's much more simplistic than what the author proposes.Historical offerings in this book are gems. ~ SPOILER ~ Johnny Appleseed? Once engaged to a child bride, this nature-worshipping evangelical mainly sold apple trees for the production of hard cider. The Drug War? Led to domestic cultivation of previously unknown marijuana strains that pack much more of a whallop. ~ END SPOILER ~ Current facts about genetic modification in potatoes are also sobering and informative. In fact, the historical plant relationships Pollan describes inform the current potato relationship deeply. Reckless Dutch prospecting on tulips echoes in the current state of Big Ol Corporate AgriBusiness, not in the sense that the potato market will soon fail, but in that a desire for control and uniformity in plant production has been in bed with the desire for cash for quite some time. What's more, this combination can lead to problematic decision making, whether it be the creation of a futures market with no future (tulips), or in the commodification of plant genes by patent-mongering seed distributors.Pollan is surely one of the most important food and environmental writers of our time, and I plan to read his other books soon."
185,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,4,"This book was another fascinating look into the codependent relationships between humans and four specific plants.The apple chapter interested me a lot, since much of the historical action takes place in Ohio and Indiana. It was also a revelation, which seems obvious in hindsight, that Johnny Appleseed was planting cider orchards rather than for fruit crops. It also mentions about the hybridization of American apple varieties and the ways apples from seed will vary greatly from previous generations.The chapter on marijuana was also interesting in discussing how its chemicals affect the brain, why it would be beneficial for a plant to produce such chemicals, and why human brains even have receptors for cannabinoids. It is nice to have this topic covered in a relatively neutral way from a person who neither lionizes nor demonizes the drug too much.The last chapter about a GMO potato plant was very engaging. Again, while Pollan has greater reservations about GMOs than I do, he covers it in a very thoughtful and engaging manner. I find the science of GMOs fascinating, although the worry that they may accelerate disease and pest resistance is very legitimate. Generally, my concerns over GMOs focus on the intellectual property aspects, and how farmers must license the seeds annually, rather than being able to own and replant the organisms. GMOs having the potential of ""Terminator"" genes which would make the seeds grown sterile are also a bit frightening. Much of this chapter focuses on the effects of monoculture in planting and the commercial reasons for it. This monoculture often necessitates the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and more recently GMOs. He also keeps on discussing the Dionysian and the Apollonian; wild, chaotic, disorder, and shaped, patterned, order. Apparently much of that discussion is from Friedrich Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy. That might be worth a read too..."
186,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,5,"So...This book was GREAT.The author talks about the mutual relationship between humans and plants through history and now by looking at the cases of apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes.The book promises a ""plant's-eye view"" of how these domestic crops have, in fact, ""cultivated"" humans. I think it doesn't deliver on that as much as simply showing that the relationship isn't COMPLETELY human-controlled. I still find it hard to think of plants as manipulators of humans. He doesn't dispel the idea that plants have to compete to please US and WE choose our favorites.That aside, this book is:-Really interesting: It has everything from the real history of Johnny Appleseed to how flowers, fruits and plants embody the qualities of ancient gods (or literally played a part in shaping religions), how common plants come from quirky genetic ancestors, how some ""domesticated"" plants still have qualities that can't be tamed, and how the author grows things in his own garden (including when he tests a genetically engineered potato).-Written almost perfectly: The author is poetic without sounding conceited or hard to understand. He has a lot of great metaphors and themes that he comes back to time and again, giving readers something familiar and likable even when talking about complicated stuff. He uses the gods Apollo and Dionysus to represent the gardener's urge for order versus plants' wildness. You get some culture without thinking too much about it. -Researched really well. History, culture, gardening, genetics and botany, philosophy and religion...he goes into all of that. Successfully....somehow. And somehow it's not dull and overly fact-y.-He works in controversy over genetic engineering without condeming the genetic engineers or the people who have a problem with their practices. He shows his own uneasiness with genetic engineered potatoes without suggesting that everyone has to feel that way, or feel it to the same degree. "

The Botany of Desire is a blending of everything about plants: natural history, cultivation, social history, biology and genetic engineering, and a dip into neuroscience. There are four plants discussed in this book: apple, tulip, marijuana and potato, which are a fruit, a flower, a drug and a staple food.Previously only having learned a little about Dutch Tulip Mania and Irish Potato Famine, I am totally entertained as well as educated by Michael Pollan. Johnny Appleseed and the role of apple trees in America colony? Never heard of. The story of marijuana is brand new to me. I am glad to have read something about this plant as the legalisation of marijuana is spreading nowadays. Since people throughout the history have been trying to alter their consciousness and will continue to attempt, perhaps the the inevitable choice is to thoroughly study drugs such as marijuana in open daylight instead of making it a taboo.Potato plant was domesticated in South America, not in Europe or Asia. What a captivating story about its role in feeding Irish poor, boosting the population, only two centuries later triggering the death and migrations of millions (how the fate of humans and plants is thoroughly intertwined!) The most disturbing part the controversial Monsanto and its GMOs. As someone who loves science, I have almost no problems with GMOs. However, Michael Pollan makes me think from a nature-centred angle, even I don't fully share his suspicions. Making genetic modified crops, especially when controlled by profit-driven big corporations, as solution to current problems in mass agriculture, perhaps is not as sustainable and safe to the creatures on earth (not excluding human) for the ecological system as the corporations lead us to believe."

At no point did I really feel inclined to put the book down, in that sense it was so well written it engaged me. Despite this, it was a bit to immersed in popular culture. As much as that can be interesting. I eventually get sick of even thoughtful commentary about the stuff. When it came to the part about Mcdonalds I wanted to throw up.. and the author, pollan, doesn't even try to make mcdonalds look bad. He simply states a few facts, its pretty incredible how.... effective writting coupled with a neutral position can present things how they are so well. I enjoyed reading about the apple tree and discovering its facinating history. I sometimes felt like his premise was too much of an advertisement. There really didn't seem that much weight after all to the statement that plants control humans more than we might think. He builds up this big idea as if to talk about it. But I didn't really feel like it happened, much of the book still ended up being about what humans do to plants.I still agree with him, in the sense that I think tulips have evolved to please humans as a way of prospering. This seems like a good point. But he didn't talk to much about what potatoes do? It seems that the notion of plants as controllers was only relevent to... tulips and marijuana. Potatoes and apples seem to pretty obviously products of humans. Their inherent wildness is pretty much gone... after grafting and altering.Over all it was a pretty interesting book. Perhaps I don't quite understand the thesis.I think the title pretty accurately describes it. It was definitely was to do with botany and desire.I think the idea of sweetness, and how powerful that would have been for early settlers of the west. How that sweetness has been corrupted."
189,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This is quite an interesting book. Pollan chooses four different plants and associates them with four different human desires, and then he presents a fascinating account of each plant-desire duo. There’s a host of good and interesting information in the book not only on human nature and botany, but history as well. What moved this book from three to four stars for me was the writing. There are passages in the book that are quite a joy to read if you don’t really care that much for the subject matter.The duos are: 1) Apple-Sweetness: This is the most interesting chapter for the history that it presents. If you’re like me and never heard of Johnny Appleseed before and don’t know the history of apple in America and how it moved from primarily being drunk in the form of cider to being eaten, then you need to read this chapter. 2) Tulip-Beauty: Aesthetics and – predictably – a recount of the Dutch tulip mania. 3) Cannabis-Intoxication: Sticky-icky-icky! Oooooweeeee! Put it in the air! His theory about how cannabis's erasure of our short-term memory leads to the revival of our childlike sense of wonder is actually quite convincing. 4) Potato-Control: I was wondering what potato had to do with control. Pollan has picked potato as an example of a plant that our modern technology has reshaped in its imagination so that to assert control over nature. So now we have a genetically-modified potato that grows with pesticide programmed into its DNA. What can such tampering with nature have in store for us? He retells the story of the Irish famine and reminds us of how fooling around with nature - forgoing the biodiversity practiced by the Inca farmers and instead bringing and growing a single type of potato in Ireland and effectively inviting a complete wipe-out by a single pest - led to the decimation of an entire nation."
190,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191652-bill,4,"This book is mind-bending. First of all, Pollan’s prose is so beautiful that it is a pleasure to read. But then, he takes that fluid prose, and tells the story of how people and plants co-evolve, through three plants: apples, tulips and marijuana. The idea that we co-evolve with plants is, in itself, one of those perspective shifts that left me disoriented and tumbled upside down until Pollan gently set me down in a new paradigm. Think about it. When human beings arrived on the scene, plants (and animals) that mutated to serve the desires of human beings ended up with a competitive advantage. So instead of thinking that we are breeding apples or flowers or marijuana to serve our needs, you can think of the plants finding a way to multiply and flourish by enticing us to serve their reproductive demands. In truth, it isn’t all one way or the other. Hence, co-evolution.The story of apples is full of amazing discoveries about Johnny Appleseed, who, in addition to his eccentricities, also turns out to have been a masterful businessman and land speculator; about the reason settlers wanted apple trees (mostly for hard cider!); and the effects of the market concentration in a small number of genetic breeds. The story of tulips not only covers the Tulip Craze in the Netherlands but also compares the way different cultures value different things in flowers and notes that human preference for a particular pattern of tulip (called “Breaks”) ended up improving the survival of a particular kind of tulip virus. The marijuana story is funny (and includes Pollan’s own close brush with the law) and scary (modern marijuana is way more powerful than only a few decades ago and is grown in bizarre indoor environments).Read. Enjoy. Then puzzle over the next apple that you eat."
191,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3966958-maegan,5,"I first encountered this book in a class called Plants and Human Affairs during my second semester in college. When we started reading it I couldn't really imagine getting into a book about plants...it just doesn't sound all that thrilling. I could not have been more wrong. This book gives you a picture of plant evolution from a plant's perspective. It asks not what we are doing to assert control over these plants but how they are actively manipulating us to evolve. We live with the idea that was ""domesticate"" our plants without considering how they have used us to propagate their species. That idea alone is enough to make you stop right there and wonder.In this book Pollan explains the history of plant evolution, how co-evolution works, and how the desires and needs of humans have driven plant evolution. He takes the story of four plants - apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. He matches these plants with four human desires - sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control, and wrote four captivating chapters filled with history, trivia, and science. You will never look at any of these plants in the same way again. He warns us against the dangers of mono-culture and the loss of variety in biological organisms that results from it.You do not need to be a botanist or even an avid gardener to enjoy this book. Anyone who has ever been in the produce section of a grocery store will appreciate what Pollan has to say. This is a fantastic read for the non-scientist. Pollan doesn't put on heirs. He lays out his thoughts as if you were a friend sitting with him in the backyard, drinking some iced tea, watching the bees diligently making love to all their flowers, and considering what we might have in common with them."
192,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2039269-sheila,5,"The co-evolution of plants and mankind seems designed to be viewed from the perspective of the seven deadly sins, but Michael Pollan takes a nicely squared-off look at the topic through just four plants. Sweetness (the apple), beauty (the tulip), intoxication (marijuana) and control (the potato) form the human basis of this tale of mutable and mutating flora and fauna. Combining familiar stories (including Johnny Appleseed), history (including the Irish potato famine),botany, genetics and more in a pleasingly readable text, the author successfully challenges social assumptions (insect-free harvesting is good for example) without digressing into radical condemnation. A very human curiosity invites the reader to ponder and wonder delightfully, while enjoying a text rich with fascinating digressions and just deep enough to impart the odd lesson in science, myth and history.Yes, I know that plants don’t “care,” and the author knows it too. But the image of plants manipulating us, rather than us enjoying the imagined power of manipulating ourselves, is certainly one that awakens the mind and inspires the reader to stop and think a bit. Next time I see a field of potatoes I might ponder on how we harvest sheep as well, and wonder if they too might be vulnerable to the great unknown that can suddenly wipe out a monocultured crop.I’d like to see the TV series, but I’m reviewing this from the point of view of someone who hasn’t. I enjoyed the smooth writing, the self-deprecating tone, and the gentle lessons imparted. I’m still not an expert, but I am at least a slightly more interested and educated amateur in this fascinating world of co-evolution.Disclosure: Our book group chose to read this book and I enjoyed it. I’m hoping I might enjoy the discussion too."
193,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7838012-dawn,1,"The main problem I had with The Botany of Desire was with the continual use of teleological language throughout the book, beginning as early as the introduction. Even though Pollan gives an initial caveat that plants aren’t really capable of conscious motivation, he then goes on to speak as though they are throughout the rest of the book. This gives an inaccurate view of the processes involved in both natural selection and in the relationships between plants and humans during the processes of artificial selection. While plants don’t “intend” to achieve a particular end when a random mutation occurs in their DNA (whether or not that mutation leads to an overall benefit to the species), humans do frequently intend a particular end when breeding new varieties of domesticated plants. In this sense, the relationship between humans and plants in the domestication process is not as equally directional as Pollan’s language implies. We are not as consciously “used” by plants to the same intentional degree as we use them.What I did enjoy in the book was the social history aspect of the presentation of the four domesticated crops. While the book fails at conveying the biological aspect of the domestication process, it does extremely well at explaining the ways that we have modified specific plants to meet our changing needs and desires.Pollan does get a little abstract at times, as when he likens Johnny Appleseed to a liminal figure and American manifestation of Dionysus. Dionysian vs. Apollonian tensions in agriculture is a major theme throughout the book. Many readers may not be expecting so much philosophy and so little botany. Be prepared for a highly abstract and philosophical ride."

It has 4 chapters; 4 subject matters: How human interactions (desires) have affected the evolution of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. The apple and the tulip, the first two chapters, were not half as good as the others, so I’m glad I got through them at least. Mr. Pollan really does seem to know what he's talking about here. But the comparisons between The Apollonian and Dionysian in every chapter, really almost on every page, made me so tired (yawn).I found some tidbits the author threw out in each chapter to be riveting; at least one point stood out for me in each:1. The first apples grown in America (think Johnny Appleseed times) were foul tasting and used only for cider and alcoholic drinks. Way too much information on Johnny here. 2. A truly black tulip is an impossibility to achieve, but they seem to keep trying. 3. Due to the more stringent laws of recent decades (thanks in part to Ronald Reagan), marijuana growing has moved indoors where it can be forced to flower faster; thus a more robust end product. An indoor grower can create a “utopia for the plants, a habitat more perfect than any in nature.” THC levels have risen from 2-3% per plant to 20% when this book was written. Ronnie, are you spinning in your grave? And the factoid on why witches ride brooms was oh so interesting.4. Potatoes – Just a fascinating chapter through and through, especially the plight of our farmers under the control of corporations like Monsanto. This chapter really made me ponder the future of our farmers and food industry. "

What is refreshing about this book is how he tries to think from the plant's perspective about humans, the idea of domestication (""who is domesticating whom, really?""), and their relation to human in our search for meaning and ownership of the world.

196,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3105258-lynette,5,"Another winner by the author of The Omnivore's Dilemma, which I loved also. This book was written before Dilemma, but it adds to what he has to say in the later book. Pollan takes four human desires and matches them with four different plants to illustrate how plants use humans to perpetuate their species just as much as humans use plants. Humans crave Sweetness; the author talks about the apple and how it evolved, taking a side trip with Johnny Appleseed and adding the American angle to the story. Give us Beauty; we go to Holland in the seventeenth century to explore the effect of the tulip on the stock market there. Throughout history mankind has been attracted to Intoxication; Pollan looks at marijuana. And for his last chapters, the subject is Control and the plant is the Potato. Along the way we learn all kinds of fascinating bits and trivia -- which is sometimes not so trivial -- about the history of agriculture and about the need for bio-diversification. Who knew that there was a huge bubble in the stock market in the sixteen-hundreds that was based on future crops of tulips infected with a virus? That people in Europe had to be bribed and otherwise manipulated to accept potatoes as a food crop? That we have been eating genetically-altered potatoes without knowing it? That the banning of marijuana has led to a superior plant with far greater mood-enhancing and medicinal properties?I love the way this author thinks, the way one idea leads him to consider others and how he puts these ruminations together to form theses, which he articulates so beautifully. In the end we learn so much more about the human condition, about what it means to be human."

Pollan covers botany well, but he also brings in history, philosophy, neuroscience, economics and many other fields of interest in this study of 4 plants: apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. As far as non-fiction books go, I can't imagine it being any better.Many other reviewers have complained that he did not stick to his argument that plants, by catering to human desires, actually manipulate humans into doing their bidding, which is basically helping them spread across the globe. Those reviewers are right, but it's just not a big deal to me. This book is more about human and plant interaction, and that's interesting in itself.The chapter on apples is by far the most interesting, but each chapter really brought something new and different to the table. The tulip chapter bored me, but I already knew a bit about ""tulipomania."" I found the marijuana chapter lacking in depth at points, especially the beginning, but was fascinated by his research and theories on how marijuana effects the brain and human consciousness. He ended well with the potato chapter - mixing the potato's history with very interesting speculation on its future in the world of biochemistry and genetic modification. As someone who doesn't really follow agricultural science at all (unlike some people more into the organic movement), I got a lot out of this book in the forms of both general information and a new way to think of plants and food.

198,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,4,"In this book, Michael Pollan recounts the incredible journey of modern apple, tulip, pot, and potato plants, which differ significantly from their wild ancestors due to their co-evolution with humans. Altering key characteristics over time, yielding to human desire, these plants have ensured their multiplication and the spread of their genes. Pollan challenges us to view these botanical success stories from the opposite perspective, as well. In this line of reasoning, it is human culture which has yielded to the destiny of the plant...rafting down the Ohio river with the seeds of intoxication, risking fortunes on the prospect of producing a rare tulip, raising stinky plants without soil or sunlight in order to grow the perfect bud in secrecy, resorting to chemical fertilizers, toxic pesticides and genetic engineering to craft a McDonald's French fry.An analogy which resounds throughout the book is humankind's constant struggle between two classical desires: Apollonian order and Dionysian pleasure. In the garden, on the farm, and in the supermarket, the battle continues day by day. Tender fruit or pest resistance? Larger bloom or sweeter fragrance? Although anyone who buys fruit, vegetables, or flowers will find something to appreciate in this book, the ancient dilemma and its lack of resolution will be most satisfying to those who delight in their own backyard battles: gardeners."

Pollan's writing is superb (he is, after all, a celebrated professor of journalism at U.C. Berkeley, and a prolific author)--elegant prose, great turns of phrases, and lots of original detail. He brings to life a topic that could be dry and boring.I can quibble about some little things: I found lots of repetition in the tulip section (enough already with the Apollonian and Dionysian references, plenty here and throughout the book...); he also incorporates a somewhat limited and genetic reductionist representation of evolutionary processes and mechanisms, relying way too much on the popular writings of Steven Pinker and Richard Dawkins to support his assertions, while omitting many major theorists in evolutionary biology--Stephen Jay Gould, for one (although Lewontin is mentioned in the notes at the end, but never cited in the main text--shame). He only ever mentions E.O. Wilson in the epilogue, if I remember correctly.Additionally, he doesn't interweave more cutting-edge subjects in evolutionary adaptation such as niche construction and complexity theory; however the last section on the potato is excellent in terms of insights into genetic engineering and adaptation, and our 'strange new world'.Overall though, I really enjoyed it. I found the section on marijuana to be the strongest of the four--and most entertaining, with the last section on the potato most disturbing and informative."
200,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/600247-bob-redmond,4,"Pollan writes four eqsuisite chapters, on four anchors of agriculture: the apple (his strongest), the tulip, marijuiana, and the potato. He pushes a thesis, at times awkwardly, that gives contemporary context to Darwin's ideas and present some truly original thought. Pollan acknowleges the ""b"" side of Darwin's natural selection, which is _artificial_ selection: how the intervention of human industry can alter the natural trajectory of species. The original leap is that some species also select _us_. The apple, for instance, calls to humans with equal fervor as we cultivate the apple.Pollans' thematic counterpoint (to his own Apollonian thesis) is a running commentary on the relative order and wildness in the world of plants and humans. It's an interesting throughline that seasons the book and holds it together better than the Darwinian postulating.Pollan is at his best when unearthing the histories of these four elements. The revelatory chapter on the apple alone is worth the price of admission; to avoid spoiling the joy of discovery I can't really say anything about it. The chapter on the potato also synthesizes history, culture, biochemistry, and Pollan's own journalistic experience in the most compelling way.WHY I READ THIS BOOK: At dinner with Amy and our friend Paula, Paula brought up the book and talked about some of the theories of Natural Selection. I learned that Paula had lent Amy this book and it was sitting on our shelf at home. I took it down and got absorbed right away."

I first heard about it from a co-worker, who talked with me about the evils of pesticide-using potato farms and the benefits of cannabis intoxication during a lunch break. The Botany of Desire: A Plant’s Eye View of the World focuses on a theory that Pollan developed which asks the question, “Are we cultivating plants, or are they cultivating us?”There are four main chapters in this book. Each explains the history and use of four plants: apples, tulips, cannabis and potatoes. Apples were originally coveted for their ability to make hard cider - most apples grown from seed are too unpalatable to be enjoyable. Later, they exemplified sweetness at a time when things were not so sweet. Tulips (and other flowers) are prized for their beauty. The Dutch nearly went bankrupt over a blossoming tulip market in the 1600s. Cannabis fulfills the human need for intoxication, and may have played a role in our evolutionary development. Finally, potatoes are a hearty source of vitamins and protein, but many corporations are now growing genetically-modified potatoes to cut down on costs. How will these new potatoes affect our health and the environment? These four plants satisfy four basic human desires, and Pollan does a great job of researching their history and explains it in a captivating story.I really enjoyed this book, and look forward to reading Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemna: A Natural History of Four Meals next.4/5 Stars. 304 pages. Published 2002."
202,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25255950-krista-aoki,3,"I really enjoy Michael Pollan's journalistic style of approaching writing a book through experience.Through the histories of four different plants, Pollan explores how their traits shaped four parts of human desire: sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control.  Part I: Sweetness explores the apple (mostly in an American context), its history, and its evolution. His history of Johnny Appleseed includes some unnecessary details, but overall well-researched.Part II: Beauty talks about the history of humankind (mostly the Dutch) and their fascination with a tulip's beauty. This chapter seems like it would be the gateway to reading about bees. Pollan suggests the desires of bees influence shapes and colors of the tulips. He also emphasizes the importance of botanical paintings (79) illustrating now-extinct tulip bulbs. Part III: Intoxication considers the history and relationship between humans and hallucinogens. Pollan focuses on marijuana, and describes how American prohibition shaped the now stronger strains of this forbidden fruit.Part IV: Control looks at the history of the potato. Pollan explores a comparative aspect of the politics of the potato. Additionally, he looks at Monsanto's NewLeaf Potato and compares it to organic varieties. I applaud the way Pollan used the potato to question corporate content and consumer knowledge.Overall, I found Part I and II a little boring and hard to make it through. However, Pollan's interesting histories and look at politics helped Parts III and IV be much more compelling."

Pollan specifically focuses on 4 crops: apples (sweetness), tulips (beauty), cannabis (intoxication), and potatoes (control), returning often to compare Apollo vs. Dionysis throughout the book. Like all of Pollan's books, very motivating... how can you read about Monsanto and not feel a need to go out and be a change in the world? Pollan quotes a Maine organic farmer, ""If there's a source of evil in agriculture, its name is Monsanto."" Amongst other things, Pollan briefly discusses Monsanto's development of Genetic Use Restriction Technology (i.e. terminator genes that makes crops grow sterile seeds) (www.banterminator.org/The-Issues/Intr...). After questioning a woman from the Union of Concerned Scientists about if there was a reason he shouldn't eat his Monsanto-GMO potatoes, she replied, ""Why would you want to?"" He also visited a potato farmer in Idaho who grew conventional potatoes that retained so much pesticide residue that the farmer himself wouldn't eat them -- the farmer grew organic potatoes for himself and his family and sold the pesticide-painted potatoes to processors to become french fries and other fine things. Anyway, I learned about many things besides Monsanto... I learned a great deal about the history of human-crop interactions and how related human culture/society is with how our cultivated species change and spread throughout the world. "

The approach is interesting (4 crops, 4 symbolic meanings behind them), but the writing doesn't click for me; I'd prefer totally factual or completely personal. Pollan's writing lingers somewhere in the middle, but in a style that fails to rope me in. I hate to leave things unfinished, but this is due back at the library in 2 days and I can't renew it. So I'm skipping the chapter on potatoes. Maybe I'll come back to it someday. Probably not.5/7:I didn't care much for the chapters on apples and tulips, but the chapter on marijuana was pretty good. I think I preferred it because his language in this chapter was less flowery, pardon the pun. He stuck closer to the facts.4/25:Just started reading this. It's my first Pollan book and it's a slog so far. I wish journalistic non-fic writers would vary the formula and stop making books that read like very long magazine articles: an anecdote from the present; an anecdote from the past, leading into a laundry list of facts; end anecdote to past; return to present. Not saying this isn't a valid way to write nonfiction; just saying it gets old after a while. Also, Pollan takes a lot of liberties with his facts and speculates too much about what historical figures may have thought, felt, etc. Ditto for bees, apples... UPDATE: Also, holy tangents, Batman! This book is a skimmer."

The story of each plant highlights a different aspect of the relationship between people and plants, and how plants beguile us into being their ""bumblebees."" Each story also illustrates a botanical concept or two, a nice side-benefit if you weren't paying attention in science classes in school.I learned about centers of diversity (places where many varieties of a plant occur in nature, likely where the plant originated), and why growers resort to grafting to raise apples or grapes with the same taste. Also, how human desires shaped these plants - our desire for sweetness shaped the apple, our desire for beauty shaped the tulip, our desire for intoxication shaped marijuana, and our desire for control shaped the potato.Of particular interest and entertainment value is Pollan's habit of shifting perspective - from the human point of view to the plant's point of view, or to the point of view of a virus that impresses itself into the relationship between people and a given plant. Or, from the human perspective on the taste of an apple to the human perspective on social control or stabilization of food supplies. The complexity of our relationship with nature comes to the fore when I reflect back on the stories Pollan tells."

I confess this was one of those books I handed out as gifts based on reviews in the Economist and/or NPR and other sources. I think that in terms of content, it is a laudable book.However, the book is more larded with fluff than I expected. I did skim pages in which the author goes off in paroxysms of delight about plants and his garden. I am not a gardener, I think gardeners would be much more interested in his descriptions than I am.What makes the book worth reading is the information that he presents on the four species he covers, apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. His prose is quite readable, and this is not a bad book for fast readers to polish off on a lazy weekend. I will be clear, I am not arguing that Pollan should have a 'just the facts, ma'am' approach. Other authors have shown how to make non-fiction very readable.Simply put Pollan is not John McPhee, the master of literary non-fiction. It may be unfair of me to expect others to measure up to this standard, but I don't think so. I think that non-fiction must strive for a high level of readability. Despite my criticisms, I strongly urge anyone interested to read this book, the understanding gained is worth it, and the book is a worthy diversion."

Pollen walks through his garden with the eyes of plants themselves. His account of the co-evolution of humans and plants takes humans off the pedestal of their own self importance. All this time we thought we were engineering plants but when looked at from another point of view we are no different to the plants than the bumble bee, a servant in their service, working for the benefit of the most successful species. The book goes into detail about the history and science of four plants: the apple, the tulip, cannabis and the potato. What amazing stories he tells about each. Johnny Apple seed brings hard cider to the settlers, the tulip mania of the 1300's in Holland, pot growers in Amsterdam and genetically altered potatoes in the US. I very highly recommend this book. ""The cannaboids are molecules with the power to make romantics and transcendentalists of us all. By disabling our moment by moment memory, which is ever pulling us off the astounding frontier of the present and throwing us back into the mapped byways of the past, the cannaboids open a space for something nearer to direct experience.

The bee collects nectar and pollen to make honey and, in the process, spreads the flowers genes far and wide. In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires -- sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control -- with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind's most basic yearnings. And just as we've benefited from these plants, the plants have also benefited at least as much from their association with us. So who is really domesticating whom?~~back coverI was quite disappointed with this book. Usually I'm a big Michael Pollan fan, but I thought all four of these essays didn't really address his thesis that plants may have domesticat3ed humans in the same way that honeybees have evolved to be pollen carriers for fruits and vegetables. He did a great deal of research (and I didn't know that no apple seed is true to the parent fruit, did you?) on all his subjects, but then I thought glossed over the actual mechanics of how our domestication took place."

The EPA says the potato's safe and the chemical (Bt, in this case) are safe so they probs interact safe. Science disagrees, finding no basis for this and recognizing unforeseen combinations as possible. Pollan's conclusion - he didn't want to eat the GMOs he grew in his own yard or feed them to friends. Sure, he's eaten GMO taters at McDonald's and Frito Lay, but he couldn't do it himself on purpose and he understands why the corporations are against labeling. I believe there's misinformation on both sides of the argument, but I also believe the burden of proof lies on the people constructing the new ""food"" item.Apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes - all plants that have coevolved with us, giving us what we want and coming along for the ride as the human species affects the nature of which we are part. This book is well researched and beautiful. It is fair in its treatment of GMOs, I believe. My favorite part was the first section, on apples. I also enjoyed the mystical bits on cannabis - more than I thought I would. Biodiversity is good and monoculture is dangerous. The end."

The book is written in little blurbs, where after a page or two (or sometimes two paragraphs) there is a break. I don't think he developed the ideas enough to write coherently or to have conventional pages where ideas are related. It reads sort of like a journal; he often repeats himself and drones on and on about things without factual basis. The tulip chapter, in particular, was so void of facts and history (and anything of meaning) I have no idea why he included it. The introduction was so pretentious I couldn't read the whole thing. There is so much space filled with words with no meaning, repeats of sentences, boring stories. His attempts at philosophical thought hurt to read. Have you ever had a man (who doesn't fully understand a subject) interrupt you and present you with an obviously incorrect analysis (Aka mansplaining)? That's what most of his writing felt like. I appreciated the premise of presenting the scientific explanation of plants evolving with humans in lay peoples terms, but it was very condescending and had little new information about the thesis it claimed to hold (even to my limited mind that doesn't know much about these plants). I didn't learn much outside of some facts about Johnny Appleseeds life. Would not recommend."

These plants are the apple tree, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In four different essays,he defines our relationship with these plants in terms of how they fulfill a human desire: apples = sweetness, tulip = beauty, marijuana = intoxication, and potato = control. The stories of these plants are absolutely fascinating and include demythologizing the tale of Johnny Appleseed, how overspeculating in tulip bulbs caused the Dutch economy to crash in the mid-1600s, the history of man's use of psychoactive drugs, and recent genetic engineering in which potato genes have been spliced with those of a bacteria to create a plant naturally toxic to potato beetles and with, as yet, unknown consequences to humans and the environment. I swear you'll never look at a potato the same way again. I immediately started eating organically-grown fruits and vegetables after reading this part of the book.He merges historical and scientific knowledge, a journalistic method of inquiry, along with writing that often is quite poetic and full of humor.

Gonna put that one off for a while). This was one of his earlier bestsellers, and as a natural history book, it's great. The idea that our habits coevolved with plants as we 'domesticated'/pollinated them is an interesting one, for sure, and the four species presented have some historical heft to them. What soured me, unsurprisingly, is the the chapter on the potato as the embodiment of control. Meaning, most of this chapter is devoted to Monsanto's NewLeafs and the (negative) implications of GMOs. I realize this book is from 2001 but the trepidation around genetic engineering drives me nuts. While I agree that a biodiverse field will be healthier than a monoculture, I still think GMOs are the wrong villains to slay. If a modified organism reduces the expensive and toxic cocktail of pesticides used yearly, then why not use that technology? Why be a luddite? We get it; Monsanto is evil. But as long as Big Food and nationwide brands are a thing, we'll need to figure out how to approach monoculture in a more sustainable way. (I realize how oxymoronic that is but DEAL WITH IT)"

He writes without ever feeling dogmatic, yet is able to shed some harsh light on aspects of our relationship with nature and each other that we shouldn't ignore.The book is broken up into four different plants and an associated human desire that helped shape them; the apple:sweetness, the tulip: beauty, marijuana: intoxication, and the potato: control. Of course, none of these plants were truly shaped by one desire, and the part that other desires play in the history of these plants are what truly enamored me with his writing. It is immediately understandable why the apple is associated with our desire for sweetness, but it is finding out about it's history fulfilling our desire for intoxication, stability, or wealth that were less expected. The same follows for the other three plants. Even though control is the desire associated with the potato, it is obvious that the desire for control over nature (both human and plant) is a central theme in the whole book, as well as how this desire for control can lead to unexpected or even disastrous results."

Instead of reading like your usual dry essays on botany, this book is filled with the history of the absurd, the writer's own experiences in discovery of the history, and doesn't shy away from having fun. I would recommend this book even to those who don't have an appreciation for nature/horticulture/etc.I found this book absolutely delightful. True to a veteran writer, each sentence is a beautifully crafted work of art. That said, sometimes he takes his art a bit far, and the beauty of each sentence can get a little monotonous.Each section of the book, dedicated to a human desire and the plant that provides to each desire, is written with a different focus. The result is a series of individual tales, and I recommend reading it that way."

Based on the premise of the book, I was expecting him to expand upon some of the co-evolutionary theories that Jared Diamond touched on in Guns, Germs and Steel, and I think that Pollan started out thinking he would too. Unfortunately for him (and us), somehow he went awry.He divided the book into 4 parts - the tale of the apple, the tulip, the marijuana plant and the potato. I read the section on the apple, in which he tries to expand on the Johnny Appleseed legend, which was my first clue that maybe this book wasn't going to fulfill my expectations. But it was amusing nonetheless. In the tulip section, he begins to develop a casual, anecdotal, intellectual-at-a-fabulous-dinner-party tone which is condescending and annoying. I finally gave up in the marijuana section when I realized that he was using the book to tell his own little anecdotes and had completely given up the thesis of the book.I did hear from a friend that the potato section gets significantly better and lays the foundation for his next book, the Omnivore's Dilemma, but I never made it.

Pollan, with musical prose, focuses on the nature of our relationship with four plants: apples, tulips, marijuana, and the potato to make the point that we are engaged in a continuous dance of desire and reciprocation with other organisms, and that our alleged segregation from the natural world is the stuff of anthropocentric mythology and wishful thinking.

Pollan's use of four plants to discuss various aspects of the human experience--sweetness, beauty, consciousness alteration and the desire for control--absorbed and fascinated me, as Pollan's writing always does. I love Pollan's use of food and plants to explore history, investigate aspects of our culture and make a statement about the mass produced direction in which our food industry continues to move. Further, I am always appreciative of attempts to enhance our connection to our food, and the amazing workings of nature we often take for granted.The only reason why I am not giving this book 5 stars is because Pollan utilizes one of my pet peeves in his writing. It is particularly aggravating to me when evolution is anthropomorphized, with ""intent"" attributed to evolutionary forces. With science and evolution being as misunderstood as they are in American society, attributing aspiration towards an ideal ""end goal"" further serves to muddle evolutionary concepts."

So for me, the balance of this book was a bit off. It probably didn't help that I listened to the audio version of the book, so had a tendency to tune out the reader during long passages of poetic oration (as in the majority of the tulip and marijuana sections), then snap back to attention when the talk returned to science (as in the majority of the potato section). In spite of the sometimes overwhelming (for me) moments of poetic musing, the book is still a good read, using 4 specific varieties of plants (apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes) as a means to explore the relationship between plants and humans and how we have influenced each other.

The author covers four differnt ""topics""; tulips, marajuana, potatoes & apples. This history parts of each one was interesting, e.g. how the plants came to be domesticated, how they impacted some of the societies (tulip mania in Holland, potato famine in Ireland). Not sure it is as scientifically based as the flyleaf tries to make you believe. The potato section is the one that got to me the most. Not sure I can eat a french fry again without thinking about all the chemicals that go into making one! Of course as old as I am the damage has already been done so I refuse to worry. The least enjoyable section was the one on marajuana with his not so subtle opinion that it wasn't that harmful--whatever or making a case that we were dependent on it as a plant (only dependent on it if you choose to use it!) Nevertheless, it was kind of interesting, not in a wow kind of way more like a huh, I never knew that."

These are fascinating stories. From Johnny Appleseed, described as a protestant satyr or Swedeborgian Dionysus spreading the extremely heterozygous apples along the ever-expanding American frontier without, often, the benefit of shoes; to the tulip-mania from Turkey to Holland, to the benefits of forgetting; and finally to the sterile, except for potatoes, acres in Idaho that insure global McDonald's customers get long, golden fries sprouting from their red, cardboard containers. It was also neat to at least read about the remarkable variations available in some of the uniform products familiar in supermarkets.It's not often--first time really--that I post books I've read/am reading for school here, but this was particularly good. Besides, there's something very compelling about an author who, comfortably and compellingly, analyzes the genetic consequences of Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden."

Occasionally a bit lofty in it's attempt to connect the apple and flowers to God and supernatural but not entirely farfetched. Who knew that no two apple seeds would ever grow the same type of apple tree? Every one has a genetic mutation and variation. The ones we have now are all grafted from existing varietals to ensure consistency and not over saturate the market place with apple types. And Johnny Appleseed was basically an entrepeneur selling apples for hard cider on the wester edge of civilization (read: booze peddler).Giant seed conglomerates essentially have the potato farmers by the balls as you have to buy their seeds to ensure your crop will be desirable by big buyers (mcdonalds etc.). The can genetically engineer their crops to shut off after one season of growth so you have to pay to replant. Lots of good stuff in here...Look forward to reading more of his work"

When I read it before, I remembered liking it a lot and learning a lot, but the only thing that stuck with me was about the apples not growing true from seed and the pot plants growing behind the barn. Pollan's style is so easy to read and I enjoyed it again. Our discussion of it the other night was interesting, too, partly because I've moved to southern Idaho and several of the people in our group know the potato farmers that Pollan interviewed for that section of his book. I like the idea of looking at things from the plant's perspective, too. I've been thinking about that a lot as I've been perusing seed catalogs and planning what I will try to grow on my new homestead, which is a lot harsher environment than the one I just moved from; I've been thinking of things I can do to alter microclimates so that I can grow things that everyone keeps telling me I can't grow here, and now I'm thinking about how the cherries and apples and tomatoes are bending me to their will to create a place where they can thrive..."
225,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,4,"Revisiting this ten years after my initial reading was fascinating, especially the potato & marijuana sections. I recall thinking that Pollan sounded a little unhinged when he was talking about Monsanto's evil campaign to eradicate small farmers and the inherent dangers in various manipulations of seeds & genetics by Monsanto. Ten years on, he sounds prescient and perhaps a bit conservative. There's been a huge pendulum swing with weed- when Pollan wrote this, the US was in one of its crazed drug-prosecution moments, sending people to the Big House for minuscule amounts of marijuana. Now, I drive by 3 or 4 medical cannabis dispensaries every day. I wonder, too, about the relative potencies of different strains of marijuana and the selective breeding that Pollan discusses here- I've never pursued this info, though I suppose it's available.I love his tone which is not folksy but is certainly collegial and warm. Stellar writing, delightful subject. I would love to see an updated version of this one."

This book is structured very differently than Omnivore's Dilemma, in the fact that I didn't find it to be as thesis driven. While Pollan explores the relationship between human domestication and plant evolution, the book also consists of somewhat poetical musings regarding his personal relation with each of his four chosen plants. I liked this. While I liked Omnivore's Dilemma, it was difficult for me to sit down and read large chunks of. This book seemed to be a faster read. I liked how it was broken into non numbered short sections and that I could read a few pages at a time and come to a nice stopping point. As usual, I found Pollan's research into plants and our food system very intriguing. I enjoyed learning about the earliest known domestication of all four plants (apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes) and how human history has been shaped by each plant. If you are at all interested in botany, or human history, or our food system, read this book."

In addition to discussing artificial selection -- human propagation of, say, potato strains with favorable traits -- Michael Pollan also investigates domestication from what he terms ""a plant's eye view.""He does this by introducing the nominally controversial idea that certain species were domesticated because of their innate ability to satisfy our human desires. I say ""nominal"" because this is really just evolution and selection, which are key organizing principles in any self-respecting work of natural history. Stated simply, domestication allows a plant species to disperse, colonize more land than otherwise, and access other resources available only through man. But the strategy can also pose risks to the species too.This book has earned Pollan another fan. His writing is wonderfully clear and he makes plants interesting (I found myself often rewinding the audiobook to re-chew fascinating bits)."

His writing is good enough that it never gets in the way of his information and he manages to make books about plants and their history, really interesting. He has a great voice and one that never makes you think he's trying to convince or sway you. He comes across more like an investigative reporter and not like a foodie with an agenda. I have to admit that I liked Omnivore's Dilemma better but that doesn't mean this book isn't great!I learned so much about Apples and the American hero Johnny Appleseed (this book knocks him off his pedestal and makes him waaaay more interesting!) I didn't find the Tulip section as riveting but cannabis was illuminating. The Potato chapters were brilliant. Brilliant and frightening. I'll never eat a non-organic potato again! Then again, given that kind of information on any vegetable, I bet I'd think the same thing.So, read Omnivore's Dilemma and if you've already read that, read this!"

I suppose flowering plants are the king of exploiting animal desires and this shouldn't be very surprising. They even invented the first blow-up sex doll (well, for wasps). Pollan's account of the history of four successful plants, the apple, tulip, pot, and potato, was very interesting and even taught me something I didn't know like the real story of Johnny Appleseed and the political reasons for the proliferation of the potato monoculture in some European countries and not others. However, this wasn't a breezy read. SI found myself skipping most of Pollan's discussion about marijuana and stream of ""what is consciousness"" was ironically the least philosophical and interesting part of the book. I suppose a obsessed pothead or someone who is in the midst of questioning life might find it worth the time to entertain this chapter."
231,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204702-jennifer,4,"Loved this book, which traces the way that four plants (apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes) have evolved in various ways to meet human requirements. The chapter on tulips, with its consideration of the ideal of beauty, both the regular, geometrical beauty of a single-color tulip, and the unexpected, hedonistic beauty of a tulip that has the virus that turns it multicolored. The potato chapter, which is pretty persuasive on the dangers of monoculture agriculture (see Irish famine) and genetic engineering (see NewLeaf Potatoes actually classified as a pesticide, because they have an inserted gene for a bacteria that destroys certain kidns of beetles; monsanto started selling the potatoes to McDonalds without ever testing the effect on humans, so you've probably eaten one.)Beautifully written, thoughtful, able to reach very interesting philosophical points through the lens of four plants we all mostly take for granted."
232,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3667979-stephanie-h,4,"Although this could be considered MIchael Pollan's least accessible book (how many of us are gardeners?), Botany of Desire was an enjoyable read. Pollan looks at the history of 4 plans and how they have tamed humanity to their whims and desires. The apple has been cultivated for our desire for sweetness, the tulip for beauty, marijuana for intoxication and the potato plays into our desire for control. The chapters on marijuana and the potato were by far the most intriguing, probably due to the nature of their histories. Marijuana follows it's contentious past and present, and the potato chapter looks at the development of GMOs by Monsanto. The chapter on the tulip was the weakest chapter (because really, who gives a shit about tulips). In general, Pollan writes a very strong book that gives a strong opinion towards agricultural diversity. It may not be as easy a read as Omnivores Dilema, but it is still accessible in Pollan's true style."

I have always felt in collusion with nature when I'm in the garden, and this book accentuates that. In addition, after reading what major agribusinesses do to the genetic makeup of plants, I would like to preserve the natural world's method of genetic transformation, as much as I can, in my own little piece of heaven.The book is surprising in many of its details, especially in its account of Johnny Appleseed, and it makes perfect sense. Every time I go into my garden now, I feel a sense of obligation to the natural world. I'll be buying more of my seeds now, instead of plants that are at the end of the agribusiness production belt, and those from organic sources. I'm going to begin experimenting with heirloom varieties as well.I'm glad I read this book and I recommend it to everyone who needs to eat."
234,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456516-sophia,4,"Plants as subjects, humans as bees: The Botany of Desire is an interesting, thought-provoking look at the relationship of humans and plants. Michael Pollan focuses on four plants (apple, tulip, cannabis, and potato) and how they relate to the human desires of sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control, respectively. The PBS documentary of the same name focused more on the scientific aspects, perhaps because those were more visually appealing and less controversial. In book form, Pollan proceeds in a more reflective mode, for example discussing the Apollonian and Dionysian duality throughout. His intelligence, grasp of evolutionary biology and its implications, and love of gardening shine through. The idea that plants and humans co-evolve—that we humans may have done the evolutionary bidding of plants— gives The Botany of Desire paradigm-shifting potential by inviting the reader re-evaluate the proper role of humans in the natural order.

235,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen,4,"An enjoyable book which looks at the nexus between plants and people from the standpoint of four different plants and how they satisfy our ""desire."" The desire for sweetness: the apple; the desire for beauty: the tulip; the desire for into intoxication: marijuana and the desire for control: the potato. The story of the apple is the most satisfying to read, perhaps because the chapter can be built around the story of a specific individual: Johnny Appleseed. The story of the potato is the second most interesting, but the chapter on marijuana reveals the author's fondness for verbose philosophical wanderings and is therefore less effective. The chapter on the tulip talked much more about the author's own garden than on the Netherlands' tulipmania, which would have been been a more engrossing and appropriate subject. The chapter did inspire me to order a book fully about tulipmania. "

He is not good - not good at all - at forcing whimsy and philosophy as he takes you thorough a part memoir, part history lesson, part intellectual stroke session about crops and their influence on, and change as a result of the influence from, humans. I enjoyed the apple chapter, for what it was worth, and hoped the book would improve. By the time I got to flowers, the bullshitometer was all the way in the red, and I had to jump to cannabis. I finished the pot chapter but put the book down, shaking my head at the missed opportunity and boring arrogance of the entire book. You can tell this is one of his earliest works, but thankfully, he's learned - oh god I hope he's learned - that he's a much more effective writer when he deals with facts and the here-and-now, and less with historical intangibles."
237,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315015-laura,5,"I picked up The Botany of Desire at the library following txkimmers's recommendation. This is an incredibly cool set of four essays on plants and people: apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. Pollan does a great job turning around our usual view of ""domesticated"" plants. We usually see ourselves manipulating plants to serve our needs, making the plant just another tool. As he points out, plants aren't just hapless bystanders here. They have their own agenda, to reproduce!, and every plant that finds a way to get humans to help it along is using us, too.There's some great stories here. I had no idea Johnny Appleseed was such a character, and so totally different from the image that our grade-school books promote. The exploration of Monsanto's genetically engineered potato -- how they make them, how they're grown, why they're attractive to the US market -- was both creepy and cool. Do I really want to be eating these? And how will I even know?"
238,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,3,"Much of this book was quite interesting and informative. Pollan uses the history of four different plants -- apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes -- to illustrate how humans and plants coevolve together; that is, we are as dependent on the diversity of plants providing us with options to select from as plants are dependent on us to select, cultivate, and spread our favorite varieties. Pollan also provides a compelling case within each chapter for why monoculture -- limiting our preferences to a single species of a particular plant and then cloning it -- has disrupted this coevolution and how it is dangerous to both plants and humans. Unfortunately, I found too much of the book to be full of Pollan's own musings and numerous tangents, and the fact that he occasionally repeated his own phrases and metaphors grated on me. So the premise is good and you'll likely learn something from the book, but I found the execution left something to be desired."
239,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5488536-anna,4,"A part of me was worried I would struggle to fully enjoy this book not only because I had the audio format, but because I have never been terribly interested in plants. Thanks to Pollan's style though, my worries were unfounded. His storytelling made the plants themselves seem like historical figures one would have learned about in elementary school, rather than living things most of us take for granted. The history of the plants is weaved well with his own research in a way that feels like mini flashbacks throughout the chapters. Not jarring or random, so that you wonder if he just threw facts in here and there.The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars is at times it would begin to drag and lose my attention. I noticed this most in the chapter about the apple when he was speaking about Johnny ""Appleseed"". Perhaps I would have noticed it less if I had actually been reading the book rather than listening."
240,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29560882-dave,4,"Author Michael Pollan is a good story teller. And...his stories are important. In ""Botany of Desire"", he tells four stories about four plants and their historical interrelationship with us. As he explains in his introduction, he explores a different human 'desire' associated with each plant: sweetness with the apple, beauty with the tulip, intoxication with cannabis, and control with the potato. His unique and prosaic way of looking at the world makes the book a worthwhile and fairly quick read. And the points he makes in each of the four sections are important to us and our future. I won't go into detail (no spoilers), but will encourage you to read the book.Thin only drawbacks for me were two: Polan can get a bit repetitive at times (I get it, Michael, let's move on); and he occasionally gets a little too prosaic (where did you find that adjective?). But these are minor in the overall scope of his work. His points need continued consideration."

This book makes me yearn to buy a little place somewhere remote and try to grow all my own food. OK, most of my own food. I doubt I could grow coffee, cocoa or wheat, and I don't think I happily survive without those. But at least give it a try.The chapter on marijuana, of course, is interesting. The author speaks candidly about a topic that has been avoided in the mainstream, in the sense of logical analysis (politically, it's hot, which is perhaps why we don't get a lot of real science on it.).The chapter on tulips, that describes the boom and bust of the tulip craze in Holland, is fascinating to both science buffs and economists, while the one on the apple and Johnny Appleseed would appeal to anyone interested in history as well as plant breeding.Well written, surprising and fun, I would recommend this book to just about anyone."

I loved the theory that it presented that we forget things as a means of survival, ""for it is only by forgetting that we ever really drop the thread of time and approach the experience of living in the present moment, so elusive in ordinary hours."" Really cool way to think about things. It explained how we've evolved to help us endure and selectively forget things so that we can get up the next day and do it all over again. Went into how we spend too much of our energy living in the past - and by doin that we are standing in the way of our own enjoyment of life. It taught me a lot more about genetic engineering and that even as a vegetarian I am probably intaking all sorts of unhealthy chemicals. It was an interesting theory of how plants manipulate humans as a means of survival. It was a bit slow getting into it but finished strong!"

He takes four plants; the apple, tulip, cannabis, and potato and gives an in-depth history of each plant, how it has been shaped by humans and how the plants have shaped us. For to think that we are the master of nature is a foolish idea. The book is full of fascinating facts such as the successful entrepreneur Johnny Appleseed and the spread of Applejack (most of the apples grown from his trees were too sour to be eaten and were thus turned into cider), the Dutch tulip craze, the GMO New Leaf potato, and the successive increasing potency of cannabis plants. I recommend this to anybody who eats, this book is a wonderful journey of humans and their many connections to plants."

If you haven't read Pollan's ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" or ""In Defense of Food"", I would still start with those first, but if they've left you wanting more, this book is a welcome addition--full of the same smart, poetic prose that makes Pollan's books as much fun to read as they are educational. In this book he tells the story of four plants--apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes--to explain four basic human desires--sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control, respectively--and how those plants have changed us to improve their lives just as much as we think we've done to them. It's a clever point-of-view that he also brings up in his later books, but since this book is less grand and preachy in its aims, it's developed more fully and surrounded with more great storytelling."

The Introduction and subtitle ""A Plant's-Eye View of the World"" promised to be an intriguing premise. Alas, this book is anything but plant-o-centric. Pollan immediately gets sidetracked by the life of Johnny Appleseed and Apollo/Dionysus dichotomies in the human view of plants. He's a great storyteller and I was captivated by each of the four plants he profiles, but he always stays squarely on the human side of the analysis.Don't believe the book jacket; this isn't the story of four plants. It's actually four much smaller stories of of the people who obsessed over and altered the destinies of these four pivotal species: John Chapman, the 17th century Dutch, cannabis breeders and users, and Monsanto's genetic engineers."

This is really more like 4 booklets on particular plants that have interesting histories; the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. Each plant's story encompasses different aspects of culture - the apple chapter was a delightful insight into American history, whereas the potato chapter was a disconcerting view of how the business of agriculture is changing and how that will affect farmers' lives and what we put in our mouths. The tulip chapter focuses on the development of varieties and how it caused a market crash in Holland, and the marijuana chapter discusses reality vs. propaganda and how business influenced politics and why, without coming off as Hippie indoctrination - and while these 2 chapters were interesting, they didn't fascinate me - but the chapters on the apple and the potato were truly engrossing.

I also have a background of gardening and botanical illustration;my family background is Irish and not least, I'm an old stoner.

I love the way Pollan used the history of four different plants in human culture to give us a better understanding of our relationships with plants. Who would have guessed that you could spend a quarter of a book writing about potatoes and have it be so fascinating. Out of the four plants Pollan writes about: potatoes, apples, lilies, and marijuana; apples were definitely my favourite. But each one of these plants has an amazing history that Pollan managed to bring to life in this book. A must read for anyone wanting to give non-fiction a fair shot!"

The first chapter on Johnny Appleseed was brilliant and fascinating, but then the parts on flowers and marijuana spiraled into abstraction, getting far too philosophical on too little juice, and his miles of style started to become the substance. The potato chapter was also rendered pretty much moot by his next book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, which goes far beyond his nascent ruminations on food politics in this book. I guess I expected this book to be better than it actually was, frankly. Read the introduction and the first chapter and you'll be able to excel in any dinner party convo on this book."

Pollan's hypothesis that plants run their world and influence us just as much as we do them is fascinating. He chooses four types: apple for sweetness, tulips for beauty, marijuana for medicine, and the potato for control -- all four desires that humans crave and plants can fulfill. I'd never thought of plants in that way, since I'm no gardener and most plants die under my care. The apple chapter was my favorite, with Pollan's wonderful discussion of Johnny Appleseed and what he was really like, legends aside. All the talk of Apollo vs. Dionysus was, of course, right up my alley too."

The premise is simple: Look at the apple, tulip, marijuana and the potato and how those four plants interplay with humanity. Pollan uses all four plants to play off the tension of the Apollonian and the Dionysian conflict. This creates wonderful dichotomies such as human culture is necessary for the preservation of wilderness, the apple is the American grape and was originally all about the booze (gives a whole new meaning to those Apple Jacks I ate as a kid), the forbidden fruit in Eden as the first war on drugs, and the need for diversity in our plants.All in all it was a rollicking and enjoyable read filled with new insights."

The author focuses on the history of four different plants and how they have evolved to suit humans' desires for sweetness (apples), beauty (tulips), stability (potatoes), and intoxication (marijuana). It's written from the plants' perspective, as though they evolve certain traits that humans want so that they will be planted more and be sustained as a species.

Pollan is witty, thought-provoking, and creative in his research approach. It was a pure delight, and I missed reading it the minute I finished it.

His approach to the vagaries and quandaries of humans' relationships with plants was still very exploratory in this book and because it does not hone in on just food, as Omnivore's does, he plays with the writing and his tone a lot more. All the chapters were interesting but I found the apple history (with Johnny Appleseed prominently featured!) and biology fascinating and the potato chapter disturbing and thought-provoking with its discussion on Monsanto and their patented potato-genes. Highly recommend this book as a primer for Omnivore's Dilemma."

He has a great way with language, and each chapter made me want to eat/use/admire the plants (with the exception of the potato--that chapter made me never want to eat non-organic potatoes again). In all, it was a novel approach to domesticated plants, and how the plants may have had a hand in how they were domesticated (by tempting humans in one way or another). I never thought about it in that way before.I also want to plant a garden now, not to mention read his other books."

The most interesting thing that I learned was that when Johnny Appleseed (john chapman) was spreading seeds throughout america, Americans did not eat apples like we do today. They used the apples to make cider because American grapes weren't sweet enough to make wine. It wasn't until the temperance movement that people were encouraged to eat apples by sayings like ""an apple a day, keeps the doctor away."" Our grade school teachers lied to us!"

I could have done without all of the philosophical waxing on, not because it wasn't interesting, but because it really seemed like Pollan repeated himself... a lot. His Apollonian versus Dionysian ideas were very interesting, but it started to feel condescending after the fifteenth repetition. Of the four sections of the book (Apple, Tulip, Marijuana, Potato) I only felt that the tulip section was lacking in concrete substance - very little history (only a few pages on the Dutch tulip bubble) and too much of the philosophy. The other three sections were very engaging."
259,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042744-margot,1,"I would say this is Pollan's least interesting book and not really worth spending time on--unless you're really interested in the history of Johnny Appleseed or the tulip craze in Holland, or you are an aspiring marijuana farmer. Following the legacy of apples, tulips, cannabis (marijuana), and potatoes (specifically, the genetically modified new leaf potato) in four distinct chapters, The Botany of Desire contains some interesting botanical factoids buried within boring personal accounts and historical and sociological information that would have been more effective as sidebars rather than as the main content of the book."
260,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5704027-emily,4,"Having read (and turned pescetarian due to) The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food, I had high hopes for The Botany of Desire. In fact, I was rather expecting another book like Omnivore; obviously, I was soon disabused of that notion, and once I began to appreciate the book for what it was, I enjoyed it. No, it's not one of Pollan's more thought-provoking pieces; if that's what you want, then find a copy of Omnivore. Yes, it's a bit slow in the beginning, and Pollan's writing can be more than a bit repetitive, but I can easily overlook that to focus on the timeless, romantic stories he tells. "
261,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323097-karin-gastreich,5,"A book everyone should read. Pollan retells history from a plant's point of view, illuminating an intimate relationship in which we participate every day yet rarely consider in a conscientious fashion. He demonstrates how the ability of certain plants to satisfy basic human desires (sweetness, beauty, intoxication and control) has allowed them to transform us, and us to transform them. Pollan's prose is engaging and easy to read; making this one of those rare examples of a nonfiction book that I did not want to put down. It is a well-woven tale, vividly told; one that will change the way you see the world, and the path of human history within it.  "
262,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422340-betsy,5,"I have seen the PBS production of this book, and wondered whether I would be sufficiently interested to listen to the book in its entirety. Probably because I have a life long fascination with plants and with how the world has changed over time, this book was spellbinding for me. When Pollen described his delight in the sight of his garden in spring, and his experience of making his first garden at his parents home when he was growing up, I knew we had a lot in common. He brings such a bounty of threads into this discussion which centers primarily on four plants: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. There lots of food for thought and conversation here."
263,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6271452-tomas-lopez,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It explained the history of how theses 4 very distinct plant species to the eye are so closely related. It made me look at things from a different perspective. Humans aren't the only ones that are domesticating plants but plants themselves have evolved to show us desire of wanting to expand their existence, beauty, and efficiency through artificial selection. The examples that Pollen chose to show sweetness, beauty, intoxication and sustenance are very accurate for the reader to easily relate too. My only critic is the language he used ti express the connection between humankind and plants."

265,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28966455-maralgoo-ganbat,3,"I found “Botany of Desire” quite educating and entertaining at the same time. The book illustrates interesting insight into a plant world, as seen and written from plant’s eye-view. As Michael Pollan has cited, “All these plants, which I’d always regarded as the objects of my desire, were also, I realized, subjects, acting on me, getting me to do things for them they couldn’t do for themselves.” From the abundant examples and stories of apple, tulip, marijuana and potato, we can clearly see that plants also benefit significantly from human desires. This, I believe, is what Michael Pollan has referred to: Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection."
266,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Soft-spoken, but packs a punchPollan makes the rather striking point in the Introduction that we and our domesticated plants are involved in a coevolutionary relationship. We use them and they in turn use us. The bumblebee thinks that he is the ""subject in the garden and the bloom he's plundering for its drop of nectar"" is the object. ""But we know that this is just a failure of his imagination. The truth of the matter is that the flower has cleverly manipulated the bee into hauling its pollen from blossom to blossom."" (p. xiv)And so it is with us. There is no subject and no object. The grammar is all wrong. We plant and disperse the apple, thinking we act from our volition, yet from the apple's point of view, it has enticed us through its bribe of sweetness to further its propagation. It has played upon our desire. The same can be said of every other plant ""domesticated"" by humans. As Pollan points out, from a larger point of view our farms and gardens are just another part of the ""wild"" environment. And we, too, are part of that environment--increasingly a most significant part. The plants, and of course the cows, the ants, the roaches, the dogs and the cats, adjust to the environment, or they don't. The ones that do will flourish. Those that don't, the mighty oak, perhaps, the hard wood trees of equatorial jungles, the tigers and the condor, that cannot, will go the way of the dodo.This idea is not original with Pollan, of course, but nowhere have I seen it presented so convincingly. In a sense we are not the doer, we are the done. Pollan illustrates his thesis in four chapters on the apple, the tulip, cannabis, and the potato.The chapter on the apple concentrates on the life and career of John Chapman, AKA Johnny Appleseed, in which Pollan transforms the Disney-ish Christianized American folk hero into ""the American Dionysus."" The reason? The apple seeds that Chapman dispersed grew not into Red Delicious apples or Macintoshes but into scrawny little things, mostly too bitter to eat that were made into hard cider, which contained about three percent alcohol, the drink of default for the pioneers. They loved him for it, and occasionally there did indeed grow out of the cider orchards a tree or two that brought forth fruit that could be eaten with pleasure, and made into pies and butter.In the chapter on tulips and the tulip mania we learn that we are probably hard-wired to love flowers. Why? Because ""the presence of flowers...is a reliable predictor of future food."" (p. 68) We love what is good for us. We find beauty in that which nourishes. Pollan adds that ""recognizing and recalling flowers helps a forager get to the fruit [that is to come] first."" (p. 68) I might add that our love for little animals is both in their resemblance to our children and (hidden from our consciousness) their potential nutritional value in a time of famine. One might watch on PBS's Nature series to see how lovingly the big cat doth lick its prey.In the chapter on marijuana Pollan admits to growing the noxious weed in his garden among the potatoes and the tulips, but incurs paranoia since such horticulture is against the law. He points with restraint to the absurdity of the anti-marijuana laws, to the unconstitutional seizure of property by the marijuana police, etc., but one senses that he's pulling his punches. Or perhaps he feels that something is gained by using a quiet voice. He goes to Amsterdam and finds out just how potent the new marijuana has become. He views an indoor marijuana grow room and sees how sinsemilla is produced while noting that cannabis has become America's number one cash crop. (p. 130). He also notes that ""the rapid emergence of a domestic marijuana industry represents a triumph of protectionism"" (p. 131). Yes, Virginia, the drug war is artificially supporting the high price of marijuana and protecting domestic ""farmers"" from foreign competition.The final chapter on the potato has Pollan planting Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potato, a potato that produces its own insecticide as part of the potato itself by using a gene borrowed from a common bacterium found in the soil. Pollan weighs the significance of this while recalling the history of the potato from its origins in the Andes through its economic effect on Europe, and especially Ireland, to its status today. He comes out strongly against monoculture and in favor of biodiversity. He reports on Monsanto's infamous ""Terminator"" technology, genetic alteration of plants so that their seeds are sterile, requiring the farmer to become dependent upon Monsanto for seed, a technology that Monsanto ""has forsworn"" following ""an international barrage of criticism."" (p. 233)This a very pretty book written in an understated style about how we deceive ourselves, how we fail to see the world as it really is; how we see the world from a singular and restricted point of view, we as subject and actor, the rest of the environment as acted upon, when in truth, we are just part of the larger ecology, part of the process. We are creatures that kid ourselves to make more palpable our morally ambiguous behavior.My favorite insight of many in the book comes from page 247 where Pollan, in recalling the brilliant time-lapse photography from David Attenborough's PBS series, ""The Private Life of Plants,"" observes, ""...our sense of plants as passive objects is a failure of imagination, rooted in the fact that plants occupy what amounts to a different dimension."" --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
267,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"Spectacular nonfiction. The author had an idea: We think of ourselves as domesticators of plants, but maybe they actually domesticate us. The plants change into what we desire so we plant, care for, and protect them, and spread them to new territories.I couldn't understand why this is one of the most frequently banned books in schools . . . until I realized that about a quarter of the book is about marijuana.My only complaint is that Pollan (appropriate name!) always refers to farmers and gardeners as ""he."" Lots of farmers and probably a majority of gardeners are female."
268,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1661451-keeshi,4,"The Botany of Desire frames humanity through its historic relationship to four plants, the apple, tulip, cannabis, and potato. The case is made that we have co-evolved with these plants because they were positioned to take advantage of human desire. It is a history of their development in our context, but also the story of us in theirs. Rather than a tale of human conquest over nature, it is a humble and humorous exploration of the complexity of our desires and the evolutionary role they play in shaping the environment."

However, Pollan's anecdotal writing style combined with his passion for produce made this one interesting, thought provoking read. My favorite section was on the tulip - who knew that such a rather common, boring flower had such a rich history, complete with intrigue and scandal? And don't even get me started on the potato! Thanks, Pollan, for making me take another look at evolution through the eyes of a plant (potatoes have eyes, right?). "

I had no idea the toxic waste they use to grow them. I should be washing them with industrial strength soap before I even lift a finger to touch that starchy flesh. 2)Duuuddddeeee, Pollan is a paranoid pot smoking fiend who loves that miracle plant like a homeless man's trip to the local strip joint. 3)Johnny Appleseed was one weird dude who dressed in a potato sack.4)The Dutch are even weirder.

I already have an apple tree, but this spring I need to plant some poppies, such was the effect of this book. The point of the book is how plants trick us into doing things that benefit them, more than us. And now that it's almost spring and I'm watching my tulips come up who am I to argue. We move plants around, to give them broader range, save their seeds and bulbs year after year, carefully tend them removing nutrition draining weeds. "

There is also a documentary of this book on Netflix. Great writer, as many journalists are (horrible grammar on my part, huh?). He takes such a boring (in some people's opinion) topic such as the apple or potato and goes into the history and culture of these foods (also, the tulip and Mary Jane (!) ). If you haven't read Pollan's other books, this is a good taste of what's to come. But obviously, ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" is the one people talk about hte most."

Pollan delves into the complex biological history of each plant and the equally complex social history surrounding it, and his own experiences with them, through the interesting question: do we use plants or do plants use us? Pollan is a good journalist and succeeds in making a topic outside my usual interests engaging."

I picked up the book because of an amateur's interest in evolutionary biology; I thought a botanist's take on it could be enlightening, given that my reading to date has focused on animals and microbes. The information given is not without interest, but the combination of lyricism and sociology with hard science fact just did not work for me. Derive from either Darwin or Thoreau; the two don't mix."

I love the premise of the book: four plants which were influenced by humans, which also influenced us. History is a passion for me, and this is essentially a history book. The story is broken into four parts, focused on the history of apples, tulips, marijuana and potatoes. I didn't find the part on tulips very interesting, but the other three were riveting."
