0,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"If you want to criticise a book you can’t go too far wrong if you call it ‘reductionist’. As Steven Weinberg points out in his book,  Dreams of a Final Theory it is odd that people should think that reductionism is the perfect one word put down for a theory – given how incredibly successful reductionism has proven in Physics.My problem is when a theory that might work quite well at one level of explanation is expanded to include other levels of explanation that do not have the same necessity behind them.Take Natural Selection as a case in point. How do we get from single celled organisms to elephants? That is an interesting question and one that is more or less fully answered by natural selection. This is such an incredibly successful answer that only those with their fingers in their ears screaming out ‘I’m not listening’ are unable to avoid it. But its success can also be a problem too.Time for a random image. Imagine you are falling from a plane and you have a parachute which you are going to open when you are a safe distance above the ocean, but not too soon so you miss out on the fun fall. So, you are just going to pull the cord when the ocean is a safe distance under you – right? Well, no. The problem is that the ocean is a fractal – it is identical or rather looks identical on every scale. So, all the way down the ocean actually looks exactly as it does at every other height. It might look the same, but the difference between 10,000 feet and ten feet will become very much more apparent to you if you haven’t opened your parachute before one rather than the other. Not all scales are the same, not all theories work at all scales, even if they look pretty much the same to the casual observer.Dawkins’s book The Selfish Gene is one of those seminal books that many people have read and loved. I’ve read it, but didn’t really love it. Like Gould I had a problem with the idea that we are more or less machines fulfilling the wants and needs of our genes. Our genes are ‘replicators’ – things that want to make lots of copies of themselves – and we are forced by them to do stuff to make sure they get replicated. I can accept that this is partly true, although only partly, for as with Gould I don’t think genes are the right scale for an explanation of this kind. It is not genes that have sex, but organisms – and organisms are made up of many, many genes, not just one.At the very end of his book Dawkins comes up with the idea that culture seems to be spread in a way that is analogous to his idea of the spread of genes. The counterpart of the gene in culture is something he calls the meme (rhymes with dream). Blackmore takes this idea and goes a bit mad with it. She is a Buddhist, and that is important too, I think. I believe Buddhism is the religion of choice of many people who know nothing about it – you know, people who say things like, “Well, if I had to be religious I think I would be a Buddhist”. Personally, I would rather be a solipsist, but that might just be me. (Sorry, my attempt at subtle humour)Memes can be songs, ideas like e=mc2 or nursery rhymes. They are always things that get into your head and are hard to get back out again. Blackmore says there is only a certain amount of space in our heads, so there is competition for that space and successful memes are those that win out in the battle for that space. So, House is watched by millions, but some other show is not watched at all. Blackmore’s argument becomes an extreme version of Dawkins’s argument in The Selfish Gene. In the end she concludes that we are just a collection of memes, a memeplex, and our ‘self’ is an illusion created as much by these memes working together as anything else. This is pretty much straight Buddhism – 99% of everything we do is directed at the self, and there isn’t one. This negation of the self is seen by Blackmore as a liberation. I really like the idea of memes – I love it as a metaphor and I think it has much to say about how we live and learn in the world. But it is only a metaphor. Stretching it beyond this is pure (and not very helpful) reductionism. Culture is not Darwinian – you might be able to get it into that straight-jacket for a time, but force is what is needed to keep it there. Anyway, just because natural selection is wonderfully successful at explaining elephants is no reason why it should explain circuses. This is dull reductionism – not illuminating reductionism. As Searle says somewhere, if your theory makes you say something that is clearly silly, it might be time to look seriously at your theory. Saying ‘there is no self’ is a big statement – you are either going to have to really go out of your way to justify it, or really you shouldn’t be saying stuff like that in the first place.I really don’t think memetics will ever be a science of culture – but it will always be an interesting prism to glance through."
1,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,1,"There is an old maxim, ""The theory that explains everything explains nothing."" This sums up the problem with memetics as a ""science."" Whenever I see a memetic explanation for some phenomenon, it always seems to either be completely incorrect or simply repackaging a result already well-known within the social sciences in pseudo-biological jargon. The same applies to Susan Blackmore's The Meme Machine.Blackmore completely drops the meme-gene analogy, a smart move considering that it was untenable to begin with. Instead, she defines a meme as a ""unit of imitation"" or ""that which is copied."" But what, exactly, is this unit or ""meme""? It can be anything from the first few bars of Beethoven's Fifth to Gothic architecture, a triune god, and voting Democrat. Memes may also be found on paper, in brains, on television screens, etc. The definition is so loose that it may be bent to fit just about anything. This is, rather incredibly, only the beginning of the problems with memetics.By disclaiming the meme-gene analogy, Blackmore ends up painting herself into a corner by continuing to posit cultural evolution as a Darwinian (as opposed to say, Lamarckian) process. Without something like a ""functional ecology"" of memes or a field of ""population memetics,"" memetic ""fitness"" becomes difficult to define and more or less circular. Which memes are the fittest? The ones that spread the most! Why have they spread the most? Because they are the fittest!What Blackmore purports to ""explain"" with memes is, as above, often leads to unfalsifiable pseudo-explanations or a rewriting of earlier theories. Case-in-point: The evolution of the big brain. We really don't know how the big brain evolved, although certain hypotheses are more plausible than others. (Bipedalism as an explanation, for example, was refuted when the fossil record began to show that bipedalism evolved first.) The idea that the big brain evolved as a ""meme machine"" is patent hokum if meant in the sense that the brain literally evolved ""for"" spreading these non-existent entities called ""memes."" In the sense that the big brain evolved because of the advantages of imitation, then this idea is not new at all. It has much in common with the arguments put forth by, say, Michael Tomasello in The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition, who has, in addition, taken much more care in fashioning said arguments. Memes seem to add nothing to other models of cultural evolution as well, such as gene-culture co-evolution, which has done just fine without memetic theory.Speculation is frequently totally un-moored from reality, such as her assertions about the ""sexual selection"" of memes being supported by observations about love poems and songs. This is the kind of thing one might expect to hear from an alcohol-infused, early morning BS session among evolutionary theorists, but not in a published work purporting to be science.The book lapses into outright falsehood on the issue of the copying fidelity of memes. Natural selection really hinges on a certain degree of fidelity in copying genes, or memes, in this case, otherwise the process breaks down. There are two points where fidelity becomes a big issue: First in transmission and then in memory. Some amount of fidelity will generally be lost in transmission. (If only these memes could be transferred with perfect fidelity in the classroom, teachers would have much easier jobs!) Fidelity will also be lost in the process of remembering. As memory psychologists such as Elizabeth Loftus and Ulric Neisser, among many others, have demonstrated, memory is a reconstructive process. Memories are not stored like information on a hard disk, but rebuilt on recall. Scott Atran, in In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion, makes a thorough case in his chapter-length refutation of memetics that fidelity is not high enough for Darwinian-style evolution to hold true. The book as a whole also represents an excellent case study in how to study religion scientifically without recourse to memetics. Once again, memes add nothing. They, in fact, likely subtract by confusing the issue with a bunch of half-baked analogies and unnecessary jargon.Much of the book is written in a quasi-mystical tone. We are surrounded by these things called ""memes,"" constantly colonizing our minds and using them for their own nefarious purposes. The nature of memes, which are not limited by their medium or substrate but exist in some abstract sense, seems transcendental, smacking of a kind of Platonic idealism. This appears to be the end goal, really, as Blackmore argues for a ""Universal Darwinism."" Surely, Darwinian evolution applies to more than just biological phenomena -- anyone who's worked in the tech industry with evolutionary algorithms and anti-virus software can tell you that. But Blackmore's conception is just another grand theory of everything claiming to have resolved a whole host of heretofore major intractable problems in psychology and anthropology, explaining everything and nothing, and so making it more of the metaphysical than the physical sciences. I might have given memetics the benefit of the doubt years ago -- indeed, the idea seemed really attractive at first, as seems to have been the case even with many who were memetics proponents at some point. Perhaps it could have been described as a ""protoscience."" However, it has been a number of years since the memeticists pet journal (http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/) closed shop without producing any results. (http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/2005/vol9/ed...) I think it's fair to say that the entire enterprise has descended into pseudoscience. Reading the works of memeticists, I am often reminded of Freudian psychoanalysis in the sense that pretty metaphors are often substituted for empirical argumentation. And it doesn't surprise me that Blackmore abandoned one pseudoscience, parapsychology, for a newer and more fashionable one."
2,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60290-beaman,1,"OK, Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly about this book.The good:1. She does a good job of summarizing the body of literature on evolutionary models of the spread of information (i.e. other people's work). The relevant chapters, therefore, are a good introduction to the subject. 2. The chapter on alien abduction is sensitive, fair, and careful about its subject (those with the illusion that they were abducted by aliens).The bad:Every thing else, i.e. her own theories. Example. Her theory of why the human brain evolved to be so large: to make imitation possible--sexual selection of good imitators was involved. ""Scientific"" corroboration: people tend to fall for entertainers, who are good imitators. This is (to put it concisely) so bad!The ugly:The chapter on religion. Rigor is thrown out of the window, replaced with astounding naivety. She seems completely oblivious of the scholarly literature on religion (history of religion, philosophy of religion). Only if she had given religion the care she gives the phenomenon of belief in alien abductions!Two criticisms of ""Memetics"" in four paragraphs:(1) One problem with memetics is that it offers no valid *new* insights for historians. If memetics is about ideas evolving over time--documenting such evolution is bread and butter for historians. Ditto if memetics is about the fact that ideas (including ideologies/religions) survive and spread by adapting to social and historical circumstances. If the history of human culture and religion shows us anything, it is that each generation reimagines and reinterprets its ideological and cultural heritage, modifying that which, in some sense, no longer fits. If anything, Blackmore underestimates the extent to which humans reimagine and reshape their religious/cultural heritages. Ideas do evolve, but cultural evolution is Lamarckian, which is to say, human creativity is involved in the adoption and spread of ideas. Blackmore, by contrast, imagines human societies as passive, uncreative, and zombie-like. Societies helplessly pick up ideas just as they pick up viruses that make them bleed. History tells us otherwise; but Blackmore wouldn't know about that, because her work is not grounded in history: look at her bibliography and endnotes; it's meager on the subject of religion but rich on every other subject.(2) The memetic theory of religion can be tested against the data of history, just as Darwinism can be tested against fossils or genetics. While Darwinism passes the tests, memetics fails. Here is why. The memetic view is that some (harmful) religious practices and dogmas spread not because of any benefit they may have for the religious people, but only because they help with the spread of religion. For example, take celibacy for priests. It's hard on the priest, but benefits the religion, as it makes the priest divert all his energies to help the religion survive and spread. This is just like the fact that the genetic code of a virus is optimized to spread the virus, not benefit its hosts.Well, here is the problem. For the argument to make sense, we have to assume that the spread of these harmful ideas follows a Darwinian pattern (If we assumed it to be Lamarckian, as I argued before, then her whole argument would collapse). But if Darwinian selection led to celibacy, what that means is that as a matter of historical fact, there were other religions, or Christianities, lacking the celibacy requirement, and that this lack doomed them to extinction. We may now ask the historical question: Did mutant religions go extinct because they lacked celibate priests? The history of Christianity is well-documented, and the answer to this question is no. A similar argument can be made for the other ""harmful"" elements of religion she identifies."
3,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,4,"Despite its age (which becomes apparent only in a select few chapters that focus on the Internet and neuroscience), and despite that I disagree with a number of the author's contentions, I really enjoyed this book. Blackmore presents a comprehensive understanding of memes, those cultural self-replicators that drive much of our behaviour in our modern social world. She makes use of a host well-articulated descriptions, examples, and scientific narratives, offering fairly weighted arguments for most of the (many) topics she touches on, and explores the full extent of her theory as any rigorous scientist should. I was even appreciative to see a number of ""I have no idea""s and ""I'm not sure""s throughout; the honesty of a researcher who recognizes the need for further exploration shines infinities brighter, to me, than does the stark certainty of a popular science writer..... (that old adage that the more intelligent you are, the more you realize how little you know, applies)My primary complaint about the book was that it retraced its steps a lot, reiterating basic points and redrawing key analogies a number of times. I imagine this was to really drive the point home for those less familiar with biological evolution or memetic theory, which is entirely fair given the book's publication date. Still, I found myself skimming lightly over some of the middle sections, having deja vue moments and wondering when new ideas would be presented.A secondary complaint is at once more fundamental to the content of the book less critical to my enjoyment of it. And it's simply this: I'm not entirely convinced by some of the author's proposed extensions of memetic theory, which seem in spots to move the explanation back one rung without really hitting at the core ""why"" or ""how"" of the question. Meanwhile, she argues that this is the problem with using consciousness as an explanation for anything (and I agree whole-heartedly): it is an epiphenomenon that itself explains nothing, but instead demands further explanation. It's unfortunate that she didn't acknowledge the similar limitations of memetic theory in this respect, especially as it pertains to the chapter on ""self"" and the ""selfplex."" As a cognitive scientist deeply interested in the nature of memory, I don't think Blackmore steps back far enough to reach the core of the ""self"" issue. Regardless, the notion of memetic selection in this area has added an additional layer to my own theories of self (which rest, naturally, on a foundation of memory). I'm grateful to Blackmore for outlining these levels of analysis for me in such a thorough manner. It's certainly the task of any scientist to run with their pet theories as far as they can, and wait for evidence to contradict them; the contradictions serve as motivation to refine and move one step closer to ""truth,"" with the understanding that capital T truth is an illusion in science and that your ego is thereby best left at the door.And on that note, I want to underline how much I enjoyed the final chapter, which flirts much more closely with philosophy than the rest of the book. I love this way of thinking, without a self, and I want to practice it and see where it takes my thoughts; I feel it could have tremendous benefits for my work (or my memes, if you will... it's come full circle!) and my ability to think clearly about theory and computational modelling. As a prototypical grad student sufferer of impostor syndrome, it can only help my science to let go of such concerns and let the ideas drive themselves."

5,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,4,"Dawkins briefly introduced the term 'meme' in The Selfish Gene in 1976, principally to show that the process of natural selection was not dependent on a particular underlying 'technology' such as genes. Blackmore here expands on his thought, at the core of which is the recognition that the spread and persistence of an idea is not dependent solely on its utility: for instance, I have in my head advertising jingles from decades ago, possession of which never served my interest and has long since ceased to serve even the interests of the manufacturers. The ideas and behaviours which spread and persist are those which are good at doing so, and truth and usefulness are by no means the only factors determining that. A catchy tune or a memorable soundbite might suffuse our minds and our culture in spite of ourselves. (""I know a song that'll get on your nerves, get on your nerves, get on your nerves..."")(Interesting to note that some people think memetics is an empty idea, with no explanatory power. How then to explain its now widespread familiarity in our culture, if not by appealing to its ability to spread regardless of its usefulness..?)This book is generally regarded as 'giving memetics its best shot', as Dawkins puts it in his appreciative foreword. Blackmore argues carefully and cumulatively, her application of the memetic perspective growing more ambitious as she proceeds. She begins by teasing out an argument that skill at imitation is essentially unique to humans, providing an ecology in which 'imitable things' can perpetuate themselves, solely or in combination with others (in a 'memeplex'). The concept of the meme, under scrutiny, can be tricksy and elusive: Blackmore gives the example of learning from someone how to bake a cake: what is being copied? The cake, the behaviour, the recipe, spoken instructions, a neurological structure? She chooses to set aside the question, observing that copying and spreading of 'information' clearly does occur between humans (and storage media), which is enough to justify pursuing the ramifications. This step might be criticised, although it's worth noting that the term 'gene' is also subject to multiple definitions, which has not impeded or invalidated genetics.In due course Blackmore takes plausible stabs at the origins of language, the persistence of religions and even the notion of self-identity: the last chapter is especially thought-provoking, presenting a view of the mind cluttered with and constituted by competing memes (though she has some differences with Dennett's take on the matter). On creativity:Replicator power is the only design process we know of that can do the job, and it does it. We do not need conscious human selves messing about in there as well.Her tone is reasoned and reasonable, her style a model of clarity and accessibility. The insights she offers are sometimes counter-intuitive and slippery (particularly the unwelcome but increasingly common suspicion that we are passengers in our own minds), but that is not itself a counter-argument: the same could be said of quantum physics or tectonic plates. However, much of what she says is crying out for further practical research, which hopefully academia will take up (if it hasn't already - this was published in 1999).Some readers will disagree with her thesis (with or without justification), but I doubt anyone would regret having read it. Well worth your time."
6,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2845998-bryan-jacobson,2,"All of our brains for an environment where Memes (basically ideas) reproduce by being copied from person to person. Memes evolve and compete. Some dwindle (go out of fashion) some rapidly spread across the globe. This book is a solid introduction to Memes (which I believe are a useful way to think about human thought). I had high hopes based on a brilliant TED video by Susan Blackmore, but I enjoyed this book less than I expected.Early on the book makes many statements to counter arguments made by various critics of the theory of Memes. It seems overly defensive without actually countering the arguments very effectively (in my opinion). Also there are so many references to Meme explanations by Dawkins and Dennett that I almost wished I was reading one of their books.Later on Blackmore made various claims that (in my opinion) I felt might be true, but were not supported convincingly and explained well enough to be useful to me.For example, the whole idea of Memes rests on human's unique and powerful ability to pickup behavior through imitation. Blackmore talks a lot about our sense of ""self"" being a large ""memeplex"" (collection of mutually re-enforcing memes). How can I perceive (and hence ""imitate"") another person's sense of ""self""? I was unconvinced.I do agree with the author that many, perhaps nearly all, of our thought processes are built on the huge collection of memes we've picked up throughout our lives. I also agree with the idea that some memes can be harmful (for example those that result in group suicide or group celibacy). But, I believed in those before reading the book, and I felt like the book could have done more to illustrate them with powerful examples and follow through with the implications."
7,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,2,"The Meme Machine lays out the foundation for a new science... or at least it tries too. And fails.Blackmore is a wonderfully knowledgeable author, and the varied topics she dives in to while illustrating and describing her meme theory is one the reasons this book is still somewhat worthwhile.But as for her theory, it just is too hard to swallow. Somehow the replicator function of memes is crucial in order to distinguish them as evolutionary, but then it turns out to be impossible to consistently describe how memes are supposed to replicate. I mean, is a Beethoven symphony really ""imitated""? Maybe, but the multitude of ways her memes would have to be imitated really stretches that word beyond the breaking point.Meme is a very intriguing idea, and as a construct helps illuminate the whole viral marketing thing, and trends, and all that. But as a co-evolutionary factor which explains how we got big brains, not so interesting.Of course, this book is almost ten years old. Perhaps the ""science"" has flowered majestically and I'm just plain wrong. Or perhaps it has faded away after its ten minutes of trendy fame elapsed, I dunno. Probably somewhere in between, although I really don't think Blackmore's more extreme claims for memes have much merit."

10,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"Mixed thoughts on this. I think Ms. Blackmore has some good substance to her memetics theory, but there are points where she gets too fuzzy, and her explanations didn't convince me completely of its merits. She compares the replication of memes to that of genes, requiring fidelity, fecundity and longevity. I haven't bought off on their fecundity, much less the fidelity of memetic replication, but as this is not my field, I'll just keep thinking. It took me mulling over the whole when near the end to nail what should have been obvious to me earlier: she restricts her memetic theory to humans because, she contends, only humans can imitate. [As an aside, something like that is direly ripe for religious picking (to counter the dreaded evolutionary genetic theory). And I'm surprised it hasn't to my knowledge been picked.] I just read Frans de Waals' The Bonobo and the Atheist and I wonder if he would agree - I suspect not. I also think she imparts too large an impact to her theory: Evolutionary theory faced enormous opposition because it provided a view of humans that humans do not like. The same will probably be true of memetics.Not really. How is any of what is in this book something humans will not like? Moreover, how many people actually know anything about it? Or care? My observation above hints at no conflict with their religious thoughts on human evolution (or non-evolution.) By limiting such a theory to humans only, one shouldn't be comparing to genetics - genes are in every life in our tiny world, but memes are limited to one highly developed primate?"

This model allows us to see culture and behavior as living, evolving, complex systems of countless networked interacting units - a type of model familiar from evolution, cognitive neuroscience, and complexity science generally. One important insight provided by this new way of understanding cultural change is the realization that culture is not controlled by us and does not necessarily serve our interests in any way - and this includes our own behavior.

Firstly, obviously Susan Blackmore has done extensive research on the topics she tries to tackle with memetic theory. Moreover, I think that she does somewhat of a good job explaining the shortcomings of some of the sociobiological theories regarding brain size, sexual selection etc. There are certainly a lot of new information for those who are not biology-enthusiasts. However, what she fails to achieve is explaining what memes are. She lists the problems with memetics and promises to answer them but the promise is never fulfilled. That wouldn't be a problem if she would show the same understanding to some of the theories she bashes relentlessly. Even the basic question of ""what is a meme?"" is not answered clearly. Of course, memetics is relatively a new topic of interest, yet explaining scientific theories by using only metaphors defeats the purpose of understanding the true nature of the concept.

Research into the brain has evolved a lot since then, and on internet Facebook did not even exist, while nowadays it is becoming clear that computers will be able to reproduce/program themselves, that the human mind will not be necessary anymore.

In her book, we constantly read: 'It could be', 'I suppose', 'I think', and almost every four pages 'I would like that there was further research on this subject'. Lots of uncertainties. The big difference that Blackmore makes clear: the titel of Dawkins' book 'The selfish gene'. Blackmore explains very well that neither genes or memes are SELFISH. They do not have a goal. They can be repreduced, and that is what they do. But they do not exist in order to being reproduced. It just happens, which ones win depends on other elements, environment etc. And of course, the winners will spread more, be repeated more often, and win even more. But it is not their goal.Rather confusingDuring the first five or six chapters she explains what memes are. It is rather confusing, because there is also 'social learning' and other kinds of learning that imply imitation, and after having explained these differences, she talks about memes in the broad sense of the word. After all that I did not know very well anymore what she meant with the word and whether I could agree with wath she said. Also, in these chapters, she goes into all sorts of papers that other scientists have written on the subject, and explains why or why not she agrees with them. Sorry, but I am not interested by these purely scientists' affairs. On the contrary, it messes up with the explanations she makes, and adds confusion. Her explanations and theories would have remained clearer if she had not talked about all these other theories from other people. The book would have been shorter, also.Rather boringAfter having explained what memes are, the book becomes more and more practical. Blackmore explains how we see them at work in our society. Memes and sex. Memes and altriusm. Memes and religion. Memes of the New Age. The internet. But memes are what they are, and it is always the same system coming back. Once you know what memes are, you can also read an article on 'how to write a succesful book' or 'how to make a succesfull ad'. You will immediately know what are the memes in this story, how it all works, and why. You do not need 11 chapters with explanations on how they function in this and that subject. So here again: the book is too long.Some strange subjectsAlso, Blackmore can be rather blunt in her subjects. Homeopathy is pure placebo, our brain is so big because it is full of memes, animals have (almost) no memes... I do not care whether her theories are right or wrong, but we do not know, and she takes her suppositions for granted. Good book!With some imagination, once you know that memes are self-repeating processes in the brain that are transmitted to other brains, you can deduce most of the rest of the story yourself. Still, memes are a very interesting item. The understanding of the word meme is even necessary to understand the world.If you are interested in it, you can read her book, or Dawkins', or both. You will ceratinly learn from it. You will probably also sigh now and then because it is too long. I would advise to read diagonally from time to time. I give three stars, but I am sure that if I had read the book in 1999, when it was published, I would have given four stars. Because at that time memes were still very new to us, and the book would have been a revelation to me. Now it was not. And also because in 1999 the internet was not what it is today - I would have found her chapter on the internet very impressive, now not. Same thing for studies concerning the brain - I am missing some new findings in this book."
21,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,3,"There are two senses of the word “meme.” You might say there are two versions of the meme for “meme.” Probably most people know the term as lingo for an Internet theme. Cats are a persistent, practically deathless meme; it’s already been some years since an august researcher announced that “The Internet is made of cats.” Most memes on the net, though, are short-lived. Twerking was briefly a hot meme but is now—I hope—almost forgotten, like planking. There was a spell when fans of Mad Men madly posted pictures of themselves draping—posed like Don Draper in a chair; that, too, has faded.The Winter Games in Sochi are underway as I write, which reminds me that Olympic sports, a meme both on and off the net, are peculiar; most of the time, they lie dormant, seemingly dead, but every two years they rise and bloom, like an odd desert plant, before repeating the cycle. All these memes are basically something that everyone—within a particular group or culture—knows about. That’s one key to the broader and original sense of meme: a cultural parallel for the biological concept of a gene. A meme is something that gives rise to an element of culture as a gene gives rise to an element of a lifeform.Here’s another important part of the concept: a meme, like a gene, will be valuable to its carrier if it gives her something, confers some benefit. (This benefits the meme itself too; a meme has to be picked up and carried in order to have much hope of spreading.) Thus Christianity promises to bestow on its believers a life after death; very cunningly, it also declares that nonbelievers will perish to everlasting torment. It promises also to be true—not only that but to offer the one supreme truth. To some extent, this truth-promise is held out by scientific ideas as well. Einstein’s theory of relativity claimed incidentally to provide a new and more comprehensive truth about the universe. The essential difference is that a scientific idea presents itself as part of a larger set of memes—those of science as a whole—which include the means of testing the truth of any proposition. Thus relativity’s claim of truth necessarily entailed the further claim “Test me and you’ll see.” Neither Christianity nor any other metaphysical religion claims to be verifiable in the sphere within which it operates, that is, in the world in which we presently live, or rather they claim to operate in something greater than the material world. In any case, you have to buy into it and die before you find out. No one is likely to doubt which approach I favor, but my point is only that, as memes, religion and science offer different kinds of benefits.The idea of a meme, as I suggested in my opening, is itself a meme. The benefit it confers is its interpretive power. It gives us a new and more comprehensive way of understanding elements of human culture. In doing this, it proposes to solve a problem. Broadly speaking, we have genetics and evolution to assess the nature part of human existence. What covers the nurture part? Memetics, the study of memes, can in principle address all of that.My recent interest in memes and memetics—I’ve known of the concept since the 70s—arose when I was researching suicide, which I realized can be viewed as a meme. I read Susan Blackmore’s book to see whether and how it helped. It sharpened and strengthened some of my thoughts, though I don’t at this point recall whether it gave me any new ones. That’s not surprising.Blackmore’s book is meant to introduce and explore the science of memetics for a general audience. She pursues a variety of specific subjects from the memetic standpoint. Richard Dawkins lists some in his foreword: “Why do we talk so much? Why can’t we stop thinking? Why do silly tunes buzz round our heads and torment us into insomnia?” There are more. Suicide just doesn’t happen to be among them. Blackmore investigates a few relatively uncommon topics as well, such as consciousness and free will.Blackmore’s exploration is thorough, well developed, and carefully argued. Anyone who’s interested in ideas large and small may find it exciting; I did. Obviously, I haven’t tried to describe it here, and so I won’t address possible criticisms; you can find those elsewhere. Instead I’ve sketched a short introduction to memes themselves. If the concept interests you, I suggest you read Blackmore’s admirable book."
22,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"In fact, it is you if Blackmore's ideas reflect reality, as the self is a very questionable and slippery thing, probably illusory, whereas the continual chatter that goes on in most of our heads must consist of a soup of parasitic replicators that sneak in via televisions and newspapers and hijack our neural circuitry to force us to make more televisions and newspapers.I had a bit of an internal fight over how to rate this book, at one point thinking it would merit a neutral three stars. By the time I had finished, Blackmore had swayed me. I am not claiming to be a convert, but some of the ideas are so compelling that I think they really have a chance. There were also a couple of ancillary thoughts so arresting that I laughed out loud at the sudden switch of perspective. Try this for size: ""Pyper concludes that 'Dawkins himself has become a survival machine for the Bible, a meme nest for its dispersed memes that may induce readers who would otherwise leave their Bibles unread to go back to the text.'"" Now that's a nasty-sounding case of parasitism arising among memes!Blackmore speaks of the sudden and unique explosion of human brain size and culture in terms of a co-evolutionary feedback loop driven by memes. This sounds very plausible to me, but I was left a bit short of a concept of how to test it. Human brain size certainly seems to need a special explanation. Large brains are energy-expensive and dangerous in childbirth and take an outrageously long childhood to fill up. Lions and wolves and Velociraptors got along fine for aeons with more modest kit. So why the exception in our case? Memes seem like a plausible trigger, once a threshold is passed where they can replicate.Blackmore devotes some space to religion, and here again she seems to be onto something. She reports that near-death experiences tend to be very similar in all cultures where they have been reported - and of course that there has never been a case of a person meeting a deity from another religion of whom he had not heard prior to the event. Ever. If you meet St. Peter, then you came from a culture that had a Saint Peter. It's all in your head. Or rather, since the advent of human culture, it's in the meme pool and on the pages of ""holy"" books and just happens to be parasitising your head because it has proven effective at making you proselytise. Religions are, on this view, a particularly virulent infective memeplex with unusual power for making people record them and pass them on.I was left a bit unsure as to whether memes defeat the problem, known since Darwin and later found to be irrelevant with the discovery of DNA, of blending inheritance, for instance by being digital and thus capable of Mendelian-style recombination rather than progressive dilution. On the other hand, they definitely seem to be evolving to reproduce with fecundity, fidelity and longevity, as Dawkins suggested that replicators must do. The internet has led to an explosion of informational fecundity in the form of mails, spam and viruses. ""Time-capsules"" and ancient palimpsests demonstrate longevity, the memetic equivalent of the tardigrade tun. Fidelity in an age of print and digital copying is near perfection. If this is a metaphor, it is a compelling one.At the end of the day, and the book, I am not sure whether memes really provide a strong theoretical basis for new understanding. The idea, however, is charming and persuasive. Blackmore leaves us with a thought as to how to improve our own lives, mostly trapped in the thicket of the tangled memory bank of the memes and deafened by the hum of memetic competition for our mental processing time: Just be. Quietly watch the mind and achieve what we karate folk call ""zanshin"" - quiet awareness. We have increasingly become the slaves of this infernal mental noise, whether it is a set of independent informational parasites or just too much media dross. We could use some inner quiet, and Blackmore reminds us of that. Serve your own peace; not the selfish replicators. "
23,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33177343-david-l-pez,4,"Plenty of ideas about the world of memes and their implications. Good points: -Defining memeplexes as groups of memes that coexist and that determine the environment in which certain memes would succeed while others fail - Showing that imitation is a learning model that very few animals have and that could have notorious advantages for the spread of both memes and genes. - Making a case that memes act for their own selfish interest. - Her division of ""copying the product"" and ""copying the instructions"" is pretty simple but particularly useful, specially in today's world where the computers store the instructions to re-generate the ""product""(images, songs, writings) in different media(screens, speakers, VR headsets, printed sheets) - Some clever examples of meme strategies that would explain why some memes prevail today and not others. - Defying the conception of self and Dawkins idea that ""we"" should reveal against our memes, while our memes are pare of what make us who we are. - An introduction to communications from the memetics perspective.On the other hand, she overreaches with her theory trough the whole book and misses some important references to other works that would made her concepts more consistent and clear, so I'd recommend that this should be read from a critical point of view."
24,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"We, human beings, are products of our environment. This sounds like something a Marxist-inspired social scientist would say. But in this book Susan Blackmore argues for the same case, but probably will find these same social scientists (and all political correct thinkers with them) in her way. The main thesis of this book is as follows.Human beings, like all animals, plants, funci, bacteria and protozoa on this planet, are products of biological evolution. Our 'design' comes from the algorithmic processes of nature. Unlike the rest of nature, we seem to have culture; this begs for an explanation: if culture is such a 'Good Trick' then why don't we see other organisms having the same thing?Blackmore argues that what distinguishes us from the rest of nature is our ability to imitate. We observe other people doing things, put ourselves in the (mental) shoes of these other people and then do these things ourselves. This sounds simple, but it really isn't - the only thing in nature coming close is birdsong.Imitation leads inevitably to the existence of pieces of information - memes. Considering there's a finite amount of minds, time, energy, etc. (i.e. genetic constraints), the memes will compete with each other fro our attention and imitation. This leads, by definition, to memetic selection: some memes will fare better than others. Blackmore zooms in on this last issue and builds up a whole new edifice of a new science of memetics on this central issue. What memes are more succesful than others? And more importantly, why? In summary: whenever an entity that makes copies of itself (i.e. a replicator) originates, with the three key ingredients high copying-fidelity, high fecundity and longevity, a process of selection starts. This unguided algorithmic process leads to the appearance of design. Pieces of information are such replicators, competing for our minds. So after discovering the gene, we have dsicovered a second replicator: the meme. Natural and memetic selection have shaped us and are still shaping us.In the first third of this book, Blackmore explains her main thesis in easy-to-follow arguments and makes a strong case for the existence of memes and their impact on our lifes. She overstretches her hand a bit when she postulates memes as the origin (cause?) of our large brains and our innate language module. There's still much unknown about the origin of the growth of our brains and the origin of language. To be fair, Blackmore deals with all the possible theories on these two topics and only then offers her own explanation.The second third of the book , Blackmore shows the power of the theory of memes: she applies her theory to such topics as sex, altruism, New Age phenomena (UFO's, near death experiences, fortune telling, homeopathy, etc.) and religions. In all these cases memetics explains the phenomena better than the rival theories - according to Blackmore. Why do New Age phenomena persist? Because the memes making up these phenomena play on our genetic needs (e.g. the need for understanding/the need for explaining unknown but impressive events). Why do religions exist? Because of our natural reverence for powerful males, high in the hierarchy - so the Catholic God is a sky-daddy (in the words of Richard Dawkins). Why does altruism exist? Sociobiological explanations are good, but - according to Blackmore - do not tell the whole story: we have a innate (i.e. genetic) need to be liked by others. Memes that make you more likeable thrive; you look for mates who are more likeable imitators; memes start ""to infect us with altruism"". Memetic selection even explains why we (in modern societies) give up the notion of 'sex to reproduce' and use contraceptives en masse. Memes of 'sex for fun' play on our (genetic) drive to enjoy sex, thereby spreading themselves. The third part consists of an exposition on the internet - the memes' way of seeking a mechanism that leads to higher fidelity, high longevity and higher fecundity in copying themselves. (I saw a recent Ted-talk by Blackmore and she seems to have updated this part of her book with a new (third) replicator: genes, memes and temes.) She closes the book with a dismantling of our illusion of consciousness: the 'self' is itself a complex of memes - a selfplex. There is no single center of consciousness in our brains (Dennett's Cartesian Theatre) and there is no such thing as free will. There is only natural and memetic selection battling it out with eachother with our minds as the primary battleground. This is certainly an interesting notion, something that connects with my own thoughts on consciousness and free will, so I guess this new meme fits neatly in my current memeplex...This is all interesting, but is it true? Blackmore proposes this book as the foundation of a new science of memetics. A scientific theory should at least lead to (1) testable predictions that make it possible to refute (parts of) the theory and should lead to (2) a new understanding of existing or not-yet-known phenomena (in other words: it should explain something better than existing theories). Throughout the book Blackmore derives testable hypotheses of her main theory, so I guess she accomplishes the first part of building a scientific theory. (One could argue about the specificity of her predictions; they need a lot more fine-tuning to be specific and refutable, but let's grant her this point, it's a start). Blackmore takes up the second problem of a scientific theory with fervor and class: throughout the book she favors evolutionary psychological or sociobiological explanations, but in all these claims these theories (of explaining human behaviour in light of evolution) are not complete enough. She does this to make some room for her own theory, which in itself is a strong case of good science.If one judges this book on the author's own terms (offering a scientific theory of culture in terms of memes), one can only congratulate Blackmore on the attempt. It's amazing how she is able to build an edifice of a whole new building and how she's able to tell the story in an interesting and comprehensible style. A superb book that offers profound and far-reaching insights!On a side note: She cites E.O. Wilson as claiming that 'genes have culture on a leash'. As far as I can see (which is not far, in any case), Wilson is right in saying this. What he meant is (I guess) that culture has a maximum variability, and this variability is directly related to our genes. So considering the human being as he/she is, it's (nearly) impossible to find or 'create' a culture that is built on, for instance, complete egalitarianism, celibacy or starvation. This is simply impossible, considering who we are (our genetic ancestry). Blackmore claims that memes can make us do things contra our nature: the celibate priest or our use of contraceptives are her most vivid and strongest examples. But celibacy is a very dubious concept; there's a lot of evidence that so called celibate priests were either suffering a lot (confirming Wilson's statement of the genetic leash) or where simply not celibate and having illegal children with married women (confirming Wilson's statement of the genetic leash). The same with contraceptives: even though in our Western culture the use of contraceptives has skyrocketed in just 50 years, children are still being born by the dozens (confirming Wilson's statement of the genetic leash). The growth has been checked, but ceasing with sexual reproduction is, for all practical purposes, simply impossible. I guess Wilsons insight is meant as describing the (human) playing field that memes can use for their own reproduction. (Keeping in mind that his language is metaphorical, ofcourse)."
25,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,When an idea suddenly occurs to you，you want to enrich it by more evidence support.;the birth of memetic theory is an accidental attempt to explain the mind evolution. personally I keep my mind open and pleased to stumble upon an idea that might be a parallel explanation of cultural evolution with biological evolution. There could be more than one theory that might or at least try to interpret the idea replication and transmission or the very existence of consciousness. The world is complex and open enough to embrace diverse ideas and different theories to interpret things we already know or those not. If I see the genetic evolution is biology-based，then memetic selection is mind-based that attempted to offer a perspective to penetrate into the mind evolution and try to shed some light on it. I think ideas are both dangerous and serendipitous. I'd reserve any judgement before I delve into it a little bit more. An enjoyable read anyway though I suppose the author has over-expanded her theory trying to cover every facet of this mind thing.
26,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15244149-david,4,"This book was an astonishing surprise! I picked this up when I noticed that the definition I was using for the word ""meme"" differed from what folks on Facebook seemed to be using. I did some research, this book caught my eye, and I thought it would be a good read to deepen and solidify my understanding of the meme hypothesis, and that it did. Dr. Blackmore is an intense believer in the meme hypothesis, an hypothesis treated with some skepticism in the academic world. But where the book takes a surprising and even weird turn is when she uses the meme hypothesis to argue that there is no such thing as self and further, to recommend a meditative practice for freeing oneself from that meme-induced illusion, to go through life letting decisions and actions just flow. I am reminded of the character of Professor Frost in C.S. Lewis's ""That Hideous Strength"" who engaged in a similar exercise only to find that having so freed himself, his actions were controlled by minions of Satan who ultimately lead him to his destruction. I suggest this only as a literary parallel, I have no idea what Dr. Blackmore will accomplish with her meditations except that I am pretty sure it will not be demonic possession. In the end, this book is a delightful read, whether it be fact or fiction, and I would recommend it to anyone."

35,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11319054-andrew-yerkes,5,"This book is a fascinating, well-written discussion of memetics that is grounded in scientific theories that the author clearly introduces and builds upon. Blackmore is arguing that memes are a 2nd replicator, doing in the cultural realm what genes do in terms of biology. Just as there is no consensus between scientific fields about what exactly defines a gene, so too does the concept of meme have some imprecision, as Blackmore admits. The term can refer to a concept in the mind, a PDF copy of a novel, a melody, a recipe, or a social theory, among other things. In short, a meme is any copyable instruction that can be passed from one mind to another. The appeal of memetics as discussed by Blackmore and others is that it allows us to understand cultural change with a model that does not rely on the idea of individual genius or widespread comprehension of an idea, instead showing how an idea can spread based on its ability to lodge itself in people’s minds for any number of reasons related to our biases and intuitions. So for example, religions that rely on faith over reason very effectively insulate themselves, as memes, from competing memes based in reason that might displace religious faith, because they insist that faith must take priority over untrustworthy reason. Seeing cultural evolution through a meme’s eye view, to use Blackmore’s phrase, foregrounds how little truth has to do with widely held ideas.Given the threat that this theory poses to people of religious faith, as well as humanities intellectuals unwelcoming of a scientific theory that seems to threaten pre-existing disciplines, it’s no surprise that the most liked reviews here are negative hatchet jobs full of ad hominem dismissals and mischaracterizations of Blackmore’s argument, claiming for instance that her book argues that everything is a meme, a misreading that she anticipates and tries to correct for in a section entitled “Not Everything Is a Meme.”A more credible critique of the book is that it treats memetics as a science, when in fact it is a metaphor. As a nonscientist, and someone who finds memes very useful to reconsider literary history, especially for the analysis of why a given work became prominent, I have no problem using the concept metaphorically, and don’t really understand why Blackmore and others insist that it is not mere metaphor. I would appreciate reading a more measured critique of the book from a scientific perspective, instead of the sloppy dismissiveness of people who don’t like the book.As far as I’m concerned, it is an excellent and useful introduction not only to memetics but to debates and topics in evolutionary psychology."
36,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"I had a friend other day say he wished he could find a book that would blow his mind the way Dawkins' Selfish Gene did. This title was my suggestion. As Dawkins discusses in his intro to this book, he invented the term meme but had no idea how far people would run with it and how sticky this concept would become. I found the meme chapter of the Selfish Gene incredibly compelling and have had ideas in the direction Blackmore goes rolling around in my head for years. I searched for 'meme' in the personal notes on my phone and the list seems endless including some laughable gems like ""The Purpose of Life and How Memes work"" and ""we are built to transmit lies."" Being curious enough to wonder, but lazy enough never to really look into it, I kept wondering why no one had written ""the selfish meme."" Well I finally stumbled on to it.The core idea here is that while humans are genetic animals spreading genes (DNA based replicators), human evolution also created a new platform for replication, the meme, or transmittable idea. Just as the innovation of simple replicating DNA combinations led to an unfathomable biodiversity, so memetic replication, perhaps initially just used to spread tool making (and to value the good makers as much as the good looking), has led to every permutation of culture and creativity in the human pantheon.Blackmore's exposition feels patient and thoughtful as she proposes basically a new academic field of study and various kinds of studies that might be used to validate or invalidate her claims, and I'm not gonna lie, I started poking around for Ph.D. programs in this direction, but I haven't found any yet.At the end of the book she muses a bit on what this kind of insight has meant to her in her life. Contrasting her approach with Buddhism and some other philosophies (though I'm not sure that's really warranted) she talks about letting the memes drive her a little more and letting her intention step out of the way. This insight I've found pretty helpful."
37,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50113398-shane,5,"Blackmore's book is a very complete, well argued and engaging exploration of the meme and the consequences of treating the 'second replicator' as the locus of cultural evolution.I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in exploring the potential mechanisms behind human culture and society.Although I highly recommend this book, my one criticism is that Blackmore does not seem to be too worried about actually physically identifying the nature of a meme. Given the author's frequent use of comparisons between genes and memes, I feel, this is somewhat of a gap in the logic of her thesis. I say this because the genetic revolution did not, of course, begin until after Crick and Watson confirmed DNA was the molecule of inheritance in 1953. Not to mention that the mechanics of Darwin's theory, which was originally published almost a century before was only finally given a fundamental explanation after it was shown to be expressed through the physical conduit of biological information, the nucleic acid.That said, Blackmore does paint a persuasive picture, and as she often suggests it is up to molecular biologists, neuroscientists and others, to test her ideas and perhaps uncover the physical structure of the meme."
38,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31833834-alexander-smith,3,"This book takes Richard Dawkins' somewhat brief description of memetics to its logical/scientific theoretic ends within a biological framework. To a large extent this book would make sense with older biological theories of neo-Darwinian evolution, but this is not accurate anymore. The Selfish Gene, while influential and important as an idea in genetic theory, is not empirically supported. Genes are ecologies. Thus if the memetic theory still holds, so are memes.Ultimately, this means that memes for Blackmore are not quite as analogous and causal as she assumed. Also, it means that she perhaps got a lot of things right, but with the wrong rhetorical focus. She admits memes are just communicative practices within the first 75 pages, but continues formulating them to be in line with outdated biology. For this theory to survive, she would have done better to start with Information and Communication, and argued out a critical perspective of biology instead of the other way around. It seems, although that subverts the scientific dominance of biological forces and Dawkins, it would have made her theory more accurate to biology today."
39,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"This had some interesting thoughts, but I felt like Blackmore never quite defined what a meme was in her usage, and her apology for not quite defining it was not quite satisfactory. She also didn't clearly show how memes are truly independent of genes, because I don't think they are, and a lot of what she ascribed to memes could just be complex neurology and biology dependent on genes. If memes are a new separate replicator, how are they different from, say, human bodies, which also replicate? Biologists would say that genes make human bodies in order to make more genes, but Blackmore didn't clearly demonstrate why memes aren't also the creation of genes for making more genes.I appreciated her discussion at the end about Self. It's an important discussion, and I think she's on the right track. I'm not sure I love her conclusion about how to live in light of the absence of self, but she's probably logically consistent there. If there's no self and no suffering, there's no enjoying. Ergo, nihilism. Food for thought."

This book is my first experience (and I think the first in general) introduction to the study of memetics or the idea that you are a collection of memes (aka cultural units) inherited and translated from everyone and everything around you.

55,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19256190-todd-allen,4,"Richard Dawkins, in his book the Selfish Gene, provided a springboard—the idea of a meme—from which Susan Blackmore in her book expands upon and uses to better explain social phenomena that are otherwise seemingly intractable. Other biological curiosities unique only to humans—up to this point, as far as we know—are also expanded upon in this book and examined from a meme’s perspective. Like genes, memes have no modus operandi other than their own duplication. That their duplication is not error-free is the key component of the process that has led to the varied wonders and tragedies of the collective human experience. There is no ghost in the machine, no intentionality, no unseen being in control, directing the memes to their most ‘useful’ form. Human constructs, however much cherished, are nothing more than memeplexes cohabitating and/ or battling-it-out in an environment which contains the key ingredients required for their continued existence.I found the author’s thesis to be a palatable explanation of the variety of phenomena that have resulted from the evolution of the human mind. By applying the idea of Universal Darwinism, where the common denominators across replicating devices are fidelity, fecundity and longevity, she is able to provide a framework from a meme’s mechanistic point of view, which, like a gene’s, is based on its ability to copy itself multiple times with imperfect copies being selected for in the ever-changing contexts in which it and its predecessors came to be. Alas, it seems the ‘meme-craze’ has subsided, based on my inability to find anything current on the topic. My limited research indicated that Susan Blackmore has moved on to other endeavors unassociated with further development of the meme hypothesis."
56,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"Blackmore talks about memes. This term, that is, the ""meme"" was first coined by Richard Dawkins (in ""The Selfish Gene"" which was also a good read). It is basically any idea or behavior that can be transferred from one organism to another by imitation. Much like a gene, a meme has the properties of fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is this replicator medium that allowed for the cultural tranformation of our species. Blackmore goes into depth asserting that our minds are best understood in terms of memetic selection -- that is, a second form of natural selection. We can think of memetic selection as a second level of complexity originating from it's predecessor, the gene. Certainly the advent of human language, and most notably written language, caused a catalyst for memes to improve in terms of their fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is a great explanation for why certain religions stand the test of time as well; a combination of memes and writing systems. For example, religions that preach to others to spread the religion, to write it down, and to make it one that will reward those that follow it and punish those that don't -- it is no surprise that the especially superstitious and gullible masses of the general population in the past would be drawn to these religions, and after the myths and legends change over time (and the theology that accompanies it), we are left with believers til' this day. The meme is a powerful entity and certainly one that deserves careful investigation when discussing various topics including but not limited to: human evolution, cultural evolution, philosophy, religion, politics, etc."
57,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/311026-bill,4,"The book helped me to understand memes and to think about cultures as meme-plexes. Blackmore defines a replicator as anything that can reproduce itself with random variations. She contends that science has proven that evolution of ever more complex organisms will always result once a replicator exists.Once humans evolved the the ability to remember and communicate ideas (memes), we became replicators. the carriers of memes. The plasticity of memory and the impossibility of perfect communication provides random variation and the necessary result of the evolution of memeplexes.If her contentions are correct, viewing cultures as evolutionary super-organisms, competing for survival, becomes a helpful and illuminating perspective in my curiosity about the evolution of human nature. I have found this to as an interesting perspective to think about simple processes such as teaching fly tying, to the much more the complex, such as and how to structure my IRA, Christianity vs. Islamism, and the organizational processes among guides and members of Humanist and Unitarian groups. "
58,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5281363-xylemicarious,4,"Pretty awesome, this book introduced me to how ridiculously powerful and intuitive meme theory is, although some parts near the end started to stretch things a bit. But it does have THE best explanation I have ever heard for how and why humans got their big, complicated brains (It's a really elegant and beautiful description that I can't do much justice to here, but long story short: memes were born). And yes, in case you hadn't realized, the meme machines of the title are humans. It's a pretty friggin' interesting book, and heck, Dawkins likes it. But I don't think too many of Dawkins's writings take the meme idea to its furthest conclusions, which is what Blackmore tries to do. Like I said, it gets kind of fuzzy in some parts near the ends, but mostly her logic is impeccable. It only fails when she starts getting into the spots where the science itself is softer. Mostly forgivable in other words, and entirely worth reading if you can keep an open yet critical mind."

Now when I say memes I don't mean adorable picture of Grumpy Cat with clever little phrases, or photo's of Marilyn Monroe quoting stating some of the most narcissistic phrases I ever seen and treating her like some great philosopher. No I mean the concept of a second replicator in the line of genes that spread from mind to mind. Though a well researched book, and presented well, after about 75% book I lost interest. I attribute this lost of interest in the book to two things, which are more my fault that the authors. One I had just read a book about memes, 'Virus of the Mind' by Richard Brodie, before starting this book, two I have too many books on my shelf and in my Kindle I want to get to, and my interest in this subject just sort of fizzled out.

65,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11319054-andrew-yerkes,5,"This book is a fascinating, well-written discussion of memetics that is grounded in scientific theories that the author clearly introduces and builds upon. Blackmore is arguing that memes are a 2nd replicator, doing in the cultural realm what genes do in terms of biology. Just as there is no consensus between scientific fields about what exactly defines a gene, so too does the concept of meme have some imprecision, as Blackmore admits. The term can refer to a concept in the mind, a PDF copy of a novel, a melody, a recipe, or a social theory, among other things. In short, a meme is any copyable instruction that can be passed from one mind to another. The appeal of memetics as discussed by Blackmore and others is that it allows us to understand cultural change with a model that does not rely on the idea of individual genius or widespread comprehension of an idea, instead showing how an idea can spread based on its ability to lodge itself in people’s minds for any number of reasons related to our biases and intuitions. So for example, religions that rely on faith over reason very effectively insulate themselves, as memes, from competing memes based in reason that might displace religious faith, because they insist that faith must take priority over untrustworthy reason. Seeing cultural evolution through a meme’s eye view, to use Blackmore’s phrase, foregrounds how little truth has to do with widely held ideas.Given the threat that this theory poses to people of religious faith, as well as humanities intellectuals unwelcoming of a scientific theory that seems to threaten pre-existing disciplines, it’s no surprise that the most liked reviews here are negative hatchet jobs full of ad hominem dismissals and mischaracterizations of Blackmore’s argument, claiming for instance that her book argues that everything is a meme, a misreading that she anticipates and tries to correct for in a section entitled “Not Everything Is a Meme.”A more credible critique of the book is that it treats memetics as a science, when in fact it is a metaphor. As a nonscientist, and someone who finds memes very useful to reconsider literary history, especially for the analysis of why a given work became prominent, I have no problem using the concept metaphorically, and don’t really understand why Blackmore and others insist that it is not mere metaphor. I would appreciate reading a more measured critique of the book from a scientific perspective, instead of the sloppy dismissiveness of people who don’t like the book.As far as I’m concerned, it is an excellent and useful introduction not only to memetics but to debates and topics in evolutionary psychology."
66,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"I had a friend other day say he wished he could find a book that would blow his mind the way Dawkins' Selfish Gene did. This title was my suggestion. As Dawkins discusses in his intro to this book, he invented the term meme but had no idea how far people would run with it and how sticky this concept would become. I found the meme chapter of the Selfish Gene incredibly compelling and have had ideas in the direction Blackmore goes rolling around in my head for years. I searched for 'meme' in the personal notes on my phone and the list seems endless including some laughable gems like ""The Purpose of Life and How Memes work"" and ""we are built to transmit lies."" Being curious enough to wonder, but lazy enough never to really look into it, I kept wondering why no one had written ""the selfish meme."" Well I finally stumbled on to it.The core idea here is that while humans are genetic animals spreading genes (DNA based replicators), human evolution also created a new platform for replication, the meme, or transmittable idea. Just as the innovation of simple replicating DNA combinations led to an unfathomable biodiversity, so memetic replication, perhaps initially just used to spread tool making (and to value the good makers as much as the good looking), has led to every permutation of culture and creativity in the human pantheon.Blackmore's exposition feels patient and thoughtful as she proposes basically a new academic field of study and various kinds of studies that might be used to validate or invalidate her claims, and I'm not gonna lie, I started poking around for Ph.D. programs in this direction, but I haven't found any yet.At the end of the book she muses a bit on what this kind of insight has meant to her in her life. Contrasting her approach with Buddhism and some other philosophies (though I'm not sure that's really warranted) she talks about letting the memes drive her a little more and letting her intention step out of the way. This insight I've found pretty helpful."
67,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50113398-shane,5,"Blackmore's book is a very complete, well argued and engaging exploration of the meme and the consequences of treating the 'second replicator' as the locus of cultural evolution.I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in exploring the potential mechanisms behind human culture and society.Although I highly recommend this book, my one criticism is that Blackmore does not seem to be too worried about actually physically identifying the nature of a meme. Given the author's frequent use of comparisons between genes and memes, I feel, this is somewhat of a gap in the logic of her thesis. I say this because the genetic revolution did not, of course, begin until after Crick and Watson confirmed DNA was the molecule of inheritance in 1953. Not to mention that the mechanics of Darwin's theory, which was originally published almost a century before was only finally given a fundamental explanation after it was shown to be expressed through the physical conduit of biological information, the nucleic acid.That said, Blackmore does paint a persuasive picture, and as she often suggests it is up to molecular biologists, neuroscientists and others, to test her ideas and perhaps uncover the physical structure of the meme."
68,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31833834-alexander-smith,3,"This book takes Richard Dawkins' somewhat brief description of memetics to its logical/scientific theoretic ends within a biological framework. To a large extent this book would make sense with older biological theories of neo-Darwinian evolution, but this is not accurate anymore. The Selfish Gene, while influential and important as an idea in genetic theory, is not empirically supported. Genes are ecologies. Thus if the memetic theory still holds, so are memes.Ultimately, this means that memes for Blackmore are not quite as analogous and causal as she assumed. Also, it means that she perhaps got a lot of things right, but with the wrong rhetorical focus. She admits memes are just communicative practices within the first 75 pages, but continues formulating them to be in line with outdated biology. For this theory to survive, she would have done better to start with Information and Communication, and argued out a critical perspective of biology instead of the other way around. It seems, although that subverts the scientific dominance of biological forces and Dawkins, it would have made her theory more accurate to biology today."
69,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"This had some interesting thoughts, but I felt like Blackmore never quite defined what a meme was in her usage, and her apology for not quite defining it was not quite satisfactory. She also didn't clearly show how memes are truly independent of genes, because I don't think they are, and a lot of what she ascribed to memes could just be complex neurology and biology dependent on genes. If memes are a new separate replicator, how are they different from, say, human bodies, which also replicate? Biologists would say that genes make human bodies in order to make more genes, but Blackmore didn't clearly demonstrate why memes aren't also the creation of genes for making more genes.I appreciated her discussion at the end about Self. It's an important discussion, and I think she's on the right track. I'm not sure I love her conclusion about how to live in light of the absence of self, but she's probably logically consistent there. If there's no self and no suffering, there's no enjoying. Ergo, nihilism. Food for thought."

95,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11319054-andrew-yerkes,5,"This book is a fascinating, well-written discussion of memetics that is grounded in scientific theories that the author clearly introduces and builds upon. Blackmore is arguing that memes are a 2nd replicator, doing in the cultural realm what genes do in terms of biology. Just as there is no consensus between scientific fields about what exactly defines a gene, so too does the concept of meme have some imprecision, as Blackmore admits. The term can refer to a concept in the mind, a PDF copy of a novel, a melody, a recipe, or a social theory, among other things. In short, a meme is any copyable instruction that can be passed from one mind to another. The appeal of memetics as discussed by Blackmore and others is that it allows us to understand cultural change with a model that does not rely on the idea of individual genius or widespread comprehension of an idea, instead showing how an idea can spread based on its ability to lodge itself in people’s minds for any number of reasons related to our biases and intuitions. So for example, religions that rely on faith over reason very effectively insulate themselves, as memes, from competing memes based in reason that might displace religious faith, because they insist that faith must take priority over untrustworthy reason. Seeing cultural evolution through a meme’s eye view, to use Blackmore’s phrase, foregrounds how little truth has to do with widely held ideas.Given the threat that this theory poses to people of religious faith, as well as humanities intellectuals unwelcoming of a scientific theory that seems to threaten pre-existing disciplines, it’s no surprise that the most liked reviews here are negative hatchet jobs full of ad hominem dismissals and mischaracterizations of Blackmore’s argument, claiming for instance that her book argues that everything is a meme, a misreading that she anticipates and tries to correct for in a section entitled “Not Everything Is a Meme.”A more credible critique of the book is that it treats memetics as a science, when in fact it is a metaphor. As a nonscientist, and someone who finds memes very useful to reconsider literary history, especially for the analysis of why a given work became prominent, I have no problem using the concept metaphorically, and don’t really understand why Blackmore and others insist that it is not mere metaphor. I would appreciate reading a more measured critique of the book from a scientific perspective, instead of the sloppy dismissiveness of people who don’t like the book.As far as I’m concerned, it is an excellent and useful introduction not only to memetics but to debates and topics in evolutionary psychology."
96,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"I had a friend other day say he wished he could find a book that would blow his mind the way Dawkins' Selfish Gene did. This title was my suggestion. As Dawkins discusses in his intro to this book, he invented the term meme but had no idea how far people would run with it and how sticky this concept would become. I found the meme chapter of the Selfish Gene incredibly compelling and have had ideas in the direction Blackmore goes rolling around in my head for years. I searched for 'meme' in the personal notes on my phone and the list seems endless including some laughable gems like ""The Purpose of Life and How Memes work"" and ""we are built to transmit lies."" Being curious enough to wonder, but lazy enough never to really look into it, I kept wondering why no one had written ""the selfish meme."" Well I finally stumbled on to it.The core idea here is that while humans are genetic animals spreading genes (DNA based replicators), human evolution also created a new platform for replication, the meme, or transmittable idea. Just as the innovation of simple replicating DNA combinations led to an unfathomable biodiversity, so memetic replication, perhaps initially just used to spread tool making (and to value the good makers as much as the good looking), has led to every permutation of culture and creativity in the human pantheon.Blackmore's exposition feels patient and thoughtful as she proposes basically a new academic field of study and various kinds of studies that might be used to validate or invalidate her claims, and I'm not gonna lie, I started poking around for Ph.D. programs in this direction, but I haven't found any yet.At the end of the book she muses a bit on what this kind of insight has meant to her in her life. Contrasting her approach with Buddhism and some other philosophies (though I'm not sure that's really warranted) she talks about letting the memes drive her a little more and letting her intention step out of the way. This insight I've found pretty helpful."
97,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50113398-shane,5,"Blackmore's book is a very complete, well argued and engaging exploration of the meme and the consequences of treating the 'second replicator' as the locus of cultural evolution.I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in exploring the potential mechanisms behind human culture and society.Although I highly recommend this book, my one criticism is that Blackmore does not seem to be too worried about actually physically identifying the nature of a meme. Given the author's frequent use of comparisons between genes and memes, I feel, this is somewhat of a gap in the logic of her thesis. I say this because the genetic revolution did not, of course, begin until after Crick and Watson confirmed DNA was the molecule of inheritance in 1953. Not to mention that the mechanics of Darwin's theory, which was originally published almost a century before was only finally given a fundamental explanation after it was shown to be expressed through the physical conduit of biological information, the nucleic acid.That said, Blackmore does paint a persuasive picture, and as she often suggests it is up to molecular biologists, neuroscientists and others, to test her ideas and perhaps uncover the physical structure of the meme."
98,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31833834-alexander-smith,3,"This book takes Richard Dawkins' somewhat brief description of memetics to its logical/scientific theoretic ends within a biological framework. To a large extent this book would make sense with older biological theories of neo-Darwinian evolution, but this is not accurate anymore. The Selfish Gene, while influential and important as an idea in genetic theory, is not empirically supported. Genes are ecologies. Thus if the memetic theory still holds, so are memes.Ultimately, this means that memes for Blackmore are not quite as analogous and causal as she assumed. Also, it means that she perhaps got a lot of things right, but with the wrong rhetorical focus. She admits memes are just communicative practices within the first 75 pages, but continues formulating them to be in line with outdated biology. For this theory to survive, she would have done better to start with Information and Communication, and argued out a critical perspective of biology instead of the other way around. It seems, although that subverts the scientific dominance of biological forces and Dawkins, it would have made her theory more accurate to biology today."
99,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"This had some interesting thoughts, but I felt like Blackmore never quite defined what a meme was in her usage, and her apology for not quite defining it was not quite satisfactory. She also didn't clearly show how memes are truly independent of genes, because I don't think they are, and a lot of what she ascribed to memes could just be complex neurology and biology dependent on genes. If memes are a new separate replicator, how are they different from, say, human bodies, which also replicate? Biologists would say that genes make human bodies in order to make more genes, but Blackmore didn't clearly demonstrate why memes aren't also the creation of genes for making more genes.I appreciated her discussion at the end about Self. It's an important discussion, and I think she's on the right track. I'm not sure I love her conclusion about how to live in light of the absence of self, but she's probably logically consistent there. If there's no self and no suffering, there's no enjoying. Ergo, nihilism. Food for thought."

112,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784353-s-hi,3,"The meme is the latest addition to that old argument about nature versus nurture. To some it is an analogy which doesn’t bear scientific investigation, for others it is the multiplier effect allowing them to expand their work and apply for research support while they consider the broader significance and potential of this idea for a range of purposes.The very fact that the person who first posited the meme is the person providing a foreword for this book, shows how memes can be constructed to be what you want them to be, and therefore what they mean. It is reiteration of both practice and of interpretation which allow memes to exist. Yoko Ono once said: “A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” By picking up each other’s conversation and spreading it through their respective communities Blackmore and Dawkins are constructing the meme of the meme. They are monitoring whether they have yet created the critical mass for it to take on a life of its own – which genes do not appear to be able to do as they are body-bound, whereas the meme can detach from any specific body, and provided there is a means of communication between it and other bodies, can appear at great distances from the initiating meme producer.This pathway is similar to the practice within neuro-linguistic programming which aids the persistence of conditions by embedding reference to them in their denial, reversal and all manner of repetitions on a theme (notice how that word is so similar to meme?). It is a magician’s trick that creates a vacuum by creating so much attention around the space within which you wish the vacuum to exist, that you can make whatever is in that space seem to disappear.This is the way to deal with opposition. Ask any politician. Denial of great enough proportions in this way can even create a black hole into which all terms other than those one wants to explore disappear from the universe. That Dawkins himself refers to pyramid schemes (oh, there’s another similar word, is there a pattern arising here that might be a hidden meme?) as being dangerous forms of memes, before rapidly correcting himself to the neutrality of memes, as the neutrality of genes, and then saying the interpretation of their meaning is up to us and the use we put them to. All of this is of course the very process he is pointing out with the meme concept to begin with. Having given a name to this thing, I can now make everything I say from this point on reflect back to that concept, and so make that concept appear real until the moment within which others take it on board and confirm my opinion which I want them to carry on my behalf. When I convince enough people to carry it in some way, then it begins to have a momentum (or should that be momentum?) in its own right, and I have birthed the proof of its reality beyond my own individual dream for its existence. I just have to get people talking about it without them begin aware where it originated. I just have to be repetitive and persistent enough that people want to deny what I am saying, and their denial becomes the reinforcer which depersonalises it from my beginning. I just have to irritate and allow the processes of conflict to permeate subconsciously in the far more effective way it operates than consciousness.It helps enormously that there is so much technology out there to support such methods.Even I am now part of it, simply because I have decided to write book reviews about everything I read, whether I find any merit in their central messages or not. I don’t have to have anymore commitment to this particular meme than any other. I merely need my own motivating force to add to the pieces others put out there for me to stumble upon and incorporate into my own flow. I take it with me, and like any virus, it spreads.Interestingly, where genes are considered to be fixed identities in their own right, and replicated by the reversal mode of the formative RNA against which DNA pairs itself, memes are considered to only become memes by combination with enough other ‘like’ components to make them companions introducing each other to not-so-like companions where they can leave trace amounts of their influence, without having to replicate fully each and every time. This ability to act in a variations-on-a-theme (there it is again) way, which includes denial of the theme, refinement of the theme, inclusions and exclusions in specific studies and conversations over a period of time, makes the permeation of a meme into consciousness very appealing.But does that make it any more than a cosmic joke god is playing on us – even if that god is Richard Dawkins? Read this book and you may be able to draw your own conclusions. Or maybe you need to avoid it to do that, and reading this book will only allow you to draw the conclusions Richard Dawkins and his colleagues have lay out for you. You decide.

Blackmore is arguing that memes are a 2nd replicator, doing in the cultural realm what genes do in terms of biology.

The term can refer to a concept in the mind, a PDF copy of a novel, a melody, a recipe, or a social theory, among other things. In short, a meme is any copyable instruction that can be passed from one mind to another. The appeal of memetics as discussed by Blackmore and others is that it allows us to understand cultural change with a model that does not rely on the idea of individual genius or widespread comprehension of an idea, instead showing how an idea can spread based on its ability to lodge itself in people’s minds for any number of reasons related to our biases and intuitions. So for example, religions that rely on faith over reason very effectively insulate themselves, as memes, from competing memes based in reason that might displace religious faith, because they insist that faith must take priority over untrustworthy reason. Seeing cultural evolution through a meme’s eye view, to use Blackmore’s phrase, foregrounds how little truth has to do with widely held ideas.Given the threat that this theory poses to people of religious faith, as well as humanities intellectuals unwelcoming of a scientific theory that seems to threaten pre-existing disciplines, it’s no surprise that the most liked reviews here are negative hatchet jobs full of ad hominem dismissals and mischaracterizations of Blackmore’s argument, claiming for instance that her book argues that everything is a meme, a misreading that she anticipates and tries to correct for in a section entitled “Not Everything Is a Meme.”A more credible critique of the book is that it treats memetics as a science, when in fact it is a metaphor.

142,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784353-s-hi,3,"The meme is the latest addition to that old argument about nature versus nurture. To some it is an analogy which doesn’t bear scientific investigation, for others it is the multiplier effect allowing them to expand their work and apply for research support while they consider the broader significance and potential of this idea for a range of purposes.The very fact that the person who first posited the meme is the person providing a foreword for this book, shows how memes can be constructed to be what you want them to be, and therefore what they mean. It is reiteration of both practice and of interpretation which allow memes to exist. Yoko Ono once said: “A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” By picking up each other’s conversation and spreading it through their respective communities Blackmore and Dawkins are constructing the meme of the meme. They are monitoring whether they have yet created the critical mass for it to take on a life of its own – which genes do not appear to be able to do as they are body-bound, whereas the meme can detach from any specific body, and provided there is a means of communication between it and other bodies, can appear at great distances from the initiating meme producer.This pathway is similar to the practice within neuro-linguistic programming which aids the persistence of conditions by embedding reference to them in their denial, reversal and all manner of repetitions on a theme (notice how that word is so similar to meme?). It is a magician’s trick that creates a vacuum by creating so much attention around the space within which you wish the vacuum to exist, that you can make whatever is in that space seem to disappear.This is the way to deal with opposition. Ask any politician. Denial of great enough proportions in this way can even create a black hole into which all terms other than those one wants to explore disappear from the universe. That Dawkins himself refers to pyramid schemes (oh, there’s another similar word, is there a pattern arising here that might be a hidden meme?) as being dangerous forms of memes, before rapidly correcting himself to the neutrality of memes, as the neutrality of genes, and then saying the interpretation of their meaning is up to us and the use we put them to. All of this is of course the very process he is pointing out with the meme concept to begin with. Having given a name to this thing, I can now make everything I say from this point on reflect back to that concept, and so make that concept appear real until the moment within which others take it on board and confirm my opinion which I want them to carry on my behalf. When I convince enough people to carry it in some way, then it begins to have a momentum (or should that be momentum?) in its own right, and I have birthed the proof of its reality beyond my own individual dream for its existence. I just have to get people talking about it without them begin aware where it originated. I just have to be repetitive and persistent enough that people want to deny what I am saying, and their denial becomes the reinforcer which depersonalises it from my beginning. I just have to irritate and allow the processes of conflict to permeate subconsciously in the far more effective way it operates than consciousness.It helps enormously that there is so much technology out there to support such methods.Even I am now part of it, simply because I have decided to write book reviews about everything I read, whether I find any merit in their central messages or not. I don’t have to have anymore commitment to this particular meme than any other. I merely need my own motivating force to add to the pieces others put out there for me to stumble upon and incorporate into my own flow. I take it with me, and like any virus, it spreads.Interestingly, where genes are considered to be fixed identities in their own right, and replicated by the reversal mode of the formative RNA against which DNA pairs itself, memes are considered to only become memes by combination with enough other ‘like’ components to make them companions introducing each other to not-so-like companions where they can leave trace amounts of their influence, without having to replicate fully each and every time. This ability to act in a variations-on-a-theme (there it is again) way, which includes denial of the theme, refinement of the theme, inclusions and exclusions in specific studies and conversations over a period of time, makes the permeation of a meme into consciousness very appealing.But does that make it any more than a cosmic joke god is playing on us – even if that god is Richard Dawkins? Read this book and you may be able to draw your own conclusions. Or maybe you need to avoid it to do that, and reading this book will only allow you to draw the conclusions Richard Dawkins and his colleagues have lay out for you. You decide. Or not.(did I mention scheme? No, that’s too much like a conspiracy theory…)Enjoy."

145,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19256190-todd-allen,4,"Richard Dawkins, in his book the Selfish Gene, provided a springboard—the idea of a meme—from which Susan Blackmore in her book expands upon and uses to better explain social phenomena that are otherwise seemingly intractable. Other biological curiosities unique only to humans—up to this point, as far as we know—are also expanded upon in this book and examined from a meme’s perspective. Like genes, memes have no modus operandi other than their own duplication. That their duplication is not error-free is the key component of the process that has led to the varied wonders and tragedies of the collective human experience. There is no ghost in the machine, no intentionality, no unseen being in control, directing the memes to their most ‘useful’ form. Human constructs, however much cherished, are nothing more than memeplexes cohabitating and/ or battling-it-out in an environment which contains the key ingredients required for their continued existence.I found the author’s thesis to be a palatable explanation of the variety of phenomena that have resulted from the evolution of the human mind. By applying the idea of Universal Darwinism, where the common denominators across replicating devices are fidelity, fecundity and longevity, she is able to provide a framework from a meme’s mechanistic point of view, which, like a gene’s, is based on its ability to copy itself multiple times with imperfect copies being selected for in the ever-changing contexts in which it and its predecessors came to be. Alas, it seems the ‘meme-craze’ has subsided, based on my inability to find anything current on the topic. My limited research indicated that Susan Blackmore has moved on to other endeavors unassociated with further development of the meme hypothesis."
146,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"Blackmore talks about memes. This term, that is, the ""meme"" was first coined by Richard Dawkins (in ""The Selfish Gene"" which was also a good read). It is basically any idea or behavior that can be transferred from one organism to another by imitation. Much like a gene, a meme has the properties of fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is this replicator medium that allowed for the cultural tranformation of our species. Blackmore goes into depth asserting that our minds are best understood in terms of memetic selection -- that is, a second form of natural selection. We can think of memetic selection as a second level of complexity originating from it's predecessor, the gene. Certainly the advent of human language, and most notably written language, caused a catalyst for memes to improve in terms of their fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is a great explanation for why certain religions stand the test of time as well; a combination of memes and writing systems. For example, religions that preach to others to spread the religion, to write it down, and to make it one that will reward those that follow it and punish those that don't -- it is no surprise that the especially superstitious and gullible masses of the general population in the past would be drawn to these religions, and after the myths and legends change over time (and the theology that accompanies it), we are left with believers til' this day. The meme is a powerful entity and certainly one that deserves careful investigation when discussing various topics including but not limited to: human evolution, cultural evolution, philosophy, religion, politics, etc."
147,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/311026-bill,4,"The book helped me to understand memes and to think about cultures as meme-plexes. Blackmore defines a replicator as anything that can reproduce itself with random variations. She contends that science has proven that evolution of ever more complex organisms will always result once a replicator exists.Once humans evolved the the ability to remember and communicate ideas (memes), we became replicators. the carriers of memes. The plasticity of memory and the impossibility of perfect communication provides random variation and the necessary result of the evolution of memeplexes.If her contentions are correct, viewing cultures as evolutionary super-organisms, competing for survival, becomes a helpful and illuminating perspective in my curiosity about the evolution of human nature. I have found this to as an interesting perspective to think about simple processes such as teaching fly tying, to the much more the complex, such as and how to structure my IRA, Christianity vs. Islamism, and the organizational processes among guides and members of Humanist and Unitarian groups. "
148,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5281363-xylemicarious,4,"Pretty awesome, this book introduced me to how ridiculously powerful and intuitive meme theory is, although some parts near the end started to stretch things a bit. But it does have THE best explanation I have ever heard for how and why humans got their big, complicated brains (It's a really elegant and beautiful description that I can't do much justice to here, but long story short: memes were born). And yes, in case you hadn't realized, the meme machines of the title are humans. It's a pretty friggin' interesting book, and heck, Dawkins likes it. But I don't think too many of Dawkins's writings take the meme idea to its furthest conclusions, which is what Blackmore tries to do. Like I said, it gets kind of fuzzy in some parts near the ends, but mostly her logic is impeccable. It only fails when she starts getting into the spots where the science itself is softer. Mostly forgivable in other words, and entirely worth reading if you can keep an open yet critical mind."

No I mean the concept of a second replicator in the line of genes that spread from mind to mind. Though a well researched book, and presented well, after about 75% book I lost interest. I attribute this lost of interest in the book to two things, which are more my fault that the authors. One I had just read a book about memes, 'Virus of the Mind' by Richard Brodie, before starting this book, two I have too many books on my shelf and in my Kindle I want to get to, and my interest in this subject just sort of fizzled out.

175,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19256190-todd-allen,4,"Richard Dawkins, in his book the Selfish Gene, provided a springboard—the idea of a meme—from which Susan Blackmore in her book expands upon and uses to better explain social phenomena that are otherwise seemingly intractable. Other biological curiosities unique only to humans—up to this point, as far as we know—are also expanded upon in this book and examined from a meme’s perspective. Like genes, memes have no modus operandi other than their own duplication. That their duplication is not error-free is the key component of the process that has led to the varied wonders and tragedies of the collective human experience. There is no ghost in the machine, no intentionality, no unseen being in control, directing the memes to their most ‘useful’ form. Human constructs, however much cherished, are nothing more than memeplexes cohabitating and/ or battling-it-out in an environment which contains the key ingredients required for their continued existence.I found the author’s thesis to be a palatable explanation of the variety of phenomena that have resulted from the evolution of the human mind. By applying the idea of Universal Darwinism, where the common denominators across replicating devices are fidelity, fecundity and longevity, she is able to provide a framework from a meme’s mechanistic point of view, which, like a gene’s, is based on its ability to copy itself multiple times with imperfect copies being selected for in the ever-changing contexts in which it and its predecessors came to be. Alas, it seems the ‘meme-craze’ has subsided, based on my inability to find anything current on the topic. My limited research indicated that Susan Blackmore has moved on to other endeavors unassociated with further development of the meme hypothesis."
176,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"Blackmore talks about memes. This term, that is, the ""meme"" was first coined by Richard Dawkins (in ""The Selfish Gene"" which was also a good read). It is basically any idea or behavior that can be transferred from one organism to another by imitation. Much like a gene, a meme has the properties of fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is this replicator medium that allowed for the cultural tranformation of our species. Blackmore goes into depth asserting that our minds are best understood in terms of memetic selection -- that is, a second form of natural selection. We can think of memetic selection as a second level of complexity originating from it's predecessor, the gene. Certainly the advent of human language, and most notably written language, caused a catalyst for memes to improve in terms of their fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is a great explanation for why certain religions stand the test of time as well; a combination of memes and writing systems. For example, religions that preach to others to spread the religion, to write it down, and to make it one that will reward those that follow it and punish those that don't -- it is no surprise that the especially superstitious and gullible masses of the general population in the past would be drawn to these religions, and after the myths and legends change over time (and the theology that accompanies it), we are left with believers til' this day. The meme is a powerful entity and certainly one that deserves careful investigation when discussing various topics including but not limited to: human evolution, cultural evolution, philosophy, religion, politics, etc."
177,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/311026-bill,4,"The book helped me to understand memes and to think about cultures as meme-plexes. Blackmore defines a replicator as anything that can reproduce itself with random variations. She contends that science has proven that evolution of ever more complex organisms will always result once a replicator exists.Once humans evolved the the ability to remember and communicate ideas (memes), we became replicators. the carriers of memes. The plasticity of memory and the impossibility of perfect communication provides random variation and the necessary result of the evolution of memeplexes.If her contentions are correct, viewing cultures as evolutionary super-organisms, competing for survival, becomes a helpful and illuminating perspective in my curiosity about the evolution of human nature. I have found this to as an interesting perspective to think about simple processes such as teaching fly tying, to the much more the complex, such as and how to structure my IRA, Christianity vs. Islamism, and the organizational processes among guides and members of Humanist and Unitarian groups. "
178,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5281363-xylemicarious,4,"Pretty awesome, this book introduced me to how ridiculously powerful and intuitive meme theory is, although some parts near the end started to stretch things a bit. But it does have THE best explanation I have ever heard for how and why humans got their big, complicated brains (It's a really elegant and beautiful description that I can't do much justice to here, but long story short: memes were born). And yes, in case you hadn't realized, the meme machines of the title are humans. It's a pretty friggin' interesting book, and heck, Dawkins likes it. But I don't think too many of Dawkins's writings take the meme idea to its furthest conclusions, which is what Blackmore tries to do. Like I said, it gets kind of fuzzy in some parts near the ends, but mostly her logic is impeccable. It only fails when she starts getting into the spots where the science itself is softer. Mostly forgivable in other words, and entirely worth reading if you can keep an open yet critical mind."

No I mean the concept of a second replicator in the line of genes that spread from mind to mind. Though a well researched book, and presented well, after about 75% book I lost interest. I attribute this lost of interest in the book to two things, which are more my fault that the authors. One I had just read a book about memes, 'Virus of the Mind' by Richard Brodie, before starting this book, two I have too many books on my shelf and in my Kindle I want to get to, and my interest in this subject just sort of fizzled out.

185,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11319054-andrew-yerkes,5,"This book is a fascinating, well-written discussion of memetics that is grounded in scientific theories that the author clearly introduces and builds upon. Blackmore is arguing that memes are a 2nd replicator, doing in the cultural realm what genes do in terms of biology. Just as there is no consensus between scientific fields about what exactly defines a gene, so too does the concept of meme have some imprecision, as Blackmore admits. The term can refer to a concept in the mind, a PDF copy of a novel, a melody, a recipe, or a social theory, among other things. In short, a meme is any copyable instruction that can be passed from one mind to another. The appeal of memetics as discussed by Blackmore and others is that it allows us to understand cultural change with a model that does not rely on the idea of individual genius or widespread comprehension of an idea, instead showing how an idea can spread based on its ability to lodge itself in people’s minds for any number of reasons related to our biases and intuitions. So for example, religions that rely on faith over reason very effectively insulate themselves, as memes, from competing memes based in reason that might displace religious faith, because they insist that faith must take priority over untrustworthy reason. Seeing cultural evolution through a meme’s eye view, to use Blackmore’s phrase, foregrounds how little truth has to do with widely held ideas.Given the threat that this theory poses to people of religious faith, as well as humanities intellectuals unwelcoming of a scientific theory that seems to threaten pre-existing disciplines, it’s no surprise that the most liked reviews here are negative hatchet jobs full of ad hominem dismissals and mischaracterizations of Blackmore’s argument, claiming for instance that her book argues that everything is a meme, a misreading that she anticipates and tries to correct for in a section entitled “Not Everything Is a Meme.”A more credible critique of the book is that it treats memetics as a science, when in fact it is a metaphor. As a nonscientist, and someone who finds memes very useful to reconsider literary history, especially for the analysis of why a given work became prominent, I have no problem using the concept metaphorically, and don’t really understand why Blackmore and others insist that it is not mere metaphor. I would appreciate reading a more measured critique of the book from a scientific perspective, instead of the sloppy dismissiveness of people who don’t like the book.As far as I’m concerned, it is an excellent and useful introduction not only to memetics but to debates and topics in evolutionary psychology."
186,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"I had a friend other day say he wished he could find a book that would blow his mind the way Dawkins' Selfish Gene did. This title was my suggestion. As Dawkins discusses in his intro to this book, he invented the term meme but had no idea how far people would run with it and how sticky this concept would become. I found the meme chapter of the Selfish Gene incredibly compelling and have had ideas in the direction Blackmore goes rolling around in my head for years. I searched for 'meme' in the personal notes on my phone and the list seems endless including some laughable gems like ""The Purpose of Life and How Memes work"" and ""we are built to transmit lies."" Being curious enough to wonder, but lazy enough never to really look into it, I kept wondering why no one had written ""the selfish meme."" Well I finally stumbled on to it.The core idea here is that while humans are genetic animals spreading genes (DNA based replicators), human evolution also created a new platform for replication, the meme, or transmittable idea. Just as the innovation of simple replicating DNA combinations led to an unfathomable biodiversity, so memetic replication, perhaps initially just used to spread tool making (and to value the good makers as much as the good looking), has led to every permutation of culture and creativity in the human pantheon.Blackmore's exposition feels patient and thoughtful as she proposes basically a new academic field of study and various kinds of studies that might be used to validate or invalidate her claims, and I'm not gonna lie, I started poking around for Ph.D. programs in this direction, but I haven't found any yet.At the end of the book she muses a bit on what this kind of insight has meant to her in her life. Contrasting her approach with Buddhism and some other philosophies (though I'm not sure that's really warranted) she talks about letting the memes drive her a little more and letting her intention step out of the way. This insight I've found pretty helpful."
187,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50113398-shane,5,"Blackmore's book is a very complete, well argued and engaging exploration of the meme and the consequences of treating the 'second replicator' as the locus of cultural evolution.I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in exploring the potential mechanisms behind human culture and society.Although I highly recommend this book, my one criticism is that Blackmore does not seem to be too worried about actually physically identifying the nature of a meme. Given the author's frequent use of comparisons between genes and memes, I feel, this is somewhat of a gap in the logic of her thesis. I say this because the genetic revolution did not, of course, begin until after Crick and Watson confirmed DNA was the molecule of inheritance in 1953. Not to mention that the mechanics of Darwin's theory, which was originally published almost a century before was only finally given a fundamental explanation after it was shown to be expressed through the physical conduit of biological information, the nucleic acid.That said, Blackmore does paint a persuasive picture, and as she often suggests it is up to molecular biologists, neuroscientists and others, to test her ideas and perhaps uncover the physical structure of the meme."
188,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31833834-alexander-smith,3,"This book takes Richard Dawkins' somewhat brief description of memetics to its logical/scientific theoretic ends within a biological framework. To a large extent this book would make sense with older biological theories of neo-Darwinian evolution, but this is not accurate anymore. The Selfish Gene, while influential and important as an idea in genetic theory, is not empirically supported. Genes are ecologies. Thus if the memetic theory still holds, so are memes.Ultimately, this means that memes for Blackmore are not quite as analogous and causal as she assumed. Also, it means that she perhaps got a lot of things right, but with the wrong rhetorical focus. She admits memes are just communicative practices within the first 75 pages, but continues formulating them to be in line with outdated biology. For this theory to survive, she would have done better to start with Information and Communication, and argued out a critical perspective of biology instead of the other way around. It seems, although that subverts the scientific dominance of biological forces and Dawkins, it would have made her theory more accurate to biology today."
189,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"This had some interesting thoughts, but I felt like Blackmore never quite defined what a meme was in her usage, and her apology for not quite defining it was not quite satisfactory. She also didn't clearly show how memes are truly independent of genes, because I don't think they are, and a lot of what she ascribed to memes could just be complex neurology and biology dependent on genes. If memes are a new separate replicator, how are they different from, say, human bodies, which also replicate? Biologists would say that genes make human bodies in order to make more genes, but Blackmore didn't clearly demonstrate why memes aren't also the creation of genes for making more genes.I appreciated her discussion at the end about Self. It's an important discussion, and I think she's on the right track. I'm not sure I love her conclusion about how to live in light of the absence of self, but she's probably logically consistent there. If there's no self and no suffering, there's no enjoying. Ergo, nihilism. Food for thought."

215,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11319054-andrew-yerkes,5,"This book is a fascinating, well-written discussion of memetics that is grounded in scientific theories that the author clearly introduces and builds upon. Blackmore is arguing that memes are a 2nd replicator, doing in the cultural realm what genes do in terms of biology. Just as there is no consensus between scientific fields about what exactly defines a gene, so too does the concept of meme have some imprecision, as Blackmore admits. The term can refer to a concept in the mind, a PDF copy of a novel, a melody, a recipe, or a social theory, among other things. In short, a meme is any copyable instruction that can be passed from one mind to another. The appeal of memetics as discussed by Blackmore and others is that it allows us to understand cultural change with a model that does not rely on the idea of individual genius or widespread comprehension of an idea, instead showing how an idea can spread based on its ability to lodge itself in people’s minds for any number of reasons related to our biases and intuitions. So for example, religions that rely on faith over reason very effectively insulate themselves, as memes, from competing memes based in reason that might displace religious faith, because they insist that faith must take priority over untrustworthy reason. Seeing cultural evolution through a meme’s eye view, to use Blackmore’s phrase, foregrounds how little truth has to do with widely held ideas.Given the threat that this theory poses to people of religious faith, as well as humanities intellectuals unwelcoming of a scientific theory that seems to threaten pre-existing disciplines, it’s no surprise that the most liked reviews here are negative hatchet jobs full of ad hominem dismissals and mischaracterizations of Blackmore’s argument, claiming for instance that her book argues that everything is a meme, a misreading that she anticipates and tries to correct for in a section entitled “Not Everything Is a Meme.”A more credible critique of the book is that it treats memetics as a science, when in fact it is a metaphor. As a nonscientist, and someone who finds memes very useful to reconsider literary history, especially for the analysis of why a given work became prominent, I have no problem using the concept metaphorically, and don’t really understand why Blackmore and others insist that it is not mere metaphor. I would appreciate reading a more measured critique of the book from a scientific perspective, instead of the sloppy dismissiveness of people who don’t like the book.As far as I’m concerned, it is an excellent and useful introduction not only to memetics but to debates and topics in evolutionary psychology."
216,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"I had a friend other day say he wished he could find a book that would blow his mind the way Dawkins' Selfish Gene did. This title was my suggestion. As Dawkins discusses in his intro to this book, he invented the term meme but had no idea how far people would run with it and how sticky this concept would become. I found the meme chapter of the Selfish Gene incredibly compelling and have had ideas in the direction Blackmore goes rolling around in my head for years. I searched for 'meme' in the personal notes on my phone and the list seems endless including some laughable gems like ""The Purpose of Life and How Memes work"" and ""we are built to transmit lies."" Being curious enough to wonder, but lazy enough never to really look into it, I kept wondering why no one had written ""the selfish meme."" Well I finally stumbled on to it.The core idea here is that while humans are genetic animals spreading genes (DNA based replicators), human evolution also created a new platform for replication, the meme, or transmittable idea. Just as the innovation of simple replicating DNA combinations led to an unfathomable biodiversity, so memetic replication, perhaps initially just used to spread tool making (and to value the good makers as much as the good looking), has led to every permutation of culture and creativity in the human pantheon.Blackmore's exposition feels patient and thoughtful as she proposes basically a new academic field of study and various kinds of studies that might be used to validate or invalidate her claims, and I'm not gonna lie, I started poking around for Ph.D. programs in this direction, but I haven't found any yet.At the end of the book she muses a bit on what this kind of insight has meant to her in her life. Contrasting her approach with Buddhism and some other philosophies (though I'm not sure that's really warranted) she talks about letting the memes drive her a little more and letting her intention step out of the way. This insight I've found pretty helpful."
217,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50113398-shane,5,"Blackmore's book is a very complete, well argued and engaging exploration of the meme and the consequences of treating the 'second replicator' as the locus of cultural evolution.I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in exploring the potential mechanisms behind human culture and society.Although I highly recommend this book, my one criticism is that Blackmore does not seem to be too worried about actually physically identifying the nature of a meme. Given the author's frequent use of comparisons between genes and memes, I feel, this is somewhat of a gap in the logic of her thesis. I say this because the genetic revolution did not, of course, begin until after Crick and Watson confirmed DNA was the molecule of inheritance in 1953. Not to mention that the mechanics of Darwin's theory, which was originally published almost a century before was only finally given a fundamental explanation after it was shown to be expressed through the physical conduit of biological information, the nucleic acid.That said, Blackmore does paint a persuasive picture, and as she often suggests it is up to molecular biologists, neuroscientists and others, to test her ideas and perhaps uncover the physical structure of the meme."
218,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31833834-alexander-smith,3,"This book takes Richard Dawkins' somewhat brief description of memetics to its logical/scientific theoretic ends within a biological framework. To a large extent this book would make sense with older biological theories of neo-Darwinian evolution, but this is not accurate anymore. The Selfish Gene, while influential and important as an idea in genetic theory, is not empirically supported. Genes are ecologies. Thus if the memetic theory still holds, so are memes.Ultimately, this means that memes for Blackmore are not quite as analogous and causal as she assumed. Also, it means that she perhaps got a lot of things right, but with the wrong rhetorical focus. She admits memes are just communicative practices within the first 75 pages, but continues formulating them to be in line with outdated biology. For this theory to survive, she would have done better to start with Information and Communication, and argued out a critical perspective of biology instead of the other way around. It seems, although that subverts the scientific dominance of biological forces and Dawkins, it would have made her theory more accurate to biology today."
219,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"This had some interesting thoughts, but I felt like Blackmore never quite defined what a meme was in her usage, and her apology for not quite defining it was not quite satisfactory. She also didn't clearly show how memes are truly independent of genes, because I don't think they are, and a lot of what she ascribed to memes could just be complex neurology and biology dependent on genes. If memes are a new separate replicator, how are they different from, say, human bodies, which also replicate? Biologists would say that genes make human bodies in order to make more genes, but Blackmore didn't clearly demonstrate why memes aren't also the creation of genes for making more genes.I appreciated her discussion at the end about Self. It's an important discussion, and I think she's on the right track. I'm not sure I love her conclusion about how to live in light of the absence of self, but she's probably logically consistent there. If there's no self and no suffering, there's no enjoying. Ergo, nihilism. Food for thought."

I'm really disappointed that memetics didn't take off much after the publishing of this book— the idea had so much potential! "

232,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784353-s-hi,3,"The meme is the latest addition to that old argument about nature versus nurture. To some it is an analogy which doesn’t bear scientific investigation, for others it is the multiplier effect allowing them to expand their work and apply for research support while they consider the broader significance and potential of this idea for a range of purposes.The very fact that the person who first posited the meme is the person providing a foreword for this book, shows how memes can be constructed to be what you want them to be, and therefore what they mean. It is reiteration of both practice and of interpretation which allow memes to exist. Yoko Ono once said: “A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” By picking up each other’s conversation and spreading it through their respective communities Blackmore and Dawkins are constructing the meme of the meme. They are monitoring whether they have yet created the critical mass for it to take on a life of its own – which genes do not appear to be able to do as they are body-bound, whereas the meme can detach from any specific body, and provided there is a means of communication between it and other bodies, can appear at great distances from the initiating meme producer.This pathway is similar to the practice within neuro-linguistic programming which aids the persistence of conditions by embedding reference to them in their denial, reversal and all manner of repetitions on a theme (notice how that word is so similar to meme?). It is a magician’s trick that creates a vacuum by creating so much attention around the space within which you wish the vacuum to exist, that you can make whatever is in that space seem to disappear.This is the way to deal with opposition. Ask any politician. Denial of great enough proportions in this way can even create a black hole into which all terms other than those one wants to explore disappear from the universe. That Dawkins himself refers to pyramid schemes (oh, there’s another similar word, is there a pattern arising here that might be a hidden meme?) as being dangerous forms of memes, before rapidly correcting himself to the neutrality of memes, as the neutrality of genes, and then saying the interpretation of their meaning is up to us and the use we put them to. All of this is of course the very process he is pointing out with the meme concept to begin with. Having given a name to this thing, I can now make everything I say from this point on reflect back to that concept, and so make that concept appear real until the moment within which others take it on board and confirm my opinion which I want them to carry on my behalf. When I convince enough people to carry it in some way, then it begins to have a momentum (or should that be momentum?) in its own right, and I have birthed the proof of its reality beyond my own individual dream for its existence. I just have to get people talking about it without them begin aware where it originated. I just have to be repetitive and persistent enough that people want to deny what I am saying, and their denial becomes the reinforcer which depersonalises it from my beginning. I just have to irritate and allow the processes of conflict to permeate subconsciously in the far more effective way it operates than consciousness.It helps enormously that there is so much technology out there to support such methods.Even I am now part of it, simply because I have decided to write book reviews about everything I read, whether I find any merit in their central messages or not. I don’t have to have anymore commitment to this particular meme than any other. I merely need my own motivating force to add to the pieces others put out there for me to stumble upon and incorporate into my own flow. I take it with me, and like any virus, it spreads.Interestingly, where genes are considered to be fixed identities in their own right, and replicated by the reversal mode of the formative RNA against which DNA pairs itself, memes are considered to only become memes by combination with enough other ‘like’ components to make them companions introducing each other to not-so-like companions where they can leave trace amounts of their influence, without having to replicate fully each and every time. This ability to act in a variations-on-a-theme (there it is again) way, which includes denial of the theme, refinement of the theme, inclusions and exclusions in specific studies and conversations over a period of time, makes the permeation of a meme into consciousness very appealing.But does that make it any more than a cosmic joke god is playing on us – even if that god is Richard Dawkins?

Blackmore is arguing that memes are a 2nd replicator, doing in the cultural realm what genes do in terms of biology. Just as there is no consensus between scientific fields about what exactly defines a gene, so too does the concept of meme have some imprecision, as Blackmore admits. The term can refer to a concept in the mind, a PDF copy of a novel, a melody, a recipe, or a social theory, among other things. In short, a meme is any copyable instruction that can be passed from one mind to another. The appeal of memetics as discussed by Blackmore and others is that it allows us to understand cultural change with a model that does not rely on the idea of individual genius or widespread comprehension of an idea, instead showing how an idea can spread based on its ability to lodge itself in people’s minds for any number of reasons related to our biases and intuitions. So for example, religions that rely on faith over reason very effectively insulate themselves, as memes, from competing memes based in reason that might displace religious faith, because they insist that faith must take priority over untrustworthy reason. Seeing cultural evolution through a meme’s eye view, to use Blackmore’s phrase, foregrounds how little truth has to do with widely held ideas.Given the threat that this theory poses to people of religious faith, as well as humanities intellectuals unwelcoming of a scientific theory that seems to threaten pre-existing disciplines, it’s no surprise that the most liked reviews here are negative hatchet jobs full of ad hominem dismissals and mischaracterizations of Blackmore’s argument, claiming for instance that her book argues that everything is a meme, a misreading that she anticipates and tries to correct for in a section entitled “Not Everything Is a Meme.”A more credible critique of the book is that it treats memetics as a science, when in fact it is a metaphor.

262,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784353-s-hi,3,"The meme is the latest addition to that old argument about nature versus nurture. To some it is an analogy which doesn’t bear scientific investigation, for others it is the multiplier effect allowing them to expand their work and apply for research support while they consider the broader significance and potential of this idea for a range of purposes.The very fact that the person who first posited the meme is the person providing a foreword for this book, shows how memes can be constructed to be what you want them to be, and therefore what they mean. It is reiteration of both practice and of interpretation which allow memes to exist. Yoko Ono once said: “A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” By picking up each other’s conversation and spreading it through their respective communities Blackmore and Dawkins are constructing the meme of the meme. They are monitoring whether they have yet created the critical mass for it to take on a life of its own – which genes do not appear to be able to do as they are body-bound, whereas the meme can detach from any specific body, and provided there is a means of communication between it and other bodies, can appear at great distances from the initiating meme producer.This pathway is similar to the practice within neuro-linguistic programming which aids the persistence of conditions by embedding reference to them in their denial, reversal and all manner of repetitions on a theme (notice how that word is so similar to meme?). It is a magician’s trick that creates a vacuum by creating so much attention around the space within which you wish the vacuum to exist, that you can make whatever is in that space seem to disappear.This is the way to deal with opposition. Ask any politician. Denial of great enough proportions in this way can even create a black hole into which all terms other than those one wants to explore disappear from the universe. That Dawkins himself refers to pyramid schemes (oh, there’s another similar word, is there a pattern arising here that might be a hidden meme?) as being dangerous forms of memes, before rapidly correcting himself to the neutrality of memes, as the neutrality of genes, and then saying the interpretation of their meaning is up to us and the use we put them to. All of this is of course the very process he is pointing out with the meme concept to begin with. Having given a name to this thing, I can now make everything I say from this point on reflect back to that concept, and so make that concept appear real until the moment within which others take it on board and confirm my opinion which I want them to carry on my behalf. When I convince enough people to carry it in some way, then it begins to have a momentum (or should that be momentum?) in its own right, and I have birthed the proof of its reality beyond my own individual dream for its existence. I just have to get people talking about it without them begin aware where it originated. I just have to be repetitive and persistent enough that people want to deny what I am saying, and their denial becomes the reinforcer which depersonalises it from my beginning. I just have to irritate and allow the processes of conflict to permeate subconsciously in the far more effective way it operates than consciousness.It helps enormously that there is so much technology out there to support such methods.Even I am now part of it, simply because I have decided to write book reviews about everything I read, whether I find any merit in their central messages or not. I don’t have to have anymore commitment to this particular meme than any other. I merely need my own motivating force to add to the pieces others put out there for me to stumble upon and incorporate into my own flow. I take it with me, and like any virus, it spreads.Interestingly, where genes are considered to be fixed identities in their own right, and replicated by the reversal mode of the formative RNA against which DNA pairs itself, memes are considered to only become memes by combination with enough other ‘like’ components to make them companions introducing each other to not-so-like companions where they can leave trace amounts of their influence, without having to replicate fully each and every time. This ability to act in a variations-on-a-theme (there it is again) way, which includes denial of the theme, refinement of the theme, inclusions and exclusions in specific studies and conversations over a period of time, makes the permeation of a meme into consciousness very appealing.But does that make it any more than a cosmic joke god is playing on us – even if that god is Richard Dawkins? Read this book and you may be able to draw your own conclusions. Or maybe you need to avoid it to do that, and reading this book will only allow you to draw the conclusions Richard Dawkins and his colleagues have lay out for you. You decide. Or not.(did I mention scheme? No, that’s too much like a conspiracy theory…)Enjoy."

265,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19256190-todd-allen,4,"Richard Dawkins, in his book the Selfish Gene, provided a springboard—the idea of a meme—from which Susan Blackmore in her book expands upon and uses to better explain social phenomena that are otherwise seemingly intractable. Other biological curiosities unique only to humans—up to this point, as far as we know—are also expanded upon in this book and examined from a meme’s perspective. Like genes, memes have no modus operandi other than their own duplication. That their duplication is not error-free is the key component of the process that has led to the varied wonders and tragedies of the collective human experience. There is no ghost in the machine, no intentionality, no unseen being in control, directing the memes to their most ‘useful’ form. Human constructs, however much cherished, are nothing more than memeplexes cohabitating and/ or battling-it-out in an environment which contains the key ingredients required for their continued existence.I found the author’s thesis to be a palatable explanation of the variety of phenomena that have resulted from the evolution of the human mind. By applying the idea of Universal Darwinism, where the common denominators across replicating devices are fidelity, fecundity and longevity, she is able to provide a framework from a meme’s mechanistic point of view, which, like a gene’s, is based on its ability to copy itself multiple times with imperfect copies being selected for in the ever-changing contexts in which it and its predecessors came to be. Alas, it seems the ‘meme-craze’ has subsided, based on my inability to find anything current on the topic. My limited research indicated that Susan Blackmore has moved on to other endeavors unassociated with further development of the meme hypothesis."
266,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"Blackmore talks about memes. This term, that is, the ""meme"" was first coined by Richard Dawkins (in ""The Selfish Gene"" which was also a good read). It is basically any idea or behavior that can be transferred from one organism to another by imitation. Much like a gene, a meme has the properties of fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is this replicator medium that allowed for the cultural tranformation of our species. Blackmore goes into depth asserting that our minds are best understood in terms of memetic selection -- that is, a second form of natural selection. We can think of memetic selection as a second level of complexity originating from it's predecessor, the gene. Certainly the advent of human language, and most notably written language, caused a catalyst for memes to improve in terms of their fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is a great explanation for why certain religions stand the test of time as well; a combination of memes and writing systems. For example, religions that preach to others to spread the religion, to write it down, and to make it one that will reward those that follow it and punish those that don't -- it is no surprise that the especially superstitious and gullible masses of the general population in the past would be drawn to these religions, and after the myths and legends change over time (and the theology that accompanies it), we are left with believers til' this day. The meme is a powerful entity and certainly one that deserves careful investigation when discussing various topics including but not limited to: human evolution, cultural evolution, philosophy, religion, politics, etc."
267,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/311026-bill,4,"The book helped me to understand memes and to think about cultures as meme-plexes. Blackmore defines a replicator as anything that can reproduce itself with random variations. She contends that science has proven that evolution of ever more complex organisms will always result once a replicator exists.Once humans evolved the the ability to remember and communicate ideas (memes), we became replicators. the carriers of memes. The plasticity of memory and the impossibility of perfect communication provides random variation and the necessary result of the evolution of memeplexes.If her contentions are correct, viewing cultures as evolutionary super-organisms, competing for survival, becomes a helpful and illuminating perspective in my curiosity about the evolution of human nature. I have found this to as an interesting perspective to think about simple processes such as teaching fly tying, to the much more the complex, such as and how to structure my IRA, Christianity vs. Islamism, and the organizational processes among guides and members of Humanist and Unitarian groups. "
268,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5281363-xylemicarious,4,"Pretty awesome, this book introduced me to how ridiculously powerful and intuitive meme theory is, although some parts near the end started to stretch things a bit. But it does have THE best explanation I have ever heard for how and why humans got their big, complicated brains (It's a really elegant and beautiful description that I can't do much justice to here, but long story short: memes were born). And yes, in case you hadn't realized, the meme machines of the title are humans. It's a pretty friggin' interesting book, and heck, Dawkins likes it. But I don't think too many of Dawkins's writings take the meme idea to its furthest conclusions, which is what Blackmore tries to do. Like I said, it gets kind of fuzzy in some parts near the ends, but mostly her logic is impeccable. It only fails when she starts getting into the spots where the science itself is softer. Mostly forgivable in other words, and entirely worth reading if you can keep an open yet critical mind."

No I mean the concept of a second replicator in the line of genes that spread from mind to mind. Though a well researched book, and presented well, after about 75% book I lost interest. I attribute this lost of interest in the book to two things, which are more my fault that the authors. One I had just read a book about memes, 'Virus of the Mind' by Richard Brodie, before starting this book, two I have too many books on my shelf and in my Kindle I want to get to, and my interest in this subject just sort of fizzled out.

If memes are a new separate replicator, how are they different from, say, human bodies, which also replicate? Biologists would say that genes make human bodies in order to make more genes, but Blackmore didn't clearly demonstrate why memes aren't also the creation of genes for making more genes.I appreciated her discussion at the end about Self. It's an important discussion, and I think she's on the right track. I'm not sure I love her conclusion about how to live in light of the absence of self, but she's probably logically consistent there. If there's no self and no suffering, there's no enjoying. Ergo, nihilism. Food for thought."
280,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68318096-ray-ho,4,"An oldie but a goodie. This book is my first experience (and I think the first in general) introduction to the study of memetics or the idea that you are a collection of memes (aka cultural units) inherited and translated from everyone and everything around you. The whole book surrounds this basic idea with a few examples of memes (namely, religion) propagating in our and among our mind much like genes in our DNA or viruses in our cells. I'm really disappointed that memetics didn't take off much after the publishing of this book— the idea had so much potential! "

(""humans take credit for everything they invented, from language to computers"") => (""humans are kind of animal that luckily evolved in form that allows information to copy and mutate inside its brain during its lifetime!"")"
282,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12712763-matt-sautman,4,"Blackmore’s Meme Machine builds on Dawkins’s original work in interesting directions that interrogates the relationship between biology and memetics, as well as expands on memetics itself. The idea of the co-meme and memeplex both add a clarity that make dealing with memes a bit more concise, but I find Blackmore’s argument for determinism undermines some of the book’s finer points."
283,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50132012-jon,4,Having largely ignored memetics as a bit trendy I finally read this seminal work and found it hugely thought provoking and intriguing. I have a couple of the main texts she references and will be reading further I think.
284,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66679419-sam,2,Very interesting in some ways but I thought some of the material was a bit forced in it's conclusion and the use of terminology could get confusing. I didn't actually finish it though I could see making another attempt at a different time

292,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784353-s-hi,3,"The meme is the latest addition to that old argument about nature versus nurture. To some it is an analogy which doesn’t bear scientific investigation, for others it is the multiplier effect allowing them to expand their work and apply for research support while they consider the broader significance and potential of this idea for a range of purposes.The very fact that the person who first posited the meme is the person providing a foreword for this book, shows how memes can be constructed to be what you want them to be, and therefore what they mean. It is reiteration of both practice and of interpretation which allow memes to exist. Yoko Ono once said: “A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” By picking up each other’s conversation and spreading it through their respective communities Blackmore and Dawkins are constructing the meme of the meme. They are monitoring whether they have yet created the critical mass for it to take on a life of its own – which genes do not appear to be able to do as they are body-bound, whereas the meme can detach from any specific body, and provided there is a means of communication between it and other bodies, can appear at great distances from the initiating meme producer.This pathway is similar to the practice within neuro-linguistic programming which aids the persistence of conditions by embedding reference to them in their denial, reversal and all manner of repetitions on a theme (notice how that word is so similar to meme?). It is a magician’s trick that creates a vacuum by creating so much attention around the space within which you wish the vacuum to exist, that you can make whatever is in that space seem to disappear.This is the way to deal with opposition. Ask any politician. Denial of great enough proportions in this way can even create a black hole into which all terms other than those one wants to explore disappear from the universe. That Dawkins himself refers to pyramid schemes (oh, there’s another similar word, is there a pattern arising here that might be a hidden meme?) as being dangerous forms of memes, before rapidly correcting himself to the neutrality of memes, as the neutrality of genes, and then saying the interpretation of their meaning is up to us and the use we put them to. All of this is of course the very process he is pointing out with the meme concept to begin with. Having given a name to this thing, I can now make everything I say from this point on reflect back to that concept, and so make that concept appear real until the moment within which others take it on board and confirm my opinion which I want them to carry on my behalf. When I convince enough people to carry it in some way, then it begins to have a momentum (or should that be momentum?) in its own right, and I have birthed the proof of its reality beyond my own individual dream for its existence. I just have to get people talking about it without them begin aware where it originated. I just have to be repetitive and persistent enough that people want to deny what I am saying, and their denial becomes the reinforcer which depersonalises it from my beginning. I just have to irritate and allow the processes of conflict to permeate subconsciously in the far more effective way it operates than consciousness.It helps enormously that there is so much technology out there to support such methods.Even I am now part of it, simply because I have decided to write book reviews about everything I read, whether I find any merit in their central messages or not. I don’t have to have anymore commitment to this particular meme than any other. I merely need my own motivating force to add to the pieces others put out there for me to stumble upon and incorporate into my own flow. I take it with me, and like any virus, it spreads.Interestingly, where genes are considered to be fixed identities in their own right, and replicated by the reversal mode of the formative RNA against which DNA pairs itself, memes are considered to only become memes by combination with enough other ‘like’ components to make them companions introducing each other to not-so-like companions where they can leave trace amounts of their influence, without having to replicate fully each and every time. This ability to act in a variations-on-a-theme (there it is again) way, which includes denial of the theme, refinement of the theme, inclusions and exclusions in specific studies and conversations over a period of time, makes the permeation of a meme into consciousness very appealing.But does that make it any more than a cosmic joke god is playing on us – even if that god is Richard Dawkins? Read this book and you may be able to draw your own conclusions. Or maybe you need to avoid it to do that, and reading this book will only allow you to draw the conclusions Richard Dawkins and his colleagues have lay out for you. You decide. Or not.(did I mention scheme? No, that’s too much like a conspiracy theory…)Enjoy."

295,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19256190-todd-allen,4,"Richard Dawkins, in his book the Selfish Gene, provided a springboard—the idea of a meme—from which Susan Blackmore in her book expands upon and uses to better explain social phenomena that are otherwise seemingly intractable. Other biological curiosities unique only to humans—up to this point, as far as we know—are also expanded upon in this book and examined from a meme’s perspective. Like genes, memes have no modus operandi other than their own duplication. That their duplication is not error-free is the key component of the process that has led to the varied wonders and tragedies of the collective human experience. There is no ghost in the machine, no intentionality, no unseen being in control, directing the memes to their most ‘useful’ form. Human constructs, however much cherished, are nothing more than memeplexes cohabitating and/ or battling-it-out in an environment which contains the key ingredients required for their continued existence.I found the author’s thesis to be a palatable explanation of the variety of phenomena that have resulted from the evolution of the human mind. By applying the idea of Universal Darwinism, where the common denominators across replicating devices are fidelity, fecundity and longevity, she is able to provide a framework from a meme’s mechanistic point of view, which, like a gene’s, is based on its ability to copy itself multiple times with imperfect copies being selected for in the ever-changing contexts in which it and its predecessors came to be. Alas, it seems the ‘meme-craze’ has subsided, based on my inability to find anything current on the topic. My limited research indicated that Susan Blackmore has moved on to other endeavors unassociated with further development of the meme hypothesis."
296,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"Blackmore talks about memes. This term, that is, the ""meme"" was first coined by Richard Dawkins (in ""The Selfish Gene"" which was also a good read). It is basically any idea or behavior that can be transferred from one organism to another by imitation. Much like a gene, a meme has the properties of fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is this replicator medium that allowed for the cultural tranformation of our species. Blackmore goes into depth asserting that our minds are best understood in terms of memetic selection -- that is, a second form of natural selection. We can think of memetic selection as a second level of complexity originating from it's predecessor, the gene. Certainly the advent of human language, and most notably written language, caused a catalyst for memes to improve in terms of their fecundity, fidelity, and longevity. It is a great explanation for why certain religions stand the test of time as well; a combination of memes and writing systems. For example, religions that preach to others to spread the religion, to write it down, and to make it one that will reward those that follow it and punish those that don't -- it is no surprise that the especially superstitious and gullible masses of the general population in the past would be drawn to these religions, and after the myths and legends change over time (and the theology that accompanies it), we are left with believers til' this day. The meme is a powerful entity and certainly one that deserves careful investigation when discussing various topics including but not limited to: human evolution, cultural evolution, philosophy, religion, politics, etc."
297,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/311026-bill,4,"The book helped me to understand memes and to think about cultures as meme-plexes. Blackmore defines a replicator as anything that can reproduce itself with random variations. She contends that science has proven that evolution of ever more complex organisms will always result once a replicator exists.Once humans evolved the the ability to remember and communicate ideas (memes), we became replicators. the carriers of memes. The plasticity of memory and the impossibility of perfect communication provides random variation and the necessary result of the evolution of memeplexes.If her contentions are correct, viewing cultures as evolutionary super-organisms, competing for survival, becomes a helpful and illuminating perspective in my curiosity about the evolution of human nature. I have found this to as an interesting perspective to think about simple processes such as teaching fly tying, to the much more the complex, such as and how to structure my IRA, Christianity vs. Islamism, and the organizational processes among guides and members of Humanist and Unitarian groups. "
298,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5281363-xylemicarious,4,"Pretty awesome, this book introduced me to how ridiculously powerful and intuitive meme theory is, although some parts near the end started to stretch things a bit. But it does have THE best explanation I have ever heard for how and why humans got their big, complicated brains (It's a really elegant and beautiful description that I can't do much justice to here, but long story short: memes were born). And yes, in case you hadn't realized, the meme machines of the title are humans. It's a pretty friggin' interesting book, and heck, Dawkins likes it. But I don't think too many of Dawkins's writings take the meme idea to its furthest conclusions, which is what Blackmore tries to do. Like I said, it gets kind of fuzzy in some parts near the ends, but mostly her logic is impeccable. It only fails when she starts getting into the spots where the science itself is softer. Mostly forgivable in other words, and entirely worth reading if you can keep an open yet critical mind."
299,019286212X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22814039-david-pratt,3,"This book I bought about 5 years ago after it was referenced in another book a number of times as being a great study of the concept of memes. Now when I say memes I don't mean adorable picture of Grumpy Cat with clever little phrases, or photo's of Marilyn Monroe quoting stating some of the most narcissistic phrases I ever seen and treating her like some great philosopher. No I mean the concept of a second replicator in the line of genes that spread from mind to mind. Though a well researched book, and presented well, after about 75% book I lost interest. I attribute this lost of interest in the book to two things, which are more my fault that the authors. One I had just read a book about memes, 'Virus of the Mind' by Richard Brodie, before starting this book, two I have too many books on my shelf and in my Kindle I want to get to, and my interest in this subject just sort of fizzled out. Perhaps sometime in the future I will get around to finishing this book."
