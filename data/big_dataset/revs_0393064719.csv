0,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"I found this book very good at explaining Feynman’s contributions to physics from the context of the history of the science and ideas. It was a great complement to Glieck’s wonderful “Genius”, a biography which focused on the special qualities of his mind and personality. Krauss is a physicist himself, so the advantage here is his ability to convey the science as much as possible (without resorting to equations), and in the process he elucidates the paradoxical blend of individual genius, collaboration, and competition that drives progress. I came away with a deep respect for how Feymann’s ideas fueled not only his own successes with a theory of the electromagenetic force but seminal influences on work of others on all the other fundamental forces (strong and weak nuclear forces and gravity). Also, I understand better his pioneering work on superfluidity (which led to big advances by others in superconducters), foundational thinking about nanotechnology, and advances in computations science and prospects for quantum computing. Like many ordinary citizens of the world, there is only so far I can get toward truly understanding the science of quantum physics. I was a biology major required to take physics in college in the 70’s, and I struggled through with a C in a standard intro course. But for a make-up class, I wrangled permission to take an intro to quantum mechanics and somehow took to it enough to garner an ”A”. I succeeded in imbibing the basics accepted at that time for accounting for the electromagnetic force and the yawning gap in attaining Einstein’s dream of a unified theory encompassing the other forces with a coherent scheme. I admired the innovation of “Feynmann diagram” which allowed one to visualize an interaction between particles in collision with tracking of exchange of photons to mediate the forces leading to changes in trajectories before and after. His diagrams combined with his path integral approach was seen by Feynmann as mathematical tricks that served to bypass (“normalize”) a lot of infinities that Dirac discovered as spoiling the success of the Copenhagen school model when one applies probability wave descriptions to situations beyond a simple hydrogen atom hanging out (in my dim understanding). But Krauss seems to favor the school of thought that the tools themselves, once found to be essential for the theories of the weak and strong nuclear forces, somehow represent a fundamental theoretical capturing of how reality works.  Simplest Feynmann diagram showing a collision between two particles, p, with exchange of momentum k mediated by a photon indicated with a dotted line The picture that Krauss paints reveals Feynmann as quite collegial in many ways and driven more by the common enterprise of finding principles than in seeking selfish glory and ownership of original ideas. Yet he was also quite a loner and driven by a form of hubris that didn’t trust the work of others unless he could derive their advances in his own way. He often neglected advances with other approaches that might have helped his own progress. By the time he was 15 he had taught himself most branches of mathematics and his own ways of deriving proofs. He is famous for applying so-called path integrals as a mathematical approach to handling all the probability wave dynamics between one point and another, which proved essential for a Nobel-winning breakthrough in the quantum model for the electromagnetic force known as quantum electrodynamics. Krauss cites an early kernel of his methods in his high school fascination with the calculus innovations of Lagrange and Hamilton for describing pathways of motion based on accounting for continual interplay of potential and kinetic energy. Where I fail in confidence is in my understanding of the status of virtual particles and the energy inherent in a vacuum. Feynmann’s modeling made use of brief creation of particle pairs such as a photon and anti-photon, which could then annihilate each other with no violation of conservation laws. The virtual particles can have negative energy, and mathematically an antimatter particle can sometimes be described as like its counterpart running backward in time. What I can grasp is like Dirac’s prediction of antimatter and its confirmation by experiment, the application of quantum probability treatment to the nuclear forces by Feynmann’s Caltech colleague Gell-Mann predicted a host of particles similarly confirmed in high-energy collider studies. There were a couple of decades where there was a zoo of particles being predicted and discovered, and it all seemed mad. The solution of multiple quarks with properties of charm, color, and spin I now just shake my head over in dumb amazement. The final count I read in Wiki is 61, all elegantly systematized. The take home message I can manage is all forces are conceived as mediation by the quantized energy packets/particles, photons for the electromagnetic force, gluons for the strong nuclear force, and quarks for the weak force now integrated with electromagnetic as a unified electroweak force. Feynmann had his own scheme called partons, but he ultimately acknowledged Gell-Mann’s conception of quarks as more comprehensive. He dabbled with parallel quantum field representations of gravity mediated by gravitrons, but no clue to how to experimentally prove of their existence has been developed yet. The book integrates coverage of his personal development, including his wives, his womanizing, his affinity for drumming, his humor, and his dedication to teaching. But such delving is not a strength of this book. The Glieck biography and his own memoirs (e.g. “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynmann”) are more satisfying in that regard. If you feel ready to be walked through a lot of physics without the challenge of equations (and thus without hope of attaining a deep appreciation of the subject), or have any interest in how science evolves from individual and collaborative achievements, then I bet you can gain more from this read than you might expect.   "
1,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,4,"This is a really good book but I can see why it got so many relatively poor reviews. Krauss explains Feynmann's work very well, and provides an arresting and insightful account of how his thinking developed over the decades. But it is about physics, not just the man and those aspects of Feynmann's life that made him an internationally-recognized name. I heard Feynmann lecture a couple of times myself and it's true, he was as dynamic and awe-inspiring as Krauss makes clear; on the other hand I have to admit I didn't fully understand the lectures either. But it is such a joy to read a biography that isn't written by a popularizer who doesn't understand the subject matter enough to be other than an uncritical booster, that it really is worth the effort to read this bio."
2,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8444272-carl-rollyson,3,"Nearly anyone writing about Richard Feynman is bound to seem staid compared with the man himself. The physicist, who won a Nobel Prize for explaining the interaction between electrons and protons in terms of quantum mechanics, was among the century's most celebrated popularizers of scientific thinking. His public talks were transformed into entertaining books like ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" (1985), and he was known for stunningly simple explanations, such as when he explained the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger using a glass of ice water and one of the rocket booster's defective carbon o-rings. He was also famous for his quirky interests outside of physics—dancing, drawing, bongo playing, a devotion to strip clubs.Lawrence M. Krauss is a physicist, and ""Quantum Man"" is part of a series dedicated to lives in science, meaning that much of the book consists of technical explanations that will be challenging for general readers. Mr. Krauss often seems to be addressing physics students. While it is undoubtedly important for readers to grasp Feynman's scientific work, Mr. Krauss rarely uses the sort of crystal-clear language with which Feynman himself used to enlighten listeners. Here, for example, is Feynman's introduction to physics for undergraduate students as recorded in the ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics: The New Millennium Edition"" (2010):""If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.It would be misleading to imply that Feynman's lectures are always as lucid as his one-sentence definition of the atomic hypothesis. But in many cases Mr. Krauss could have simply availed himself of his subject's own words.Furthermore, even in a biography devoted to a man of science, the man has to emerge in situ, and such is rarely the case in Mr. Krauss's book. Perhaps because so much has already been written by and about Feynman, Mr. Krauss takes his subject's personality for granted. As Feynman himself liked to counsel young scientists: Never rely on the experiments of others. A biographer of Feynman should approach this most unusual genius by doing something fresh.Mr. Krauss certainly finds room to discuss Feynman's offbeat personality, but he refuses to speculate on how it might have influenced his science. To be sure, Feynman disparaged the notion that his interests outside of science had anything to do with his physics. But such denial should serve to challenge the biographer: Feynman never worried about looking like a fool—as he said countless times to anyone who would listen—and neither should his biographer.Take Feynman's desire to understand how electrons can behave as particles, as waves and as both, all at the same time—and can even be in two different places at once. Such behavior is not possible according to classical physics, but quantum mechanics suggest that it is. Feynman may have understood such logic—at least in part—because he retained a child-like quality, a sense of play, throughout his life. In a child's world you can be here and elsewhere at the same time—in Kansas and with the Wizard of Oz.Linkages of these sorts can in fact be forged by reading Mr. Krauss alongside Feynman's own posthumous publications, such as ""The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist"" (1998) and ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"" (1999), in which Feynman discourses about himself and his intellectual adventures. Usually the biographer serves as a kind of check on a subject like Feynman, who, it is presumed, mythologized himself as most autobiographers do. But in this curious case, Feynman has to be consulted to make sense of his biographer's narrative.James Gleick's ""Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman"" (1992) is a more supple treatment of the same basic material. To pick just one example, Mr. Krauss does not mention until page 210 that Feynman's sister, Joan, was also a physicist, while from Mr. Gleick we learn that she served as his lab assistant early in his career. Even so, neither volume quite gives readers the sense that they have penetrated beneath the flamboyant physicist's public pose—if that's what it was. Could Feynman really have been as genial and entertaining a fellow as he seemed? After all, Mr. Gleick notes that many of the justly famous Feynman sayings that seemed so spontaneous in his lectures and interviews were in fact labored over in private.Yet consulting his selected letters, ""Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track"" (2005), reveals the same amusing, shrewd character, evident on every page. This correspondence demonstrates that Feynman was not only a great monologist but a good teacher and interlocutor. One of the best letters is Feynman's reply to a publisher complaining that physics professors were selling complimentary copies of textbooks sent to them. Feynman argues that the very sending of the books accomplishes the publisher's purpose: advertising his wares. If the re-selling of promotional copies prevented the publisher from making a decent profit, Feynman advised, he should stop sending them. As for himself, Feynman concluded, he returned unsolicited books—but now, come to think of it, the publisher had given him a new idea about what to do with them.Besides entertaining himself, why would Feynman spend so much time on such trivial correspondence? (The letter to the publisher is by no means atypical.) This question Mr. Krauss, for one, never asks. When he observes behavior in Feynman that he does not understand, he simply calls it ""paradoxical."" Perhaps the point about Feynman's character that this reveals is that nothing—at least potentially—was beneath his notice. Just as Feynman wanted to explore the constituents of the atom, he wanted to fathom other minds and would happily engage, say, a member of the John Birch Society in a discussion of the U. S. Constitution rather than simply dismiss extremist views—or even ridiculous ones. There is a lesson there about curiosity that his biographers would do well to heed."
3,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3339429-louise-silk,4,"I was not at all familiar with Richard Feynman until reading this very down-to-earth understandable biography that brings out the essence of a true scientific genius in the league of Einstein.Krauss details Feynman's scientific contributions, their relevance, importance and uniqueness in fairly easy to understand layman's terms. He also delves into Feynman's more publicly known activities, including his bongo playing, nude painting and his famous demonstration of the failure of the O-rings in the Challenger space shuttle disaster. Feynman's great influence on physics was not just the direct impact of his original ideas but also his compulsive need to work out everything from first principles, understanding it inside out, backwards and forwards and from as many different angles as possible-to think outside the box. He insisted on honesty and truth in science, reporting the negative as well as the positive results.Richard Feynman was a scientist with striking intellectual originality that allowed him to look at the physical world in wholly unanticipated new ways. The biography does a good job of demonstrating that true success needs fearless determination and an unwavering belief in truth."

5,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"As in other accounts, Feynman as a person is interesting. In this account of Feynman's life, Krauss does a good job. Krauss lost me quickly, however, in his discussion of Feynman's quantum physics. Acknowledging that particle physics is a tough nut to crack, this is not a book, perhaps, for the general reader. The best part of this book was toward the end when Krauss describes Feynman's attempt to seam particle physics with gravitation and general relativity, which Feynman called a quantum theory of gravitation. Krauss notes that while general relativity had become “an entirely self-contained field that could be understood apart from almost all of the rest of physics,” Feynman “rightly believed such a separation was artificial.” With gravitational waves, Feynman believed that “general relativity is not that different from the theories describing the other forces of nature. It can be described by the exchange of fundamental particles just like the rest.” The discussion of Feynman's “quantum cosmology” where the universe is viewed as operating via quantum mechanics was difficult to follow, but was tantalizing, as was the discussion and statement that “the total energy of the entire universe might be precisely zero.” Boiled down, is the cosmos about energy differentials and balance?"
6,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849793-richard,4,"A very good book about Feynman that complements other biographies of him by focusing almost completely on the actual science. Krauss is skilled at explaining that science for the lay reader, but I suspect this book works much better as a reading experience. I was trying it as an audio book, and I think that was a mistake. I found myself having to go back a lot as I kept missing details and losing the thread.This is definitely a book I'll revisit as a print/e-book, though. I would recommend others try it that way, and give the audio book a pass."
7,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53012616-manish-pandey,5,"A beautiful read. A legend. Richard Feynman. This guy was seldom satisfied by those bookish, readymade conventional approaches which many people would just take for granted and rather skip or just graze through them, Feynman invented his own methods to understand those concepts as deep and as fine as he could! He somehow worked out his own unique methods to understand the secrets of Nature ! Awesome human being. A great teacher! Reading his works is always a beautiful experience for me. Truly elegant!"
8,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,5,"I enjoyed reading this book. I had already read the very good biography of Feynman, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman, but some time ago. This book goes into Feynman's physics in more detail, and with more context, than ""Genius"", which, from my perspective as a Ph.D. in Physics and one who has read fairly widely about Physics since retiring from a job that took me away from Physics for more than 30 years, is a good thing. However, I can understand how some others with less of a physics background might have found this a little tough going (although I don't think the book contains a single equation).When I was an undergraduate in Physics, one of the recommended books was Feynman's classic The Feynman Lectures on Physics, which I found quite readable. Interestingly, it was never an assigned book in any of our courses. The more I learned about Feynman, the more interesting a character he became in my mind. In fact, when I applied to graduate schools, I wrote to him in the hope that I could become one of his graduate students (ah, the innocence of a callow youth!). Therein lies another story that I won't bore you with in this review. Suffice it to say that Feynman was then, and still is, a hero of mine.In the intervening years I have learned more about Feynman, and have come to the conclusion that I probably would not have enjoyed being one of his graduate students, because I would not have been of sufficient caliber, and because he was not known for his support of graduate students.This book gave a little more insight to his non-conformist genius, and made me aware of how influential he was in so many areas other than those for which he was awarded his Nobel Prize. I knew he had been in at the very beginning of nanotechnology, and this book filled in some of those details.Overall, I highly recommend this book, as long as you are prepared to read and try to understand the physics parts."
9,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56395-jason,3,"This book is an interesting combination of biography and introductory physics. The life of Richard Feynman is intertwined with discussions of physics. While it might make for slow going for some, I quickly came to see that, to understand Feynman's life and work, one needs to have even a minor grasp upon and understanding of the questions with which he grappled throughout his life. Krauss does a fairly good job of keeping the physics at the level of the general reader, though I thought there were times where the discussion became bogged down in details and asides.I have not read other biographies of Feynman, so I cannot comment on how this compares to them. As a basic introduction to Feynman and the physics questions of the twentieth century, it's pretty decent."
10,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45360-nick,4,"This is not a full biography, but rather one that attempts to explain, for non-physicists, just why Richard Feynman was and is one of the most important scientists of the twentieth century. Krauss succeeds admirably in assessing Feynman's importance and his outsize influence on physical science which has endured for several decades after his death. Krauss argues convincingly that Feynman's importance will continue to grow as our knowledge of physics grows. "
11,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2546497-m,3,"This book is about theoretical physicist Richard Feynman and is written by Lawrence Krauss, who is also a theoretical physicist. Krauss says his book is ""accessible,"" but I strongly disagree. To me accessible means that the content could be read by a lot of different people and still be appreciated. I think that even people who are knowledgeable in physics would have trouble following this book. I listened as a an audio book, which probably made it even harder to follow. The central focus of the book is Feynman's major scientific achievements and the processes by which he arrived at his conclusions (or lack thereof). It also talks a little bit about his personal life, his work on the Manhattan Project and his interactions with others in the scientific community. But mostly the book returns again and again (I think) to Feynman's attempt to remove the infinities from an equation that describes the number of possible pathways that an electron can take between point A and B. This is called the sum-over-paths equation (or the path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics). If you don't know what this is, this book might not be too fun for you. Despite some training in physics, much of the book was incomprehensible to me. But what I did find interesting was Feynman's admirable tenacity to chase down an idea. You learn a lot about the scientific process, competition, politics and drama in academia. But what might be most important is just to remember that there are many ways to go from point A to B, we just don't know if that number is infinite or finite, yet. Or maybe we do know. I don't know. If you are interested in a book about Richard Feynman that is accessible, I would suggest, ""Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman"" that Feynman wrote himself and is highly accessible. "
12,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,2,"I really really wanted to like this book, as I've been wanting to get back into the swing of science reading. But Lawrence Krauss lost me on two counts.First, the physics easily makes up 60% of the book, and dives in pretty deep. I appreciate that the Krauss is trying to give equal focus to Feynman's science and his larger-than-life personality, but I got lost pretty quick, and gave up 60 pages in when I realised that I was skimming the science searching for the next bit of bio. It certainly understood more than I would have two years ago, but it wasn't what I was reading for and I got a bit thrown by that. Second, Krauss overdoes the exclamation mark. Your average biography, to my mind, shouldn't use exclamation marks outside of quoted dialogue, and your average science book should also employ them warily. And sentences like this are simply not improved through their inclusion:But unlike conventional repairmen, Feynman would delight in solving radio problems not merely by tinkering, but by thinking!Needless to say, when the experimenters involved in the claimed discovery went back to their device and looked at it there was the bolt!Those two examples were on pages 4 and 5. I don't know why it grates on me so badly, but it does.If you physics is stronger and your aversion to !!! weaker than mine, you might get a lot more out of 'Quantum Man' than I did. But I'm going back to James Gleick's canonical biography myself. "
13,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37909234-tom-richards,4,"'Genius' by James Gleick is probably the more comprehensive picture of Feynman the man, giving more colour about his childhood and his motivations, as well as more stories showing Feynman the iconoclast and practical joker. 'Quantum man' is nevertheless a valuable complement to the other Feynman literature, because it tells us more about Feynman the physicist. Going through Feynman's original papers, Krauss puts them in their historical context, showing what was novel about his approach. He often shows how ideas that Feynman introduced radically changed the fields he introduced them to, even if he didn't take them all the way to their often nobel-prize-winning conclusions. It was almost as if he was giving the other physicists a chance by not keeping up with the current literature, preferring to figure things out by himself. Apparently, he even nearly missed his own Nobel by being lackadaisical about publishing, and only the efforts of Freeman Dyson in evangelising his work and forcing him to write a paper allowed the world to recognise the value of his 'sum-over-histories' approach. But for him, it wasn't about the accolades or getting priority for his discoveries. As the title of yet another book about Feynman implies, for him it was 'the pleasure of finding things out'."
14,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,3,"Hard for me to rate this because I don't have many comparatives in the Physics Biography genre, but this is not just a Feynman biography. It's an overview of Quantum theory, the last 100 years of Physics, and the major players in the field. Writing for the layperson, Krauss has the expressed intention of helping the reader understand why Richard Feynman was so important and revered in science. In order to do that, he goes fairly deep into the last century of Physics and the dive the science took into Quantum theory. I struggled with this, even while knowing he was giving the most accessible overview he could (and I knew a little about most of it already). Quantum theory is rough going, since practically all the laws are in direct contradiction to how we observe our daily reality, and it's dizzying to imagine the quantum rules - they are very strange, even while they underpin our entire physical world.Besides that difficulty with the details, this book is an excellent play by play of the developments and major discoveries in Physics, and well-drawn sketches of the major players in the field, woven into Feynman's career and his many contributions during his life, as he collaborated, co-discovered, and influenced many other scientists throughout his life."

I really loved ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"" and Krauss's biography of him from the point of view of his research in physics is especially interesting reading if you like popular science.Although the concepts are sometimes hard to grasp, they are explained very well. Quantum theory is, in itself, very hard to grasp, after all. Krauss's use of Feynman's analogies really helps, though, and where necessary Krauss uses his own.The interspersal of Feynman's scientific work with anecdotes and information about his personal life adds a human dimension to the story. I had heard he was a genius. This book taught me about his influences and his vices. The story of Feynman and his first wife, Arline, is particularly touching."
17,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3632411-jesus,5,"This is a ""science biography"", that explains what Feynman studied along his life. So requires some interest in particle physics to read it. I was amazed to discover how he had started so many new fields, then continued and completed by others. Also surprising is his lack of credit-greed, his will to help others in their researches (even while facing cancer), and above all his unquenching curiosity. This curiosity made him go to all seminars (what amazed students) and even to use in his walks always a different path to see new things... WAIT!, so he was also using the ""sum over all possible paths"" while walking to work . :-) Amazing man."
18,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,4,Krauss proves that being well versed in the profession of one's bio subject makes a big difference. He was able to explain the nuances as he offered a history of quantum mechanics while tying it to the life and work of Richard Feynman. Krauss emphasized how and also why Feynman loved to arrive at a scientific conclusion on his own and preferably via his own path. A book like this presents the author with the challenge of how much detail to present and for me Krauss went with better to present too much than not enough and I'm glad he did. 
19,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20128083-lisa-houlihan,0,I'm not going to listen to any subsequent books Krauss narrates. His enunciation is slipshod and his cadence is off. His pauses are Kirk-Shatner-ly long and deliberate and they occur at unnatural places in the sentences.

Be that as it may, it is important to mention that his contributions don't resume to quantum electrodynamics alone, fact that is depicted rigurously among the pages of the book. However, if you're looking forward to reading this, a scientific background would be preferable as some notions can be tricky to understand. On the other hand, if Mr. Feynman's life sparks your interest, the descriptions are accurate and 'tasty' in a way. All in all, it is quite an interesting insight into the life of one of the most influential physicists ever known, but it doesn't stop just there - the book manages to become the epitome of the state of the quantum mechanics from the last century."

24,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,4,"A fantastic biography of Feynman's scientific accomplishments, but it glosses over the other aspects of his life. While the book hits the science great, I found Feynman's own autobiographical accounts a more compelling narrative of his life and gave a better sense for him as a man.ProsGreat biography of one of the most interesting and influence physicists of the twentieth century.Physics is fairly accessible to the reader with just a basic science background.ConsPersonal details are glossed over, focusing almost exclusively on Feynman's scientific significance.Some science background will help to follow some of the more esoteric concepts.DescriptionPublished March 2011.350 pages, 17 chapters + Introduction, Epilogue, Acknowledgements/Sources, & IndexAlso available in audiobook format.Guide Review - Quantum ManLawrence Krauss does a great job of presenting scientific ideas for a lay audience. In this latest effort, he turns these skills toward writing a fantastic biography of Richard P. Feynman, one of the most important and entertaining physicists of the twentieth century, using his life as a prism to explore the creation of the atomic bomb, the development of quantum electrodynamics, and the early days of string theory.One of the difficulties in tackling a biography of Feynman is that he spent his life doing a superb job of writing his own autobiographies, sharing personal anecdotes about his life through books like Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman and What Do You Care What Other People Think?With this being the case, Krauss makes the intriguing decision to avoid most of these interesting anecdotes entirely. There's a passing mention, for example, of his propensity for lock picking, including cracking top-secret safes at the Los Alamos facility during the Manhattan Project. His role in investigating the Challenger disaster is similarly drawn into the background.No, Krauss instead tailors his narrative of Feynman's life around, as the subtitle suggests, ""Feynman's life in science."" The personality comes through, but with the emphasis entirely on how that personality reflects his scientific thinking.Still, with Feynman there's more than enough material to keep this tactic engaging. Feynman's playful demeanor helped establish a scientific methodology in which he focused only on the problems that he found interesting, which in the case of someone as brilliant as Feynman led to some of the most insightful concepts in modern physics. He not only helped illuminate the underlying principles needed to finalize quantum electrodynamics, but also foresaw the fields of nanotechnology and quantum computers decades before they were feasible forms of technology.The only problem with this book is that, as a biography, it does fall short in some areas. There's a complete picture of Richard Feynman the Scientist, but Richard Feynman the Man is lost in the story. Some might argue that this distinction didn't really apply to Feynman, but I don't think Krauss really justifies such a stance in the book. As great as Feynman's contributions to science, a life is about relationships and experiences more than scientific ideas, and these are the elements that are most missing from Quantum Man.If you want to understand Feynman's science, then Quantum Man is a great place to look. If you want to understand Feynman's life, then look elsewhere.(Review from ""http://physics.about.com/od/feynmanbo..."")"
25,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8396455-john-orman,5,"An outstanding entry in the Great Discoveries Series, this wonderful book describes the inquisitive spirit of the brilliant scientist Richard P. Feynman, who refuses to abide by what is fashionable in physics research. Like the author Lawrence Krauss, I bought the Feynman Lectures on Physics when I first entered college, though unlike Krauss, I actually had a full two years of classes that used the books. I loved those very challenging courses, though Krauss notes that in colleges nationwide, the actual course met with ""mixed success."" The texts were ""too demanding for the average physics class, and too revolutionary."" I was surprised to learn that Feynman earned nothing from the books, as all royalties went to CalTech.Quantum Man is full of wonderful Feynman quotes, such as:""Reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.""""Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show.""Feynman's attributes included showmanship, concentration, and energy, but the ability that sent him so far into the pantheon of modern science was his unparalleled talent in mathematics. Then his intuition would cause him to explore ideas from a different perspective.As a freshman at MIT, his majors went from math (not practical) to electrical engineering (too practical) to physics (""just right"").Historian Sylvan Schweber wrote of Feynman: ""His versatility was legendary. His genius at lockpicking, repairing calculators, assembling IBM machines, solving puzzles and difficult physics problems earned him admiration from the best minds of the 20th century.""Toward the very end of his life, Feynman made quite a public show of demonstrating how the O-ring failure at low temperatures could have caused the Challenger space shuttle tragedy. This very detailed book describes the public triumphs as well as the personal traits and tragedies of a scientific giant who was always thrilled by the wonder of it all."
26,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4212856-craig-robertson,3,"Feynman was a fascinating fellow, so I was very interested to dig-deeper into his life. I felt a biography written by an accomplished physicist was an ideal choice, as the author could hold my hand in leading me through the depths of quantum physics. This is why I chose this biography of Feynman.How did my hunch turn out? Okay. After finishing the book, I felt I knew Richard Feynman and his personality fairly well. Mr. Krauss's writing is straight-forward and approachable. The author makes significant effort to explain to the novice what the science was and why it mattered. In this regard, Mr. Krauss did okay, but not fabulously. I was an applied physics major, so I was familiar with a lot of the technical stuff to begin with. The problem I have with Mr Krauss's scientific explications was that if I did not know a good deal, I would have been lost at times. He went into the science too deeply for a novice to follow.My biggest problem with the book can be summed-up in one word: EDITING. Were Mr. Krauss to have invested in a journeyman editor, the final produce would have been much better. He penned way too many uber-long sentences. Also, Mr. Krauss employed far too many pronouns in place of proper names. Finally, a quality editor would have corrected the author's tendency to whip-saw through Feynman's life. Sequentially we go back and forth, youth to Nobel Prize, marriage to widowhood, extensively. A little too Slautherhouse Five for a work of non-fiction.At the end of the day, I do now know enough about Feynman to not need to read another biography, so Mr Krauss did an adequate enough job. Would I recommend you read this particular book to learn about Feynman? I cannot say. I guess I would leave it at look around a bit to see if there is a clearly superior version, and, failing finding one, this book will do. "
27,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13908841-john-grange,4,"Previously, I was unaware of this particular Feynman biography having only read the venerable 1993 work by James Gleick. To my surprise, there not only was a Feynman biography that heretofore was unknown to me, but it was written by the Lawrence Krauss, a brilliant physicist in his own right. Mr. Krauss didn't retread much ground with Quantum Man. While Mr. Gleick's biography wonderfully characterized the life and times of the man that was Richard Feynman, Quantum Man explored Richard Feynman's outsized impact on science with a depth, richness, and accessibility that only a fellow scientist and teacher could muster.Quantum Man was technical in many respects, not holding back on any esoterica that may assist in understanding the astounding impact of Feynman's work in so many fields. But in other regards it was remarkably accessible, utilizing thoughtful pacing and uncomplicated prose garnished with simple explanations of complicated things, to rocket the lay reader into Feynman's complex world of particle physics.This book was a joy to read from start to finish, yet I must say that the epilogue happened to stick out in my mind - that it was the last thing I read in the book notwithstanding. Including some additional anecdotes that didn't make it into the book was a perfect conclusion to an edifying journey and it so vividly drove home the core message of the book - that Feynman was utterly special in every way and it's that uniqueness, from the way he thought to his mannerisms, all contribute to the legend of one of the most impactful minds to grace planet Earth, Richard P. Feynman."
28,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,1,"I really wanted to like Richard Krauss’s book Quantum Man, a biography of Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman. I’ve seen Krauss on several on-line videos and have heard him speak on NPR, and he is always interesting and engaging. Unfortunately, I found this book immensely dull and a real chore to plow through. Here’s what I believe is the crux of the problem, and this criticism is not limited to Krauss, but to scientists in general ... most scientists do not have the skill set needed to communicate with the general public. Need proof? Just look at the science of evolution or global climate change. Even with all of the evidence in their favor, they still cannot convince 40% and 50% of the population respectively. It is a logical fallacy to assume that, because someone has a high degree of competency in one area (science) that they have skills in another (journalism). The reality is that it is quite rare for someone to be very good at more than one specialty. My experience has been that, in general, scientists do not make great authors. Although there are a few exceptions: Carl Sagan, E.O. Wilson and Jared Diamond to name a few, many more are rather hopeless. Scientist-authors simply do not seem to understand how to create a compelling narrative, how to draw the reader into a story, or how to make a story line interesting so that it builds on itself to reveal a broader truth. Krauss is certainly sorely lacking in each of these skills and Quantum Man suffers from all of these flaws. "
29,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"This is the fourth Feynman biography I've consumed and by far the most science-focused of the lot which is both good and bad. Unlike other books, Krauss does a magnificent job stitching Feynman into the tapestry of science and presenting him as scientist and then man but at the cost of making all the notions of him as a person seeming to be tacked on and making him sound a bit more prophetic than I think is appropriate.Throughout the book, Krauss mentions cases where Feynman says ""this will be important"" or ""we should look here"" or ""hey, look at this technique"" and then following up with all the cases where those predictions were true. I don't recall any cases where the author says ""hey, he missed here"" or ""this was a blind alley"". While it may be the case that he was perfectly oracular, I don't believe even Feynman was THAT good. I've also read a lot of Krauss's other books and I think he again moves far too fast in some places for the reader and is quick to use technical jargon after a single use. There are no polite reminders of what things mean and there are gentle simplifications when technical works come up. I don't consider myself a slouch in keeping track of particle physics, but I got lost a number of times even when the material wasn't new to me.If you're looking for a 3rd Feynman book, read this, but only after James G.'s Genius and Feynman's autobiography. One does a better job of explaining the mind, the other the man, but both create a human picture in a way this biography doesn' try to and sadly doesn't achieve."
30,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7816047-aphelion,4,"I was a bit apprehensive it would just be a retread of all the old stories from Surely You're Joking and What Do You Care. However I was actually very pleasantly surprised. The book focuses on the science, and in particular on how Feynman's work has influenced current thinking on a variety of subjects. One can make a reasonable argument that this book is about Feynman only as a gimmick, just to have an interesting discussion about current physics from a historical perspective. That's accomplished easily enough; Feynman's interests in science were so broad after all that he touched on just about everything. In particular, he really was one of the first (though not the only one) to take a serious interest in studying the theoretical properties of gravity at the quantum scale as well as computing and technology on atomic and molecular scales. He foreshadowing the development of hot areas of current research such as nanotechnology, quantum computing, and condensed matter physics. The latter is basically synthesizing new materials on a molecular scale and using quantum mechanics to achieve totally new properties for these materials; carbon nanotubes are but one example of such materials. I thought Krauss did a wonderful job explaining the double slit experiment in terms of the probability that a sales person would take a given path between two cities. There are also some wonderful discussions of the total energy of the Universe (maybe zero!), nano tech and condensed matter physics, and quantum computing."
31,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15667960-suchita,4,"Thanks to the ""Halifax Public Library"" that i could get my hands on this book else i would have never known who ""Richard Feynman"" was?. Indeed a great book for those who are a level submerged in the magical world of ""Quantum Physics"". Some of the unsolved experimental results are well explained by Feynman's mind. I simply loved his untraditional approach to understand Physics world better. It was astonishing to discover how he had started so many new fields, then continued and completed by others. Also surprising is his lack of credit-greed, his will to help others in their researches, and above all his un-quenching curiosity. What made Feynman stand out was his conviction and love for Physics. Feynman once was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. Feynman said ""he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties"". I must mention that reading this book and coming across the chain of world famed scientists of World War II inspired me to watch documentaries and interviews/ Lectures of Feynman. People who are keen to solve the mysteries of ""Quantum Physics"" or people who are fantasized by it's stupendous world are the only one who would be able to do justice to this book."
32,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"I started to read this biography because I like the author, Dr. Kraus, who adds a lot of content for the TV science show How the Universe Works. The author calls this a popular biography. By that, scientists usually mean, ""I'm leaving out all the math"". I'm actually OK with the math, but even without the math, the science is daunting at times. Apparently, Dr. Feynman was a bit of a womanizer. The author doesn't go into detail, but he frequented strip joints. He claimed it helped him focus on his equations. It is apparent that Feynman was a nihilist... a man who believes that life just doesn't matter that much. I believe that describes a large portion of America, and just about every European to some extent. Nevertheless, he was a brilliant man. The science is a little dated. This book was published in 2011... a year before they got a clear picture of the cosmic background radiation that confirmed the Big Bang Theory of the Universe. A lot of science has been derived from the cosmic background radiation, so if you want to be up to date on the science, then this book is not for you. It is a biography, history and an account of the basic development of science.I'd say 3/4ths of this book is real good. It sort of dies out toward the end as the author goes through a list of how grateful we should be for all of Dr. Feynman's accomplishments. No doubt about it. He contributed a lot to our existence today, but the list got to be a little long. It started to sound like filler.I'm glad I read this book. I might read it again."
33,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/487578-bryan,4,"I have long been interested in Richard Feynman and I have read several books either by him or about him. This one stacks up well against those. The book focuses on Feynman's development as a physicist, but you get plenty of biographical asides as well. Krauss tries his best to explain to the layman what Feynman was about. He does a good job, but even so, these are hard ideas to grapple with, even when dealt with on a surface level. As in most of the things I've read about Feynman, it's his brilliance coupled with his personality that make him so interesting. He had a knack for sussing out the crux of problems facing present day scientists. He always seemed to be asking the right questions at the right time. He was stubborn and independent and he had a life long aversion to using other people's work to further his own. He needed to work out things on his own first, and the author suggests that this may have hindered him in the long run. You find Feynman dipping his toes into many of the mysteries of the quantum world, and making good progress, but almost inevitably he peters out and will not be the one to resolve the issue and spike the ball. Feynman himself was unsure of his work. He thought it clever but didn't know if he ever had developed something at the foundation of physics. The author disagrees, and shows in great detail the impact of Feynman's work. "
34,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,4,"There are two ways to read this book: trying to understand the quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory covered in this book more in depth and be absolutely mind-blowned about just how amazing (and mysterious) our physical world is, or enjoying the flow of this book as it is and basking in the wonder of quantum physics in a very shallow way. Both ways would give readers an amazing reading experience. I chose the lazier route this time round. However, having a bit of background in physics definitely helps me grasp the general concept of quantum mechanics more easily.I think this book is a great summary of Feynman’s life’s work. It includes both Feynman’s achievements and struggles over the years. By also incorporating Feynman’s personal life as part of the storytelling, especially the parts that influenced Feynman’s career path and research work, it makes the book not only enticing and charming but very readable. I feel excited by the tone the author takes discussing physics principles and am very impressed by how passionate both Feynman and Kraus have been with this specific field of theoretical physics. I love reading about how much people love and enjoy doing their jobs.This is a book that can potentially inspire young people to go into the field of physics. I would especially recommend it to high school students. A solid 4-star book for me."
35,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4262636-john-michael-strubhart,5,"With the disclaimer that Richard Feynman is my all-time favorite physicist, I thought this was a great book. Lawrence Krauss can get goofy with his writing sometime - like in A Universe From Nothing, for instance - but here, he expressed no ideology other than that Feynman was a remarkable person and physicist. That's a claim that is very hard to argue with. I've read the other biographies, but I get the most insight into how Feynman approached problems from this treatment of his life and work. Krauss digs up some of the best accounts of Feynman from people who worked with him or were inspired by him. Being a physicist himself, Krauss went back to Feynman's original publications and the publications of those who built their work on his and even if he had not written this book, I'm certain that he gained a remarkable perspective on how his own work was influenced by Feynman. Now, if you want to read about the adventures that Feynman had - and they are awesome adventures - I would suggest reading Surely, You're Joking Mr. Feynman, What Do You Care What Other People Think and Tuva or Bust. You won't regret it. However, if you want to get a sense of how physics was influenced by Feynman, read this book. "
36,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17219145-william,2,"This is the second book by Lawrence Krauss that I've had to set aside despite my love of the subject matter, the other being A Universe From Nothing. Quantum Man purports to be a layperson's guide to Feynman's contributions to physics. The problem is that Krauss is a poor expositor of science (sue me). The level of depth and didactic polish that he gives to various subject varies tremendously. Basically, if a concept is simple enough for a lay person, then Krauss spills copious ink giving analogies and high school teacher-esque descriptions. Somehow, despite going on forever, theses little forays still feel hurried. If, on the other hand, a concept is deemed to be complex, Krauss simply blasts the reader with its native jargon, explaining almost nothing but acting as though we are all on the same page. This is particularly annoying if, like myself, one knows all of the ""simple"" physics in the book but was hoping to gain insight into some of the ""complex"" subject matter. The story of Feynman's life is—owing to Feynman more than to Krauss—of course interesting and worthwhile. Finally, the copy editing is atrocious, having numerous grammatical errors. "
37,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10888254-gavin-drury,5,"One of the greatest scientists since Newton for me, this book follows Richard Feynman’s rock ‘n’ roll-like life. The story of a man for whom knowledge was his ultimate goal, finding things out for himself, and having such a huge impact on the way we do do physics today. Fame was irrelevant, often willing to attribute his findings to other people. His work on QED and his path over sum approach re-defining the way physics is done. Completing work overnight that other people had already been working on for two years. Lawrence Krauss tells his story through his discoveries and how he came about them in such a way that, like Feynman’s ability to make clear the complicated world of Quantum Mechanics, it is also easy to understand to anyone with interest in the field. In this way, not only is it a fascinating insight into Feynman’s life, but also a great science book too. If this man would have been more interested in contributing to existing fields and complimenting other’s work rather then just wanting to find things out for himself, who knows what he could have achieved."
38,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16277243-clio,0,"Woah. I can't even give this a review because far too much of it was well above my head. I was kinda hoping for a biography of Feynman that went into his personal life, his motivations and his career. Instead I got a lot of quantum physics that Feynman had either created, spoke about or had a tangential relationship with. I am no physicist, and so much of this book was out of reach for me. I devoured the sections about Feynman's life, the early marriage, the scandalous late second marriage and his relationship with the other greats. Then the book whole explain an important discovery and I would glaze over for 20 pages until I got to another bit I could understand. I persevered though, the more I read books like this the more I may understand quantum physics. This has been a goal of mine since I read Asimov's book on black holes. That was roughly 10 years ago and I don't know how much closer I am. This is a great read if you like quantum physics and lots of maths. Otherwise it's a tough read, but you may get smarter. "
39,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,3,"I think this book both succeeded and failed.Let's start with the failure first. This book either doesn't know exactly what it wants to be: (1) a readable story about Feynman the person OR (2) An understandable explanation of Feynman the scientists workAs it is, it does somewhat poorly in both areas. Specifically the explanation of the physics is so vague that it does not enlighten very much.Where it succeeds is in giving a 40,000 foot view of how Feynman's research evolved from the mid 1950s to the mid 1980s and what he was like to work with and how he picked his research projects. It works as a history of how particle physics and quantum gravity research developed over that time and Feynman's role in those areas.So if you're looking to learn a lot about Feynman in his personal life you won't learn too much new and if you're looking to get a better understanding of any of the physics this probably won't be the best book but if you just want a historical overview of Feynman's research then this might be OK."
40,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6745748-cyrus,3,"Another year, another Feynman biography. This one's titled ""Quantum Man"", by Lawrence Krauss. Unlike most other books on Feynman, this one focuses more on his work, theories, thought processes, etc, rather than his character/personality. It skims over the ideas, giving just enough of a sense of the brilliance of the man, without actually writing down a single equation. Unfortunately, Krauss has a tendency to be somewhat fawning in his writing, piling on praises on Feynman without any apparent discomfort. Case in point: Feynman's great ambition was to discover some fundamental truth about nature, which some might argue (Feynman certainly did) that he did not achieve. Krauss, on the other hand, proceeds to frame some of the techniques Feynman developed as being, in essence, the Truth, simply because we are not able to perform consistent calculations at different length scales. On the whole, I'd say this is worth reading, but about 3/4 through the book it starts to go downhill. Fast."
41,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260303-jeff-brateman,4,"This book felt a bit more raw than previous books about Feynman, as in there was quite a bit of hard science. Several of the chapters dig really deep into the theories themselves, and I got lost quite often. Regardless, I am able to say I understand quantum electrodynamics more than before.Additionally, there are many details on important colleagues, discoveries, controversies, and other research issues left out of other books about his personality. Specifically interesting are those related to Gell-Mann, who I had never heard of before in my casual physics knowledge.On the slightly negative side, I was a bit annoyed when the author tried to include tidbits about himself. Rather than making the author more relatable, or qualified, it ended up making him sound pompous. Luckily this was infrequent enough to totally kill my enthusiasm."
42,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18716604-murray,4,"Krauss, who studied with Feynman, gives an interesting account of his mentor's development of the diagrams that helped explain quantum electrodynamics to the world. He gives some account of Feynman’s life, his marriage, and participation in the Manhattan project, his strengths and weaknesses.The quantum mechanics were presented cursorily without explanation.I enjoyed learning how a positron going forward in time was the same as an electron going backward. The best part of Kraus' portrait of Feynman was the great man’s unwillingness to learn from others’ work, preferring instead to work everything out for himself. His greatest ambition was to learn something about nature, and did not care if he was given credit for it."
43,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,4,"Very good book about a man who was not just a genius: he was a super genius. He was also a very appealing human being.I especially liked this book because it was 2/3 about the physics that Feynman dealt with and 1/3 about his life. A warning to would be readers is that the author's discussion of the physics is at detailed technical level. The author is an eminent physicist in his own right and while very interested in Feynman as a person, he is more interested in his physics. So if you have not taken a number of courses in modern physics in undergraduate school, then more than half of this book would be meaningless to you. There remains, however, a lot of material about a super genius that a general audience can understand."
44,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25043686-mike-reilly,4,"Plenty of interesting information about the research and development of quantum electrodynamics but the book is light on personal information about Feynman. Against his parent's wishes, Feynman married his childhood sweetheart, a girl with a shortened life expectancy. She died while he was working as Los Alamos and he seemed to deal with her loss in ways most unexpected of a scientist. Krauss goes a little heavy on the physics (his field of course) but the details about Feynman himself pop up too infrequently. The prose is certainly intended to to be accessible to most readers, but I would imagine that anyone with no science beyond high school would find this to be a tough read."
45,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32902897-sid-sidner,5,"This could the syllabus for a graduate course in QEDI love Lawrence Krauss. I love Richard Feynman. This is a rare history of Feynman’s mind, of his thinking. It is serious, for physicists. I could follow about 5% of the physics. But Krauss is such a great explainer and Feynman is such a singularly unique individual that it was like watching a really good grandmaster chess match. Everybody in 20th century physics is in this book. I was constantly selecting some person or concept’s name and then linking out to Wikipedia. I re-read Lawrence Krauss’s books every couple of years. I’ll certainly add this one to the collection!"
46,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642393-mrh,0,"Haven't read it yet but sounds wonderful. A physicist has written a ""scientific biography"" of this amazing and surprising nobel-winning scientist. Heard an interview with the author on NPR's Science Friday. Feynman was always entertaining, and talking about him can be also. The purpose of the book is to discuss Feynman's work in light of subsequent developments. How has his work influenced the science and technology of today? "
47,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270881-ken-rideout,3,"Any book about Feynman is allright with me! This book is specifically about his scientific contributions and professional trajectory. Written for the layperson, the book has one of the best explainations of the renormalization problems in quantum theory (getting rid of the pesky infinities), but I did glaze over at some of the physics...an overall ok read, but not the best introduction to Feynman - you should already be a fan before you read this one."
48,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7866032-kyle,3,"This is a pretty science-heavy book, not a light biography. Krauss does tell the story of Feynman's life, but from the perspective of his scientific work. It's a bit of a slog due to the complexity of the science (which the author valiantly attempts to make accessible), but an ultimately rewarding read. I understand a little more about physics (though plenty went over my head) and have a renewed appreciation for Feynman via the work that defined him."
49,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4401282-kurt,5,"Krauss's books are always very engaging. This book is no different. Richard Feynman is one of the top 10 most important Americans IMO. He changed the course of history in several ways. Every American should be familiar with him and his work. One surprising conclusion I got out of the book was how Feynman's life highlights the need for a prosperous society to support all types of people, even the eccentric. "

Science bios usually fall under history of the life of the person with some of the science of the person sprinkled in or the other way round. This book is mostly about the science and being a newb to psychics I Can tell you this book still keep me interested.

The depth of understanding of the physics subject matter by Krauss is certainly apparent, and the people he has interviewed and the archives he has searched to get to know Richard Feynman, the man, not just the physicist, is truly a great joy to partake in the great journey that was the life of Feynman! "
52,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12170297-anders-rydholm,5," ""A universe without purpose should neither depress us nor suggest that our lives are purposeless. Through an awe-inspiring cosmic history we find ourselves on this remote planet in a remote corner of the universe, endowed with intelligence and self-awareness. We should not despair, but should humbly rejoice in making the most of these gifts, and celebrate our brief moment in the sun."" — Lawrence M. Krauss "
53,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26822915-greg,4,"Richard Feynman was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century and certainly one of the most interesting. This book by Lawrence Krauss goes deep into the scientific part of Feynman's life. Other Feynman books are focused more on his life, but this one goes in depth to describe the science. I would say 30-40% of the book is talking heavily about science. While intimidating it helps understand Feynman's life. Take your time with this book or you will get lost quickly."
54,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6030627-seth-taplin,4,"This was an engaging account of the scientific works beyond my detailed comprehension, brought back to the ground at a consumable level. I listened to the recording in a single day while driving and stayed thoroughly engaged. Well done! The most surprising thing was how long these discoveries took to become mainstream. From my own life experience, these discoveries of the 70's didn't get to my awareness until the late 80's and early 90's and as a teen I'd assumed they were just happening!"

56,0393064719,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5631784-ahmed-qamesh,5,"Feynman ‘s life and achievements cannot be denied or ignored, he deserve more than what he given , and I think that this book is not sufficient to discover all his entire life in details , even though it is not bad at all.

Written by another physicist, the discussion of the science was of course, largely incomprehensible. One does get a sense of why Feynman is so revered by contemporary physicists and he clearly had a clear vision of what the fundamental issues were in his time and in the near future. I could have done a little less with the privileged, self-indulgent academic, and more with what he did on the Challenger committee."

Although this book did an excellent job of capturing his unique life and personality, I found that I got lost in some of the sections that delved into the technical details of his work. This didn't detract from the overall experience of the novel, but I would say this book is geared towards readers familiar with his fields of study. "
