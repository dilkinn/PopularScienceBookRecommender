0,0452288118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5,"Literate MathematicsA classic in every sense: a model of style and erudition to rank with Oscar Wilde, as inspiring as Zadie Smith, as concise as a page from George Orwell, and as timeless as any of Dickens’s tales. If you have an interest in mathematics, or if you have been scarred by the imposition of tedious calculating techniques in your school days, or if you simply want to understand an enormous part of intellectual history, this is the single most important book you could have at hand. The first edition was published almost 90 years ago. Yet it is fresh and witty and simply full of the most remarkable facts and astute observations about the development and use of numbers. Apparently, for example, birds (particularly crows) have a relatively developed sense of number (at least up to five). Dogs, horses and other domestic animals appear to have none. And the English trice has the double meaning of three times as well as simply many, plausibly echoing the Latin ‘tres’ and ‘trans’ - beyond - thus memorializing an ancient method of base 3 counting.Dantzig‘s factual anecdotes are similarly captivating: “Thus, to this day, the peasant of central France (Auvergne) uses a curious method for multiplying numbers above 5. If he wishes to multiply 9 × 8, he bends down 4 fingers on his left hand (4 being the excess of 9 over 5), and 3 fingers on his right hand (8 – 5 = 3). Then the number of the bent-down fingers gives him the tens of the result (4 + 3 = 7), while the product of the unbent fingers gives him the units (1 × 2 = 2).”The only misjudgment Dantzig makes is his underestimation of binary arithmetic. “It is the mystic elegance of the binary system,” he says somewhat disapprovingly, “that made Leibnitz exclaim: Omnibus ex nihil ducendis sufficit unum. (One suffices to derive all out of nothing.)” Little could Dantzig (much less Leibniz) have foreseen the rather non-mystical importance of the base-two counting in the age of the digital computer.Dantzig is acutely sensitive to the cultural matrix of mathematics. That matrix, he points out, is neither commercial nor academic; it is largely religious. “Religion is the mother of the sciences.” The Greeks of course had several mathematically based religious cults. Even the most recent (and difficult) mathematical field, number theory “had its precursor in a sort of numerology” of biblical texts. (See here for more on the religious inspiration in mathematics: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).But he also recognises religion as a major impediment to the development of mathematical knowledge: “When, after a thousand-year stupor, European thought shook off the effect of the sleeping powders so skillfully administered by the Christian Fathers, the problem of infinity was one of the first to be revived.” Religion, thankfully, shot itself in the foot in interesting ways: “Now, the acquisition of culture was certainly not a part of the Crusader’s program. Yet, this is exactly what the Crusades accomplished. For three centuries the Christian powers tried by sword to impose their “culture” upon Moslem. But the net result was that the superior culture of the Arabs slowly yet surely penetrated into Europe.”Perhaps most impressive is Dantzig’s intellectual humility. He begs ignorance of the philosophical issue of whether or not numbers exist outside of human thought about them. But he is not without an important philosophical view: “Herein I see the genesis of the conflict between geometrical intuition, from which our physical concepts derive, and the logic of arithmetic. The harmony of the universe knows only one musical form—the legato; while the symphony of number knows only its opposite—the staccato. All attempts to reconcile this discrepancy are based on the hope that an accelerated staccato may appear to our senses as a legato. Yet our intellect will always brand such attempts as deceptions and reject such theories as an insult, as a metaphysics that purports to explain away a concept by resolving it into its opposite.”To conclude with this sort of poetic image justifies entirely the description of this book as “an ode to the beauties of mathematics.” "

The book was written in the 30s, author made his last edits in the 50s and my edition is from the 90s. This might tell you that the book is still quite relevant and a landmark for the history of the number from the humble integer to the mind boggling infinities and with it a short history of mathematics, phylosophy and science. If you are researching these topics this is where you start.Considering that this book mostly deals with the history of the concept of number, it avoids going too deep into mathematical proofs and instead tries to tell you a story, so that it could be enjoyed by everyone. Of course there must be explanations for some of these proofs and the Author has done an admirable job explaining it, but knowing some math would help. Everyone who has read a math textbook or other popular books on mathematics has seen how difficult it is to express mathematics in words. I personally would've given up a long time ago and just left pages and pages of pure math and be done with it. Now because the book is so old you could totally skip his chapter of ""Future problems"", because they are all solved, but still interesting to take a look at just to see some of these math problems and research their solutions. And finally the editors thankfully added some book recommendations for further reading, those are on my to read list now of course."
2,0452288118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"On the cover is an interesting mini-review: ""This is beyond doubt the most interesting book on the evolution of mathematics which has ever fallen into my hands."" -- Albert Einstein.With an endorsement like that, what more needs to be said? Indeed, this is a very interesting and very informative book, scarcely dimmed by the passage of years -- it was first published in 1930! In the interim, much has changed; one amusing example is the following statement on page 121: ""Today [1930:] over 700 correct decimals of the number pi are known."" By contrast, in 2010 nearly 3 *trillion* digits are known. And yet much has not changed, and this book remains one of the best exposition of how our system of mathematics arose.One of the best chapters is the second chapter, where the author clearly describes how our modern Indo-Arabic numerical system, which is arguably the greatest mathematical discovery of all time, arose in India in the first few centuries of the common era, and from their percolated to the Arab world, and then to a kicking-and-screaming European world. Dantzig introduces Chapter 2, where this is discussed, with this interesting quote from Laplace:""It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of position as well as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit. But its very simplicity and the great ease which it has lent to all computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions; and we shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement the more when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius, two of the greatest men produced by antiquity."""

While I appreciate the rigor, it ended up feeling like I was reading a math textbook, which is not my jam right now."

5,0452288118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Einstein called this ""the most interesting book on the evolution of mathematics which has ever fallen into my hands.""Number was first published in 1930 with the fourth edition coming out in 1954. This is a republication of that fourth edition (Dantzig died in 1956) edited by Joseph Mazur with a foreword by Barry Mazur. It is an eminently readable book like something from the pages of that fascinating four-volume work The World of Mathematics (1956) edited by James R. Newman in that it is aimed at mathematicians and the educated lay public alike.Part history, part mathematics and part philosophy, Number is the story of how we humans got from ""one, two...many"" to various levels of infinity. Strange to say it is also about reality. Here is Dantzig's concluding statement from page 341 in Appendix D: ""...modern science differs from its classical predecessor: it has recognized the anthropomorphic origin and nature of human knowledge. Be it determinism or rationality, empiricism or the mathematical method, it has recognized that man is the measure of all things, and that there is no other measure.""Or more pointedly from a couple of pages earlier: ""Man's confident belief in the absolute validity of the two methods [mathematics and experiment] has been found to be of an anthropomorphic origin; both have been found to rest on articles of faith.""These are inescapably the statements of a postmodernist. I was surprised to read them in a book on the theory of numbers, and even more surprised to realize that if mathematics is a distinctly human language, it is entirely possible that beings from distant worlds may speak an entirely different language; and therefore our attempts to use what many consider the ""universal"" language of mathematics to communicate with them may be in vain.And this thought makes me wonder. Is the concept ""two,"" for example, (as opposed to the number ""2"") really just a human construction? Would not intelligent life anywhere be able to make a distinction, just as we have, between, say, two things and three things? And if so, would they not be able to count? And would not then the entire edifice of mathematics (or at least most of it) follow?I wonder if Dantzig was not in contradiction with himself on this point because earlier he writes (p. 252) ""...any measuring device, however simple and natural it may appear to us, implies the whole apparatus of the arithmetic of real numbers: behind any scientific instrument there is the master-instrument, arithmetic, without which the special device can neither be used nor even conceived."" Does this not imply that measurements (by any beings) and therefore numbers have an existence outside of the human mind and do not rest on ""articles of faith""?As to the numbers themselves (putting philosophy aside) we learn that the two biggest bugaboos in the history of number are zero and infinity. It took a long, long time for humans, as Dantzig relates, to accept the idea of zero as a number. Today zero is also a place-holder. But what does it mean to say that there are zero pink elephants dancing about my living room? I can see one cow in the yard, or two or three, but I cannot see zero cows in the yard.Of course, today it is easy to see that zero is a number that is less than one and greater than minus one. I have one cow and I sell that one cow. Now I have zero cows. (Curiously, note that the plural noun ""cows"" is grammatically required.) However, the imperfect fit within the entire structure of mathematics that zero has achieved may be appreciated by realizing that every other number can be a denominator; that is, three over one equals three, three over two equals 1.5, etc., but what does three over zero equal?It is a convention of mathematics to say that division by zero is ""undefined."" There is no other number about which the same can be said.I used to think when I was young that infinity was the proper answer to division by zero. For Dantzig this is clearly not correct because to him infinity is not a number at all but a part of the process. He writes, ""the concept of infinity has been woven into the very fabric of our generalized number concept."" He adds, ""The domain of natural numbers rested on the assumption that the operation of adding one can be repeated indefinitely, and it was expressly stipulated that never shall the ultra-ultimate step of this process be itself regarded as a number."" Of course he is talking about ""natural"" numbers. He notes in the next sentence that in the generalization to ""real"" numbers, ""the limits of these processes"" were ""admitted...as bona fide numbers."" (p. 245) In other words, part of the process became a number itself!The culmination of Dantzig's argument here is that infinity itself is a construction of the human mind and exists nowhere (that we can prove) outside of the human mind. He believes that the basis for our belief in the existence of infinity comes from our (erroneous) conception of time as a continuum. Dantzig notes that Planck time and indeed all aspects of the world are to be seen in terms of discrete quanta and not continuous streams.Ultimately, Dantzig gives this sweeping advice to the scientist: ""...he will be wise to wonder what role his mind has played in...[a] discovery, and whether the beautiful image he sees in the pool of eternity reveals the nature of this eternity, or is but a reflection of his own mind."" (p. 242) --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
6,0452288118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/938428-anna,5,"This is another one I pick up a lot. There is some really dense math that is really outside my understanding, but also some incredibly lucid analysis of the development of mathematics and how it has effected the way we perceive and cognate. Tremendous stuff, and humbling!"
7,0452288118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,4,"This book was quite interesting to me; however, the latter portions were more technical than I could well tackle, given my limited mathematical expertise. I did not agree with the author's nominalist views on the ultimate nature of mathematics. My views are more ""Platonist"", given that I am convinced that mathematics has some form of objective existence, and in view of my belief that mathematics is discovered rather than created or invented. Tobias Dantzig believed that logic is a branch of mathematics. I quote from page 245: ""How then can we arrive at a criterion [for the reality of the number concept]? Not by evidence, for the dice of evidence are loaded. Not by logic, for logic has no existence independent of mathematics. How then shall mathematical concepts be judged? They shall not be judged! Mathematics is the supreme judge; from its decisions there is no appeal.""I conclude that this is backward. Mathematics is a branch of logic. Logic is that set of rules of thought apart from which NO THINKING -- including mathematical thinking -- can possibly occur. Since thinking that is non-mathematical can occur, it follows that logic is more fundamental than mathematics. Dantzig placed great emphasis on mathematical intuition as the ultimate guide for mathematics. I believe that intuition is the faculty of the intellect that enables discovery of mathematics, but it is logic that is the arbiter of valid mathematical thought. Logic has the final word. Furthermore, logic is the principle behind all thought, but mathematics consists of logic APPLIED to quantifiable entities and structures. Thus, mathematics is subsumed in logic. I was also not impressed favorably by Dantzig's ridicule of Christianity. On page 129 he wrote: ""When, after a thousand-year stupor, European thought shook off the effect of the sleeping powders so skilfully administered by the Christian Fathers, the problem of infinity was one of the first to be revived."" And on page 197 he writes: ""I see in the work of Galileo, Fermat, Pascal, Descartes, and others the consummation of an historical process which could not reach its climax in a period of general decline. Roman indifference and the long Dark Ages of religious obscurantism prevented a resumption of this process for fifteen hundred years.""If Christianity was such a dark period intellectually, WHY was it that modern science sprang up in Christian Europe? It was not in India, China, or the Muslim countries where science blossomed, but in the heart of Christian Europe. It is not at all obvious that this alleged ""religious obscurantism"" was, in fact, inhibiting mathematical and scientific advances. Admittedly, Christianity had placed a great deal of emphasis on the spiritual life, but there were medieval scholars who were doing serious intellectual work, sowing the seeds for scientific and mathematical advances, even as universities sprang up in Western Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. To relegate this time period to ""Dark Ages"" does not do justice to the intellectual ferments that were brewing during the middle ages in Christian Europe. I found Dantzig's book well worth reading -- and quite challenging. However, as a philosopher and thinker, this author does not get high marks from me. Of course, his profession was mathematics -- not philosophy or religion. However, being a mathematician should not vitiate sound philosophical thinking. To any mathematical hobbyist (among which I am one) or mathematics student, or scientist or philosopher, I would recommend Dantzig's challenging and thought-provoking book. "

12,0452288118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"This was a frustrating read. Primarily for the annoyances detailed below, but doubly so because this could have been such a good book. You have here all the makings of a winner: an ambitious topic, presented in a spunky tone, even spiced up with a bit of philosophy. Unfortunately, ""Number"" is marred by so many editorial fuckups that it borders on conspiracy, and ultimately, the pain is not worth the gain.As the title suggests, this is a book about the historical evolution of the very notion of ""number."" Danzig's tour starts with the crude number sense of animals, and by the time you reach the heady heights of Cantor's transcendentals, you'll have covered a healthy swath of math history. While most of this is pretty standard fare, Danzig has a philosophical flavor to his investigations that kept me engaged (e.g. the validity of infinity, the relation between physics and mathematics, intuitionism vs formalism).On the whole, it's light and breezy stuff - though that's not necessarily a good thing. As is often the case in books like this, everything even remotely resembling a proof has been relegated to a lengthy appendix, and as a result, the bulk of the discussion feel a bit dumbed down. Again, hiding ""the math"" like this isn't terribly uncommon, but here it's taken to an extreme. As a result, the bulk of the book suffers from being overly non-technical, whereas the dense and technical appendix suffers from a lack of context.But.But.[Takes a deep breath]Ladies and gentlemen of the jury: I do not pride myself on being a diligent proof reader. Errors evade my eyes with silky, startling ease. Typos sneak past my glazy gaze for breakfast. But my God are there a lot of errors in this book.Note that we're not talking about a missing comma here and there. Most of the typos show up in the proofs, and are seemingly chosen so as to maximize confusion: ""<"" instead of "">"", ""*2"" instead of ""^2"", ""^2"" instead of ""^3"", and in one egregious case, overloading a symbol to represent two different things (have fun with with the proof on page 300). I can't tell you how much time I burned trying to make sense of flat-out falseness.Look: I get it. Editors aren't mathematicians, and some of these proofs are tricky. But this book was published in 1930 and has seen over 12 different editions since. You'd think someone would have bothered. The preface, at least, is written by a mathematician, and the cover quotes Einstein as favorable reviewer. Only conspiracy explains it. I rest my case.Anyways.In many ways, Danzig's ""Number"" reminds me DFW's ""Everything and More."" It's a different take on math-for-the-masses, written in a creative tone, infused with some high ambitions. And like ""Everything and More"", it's ultimately ruined by sloppiness. Back in the day, the warts might have been worth it. The same can no longer be said. These days there is so much good math writing out there that there's no need to let in bathwater with the baby.Key takeawaysThere have been three pivotal ideas in the history of mathematics:1. The principle of position (coupled with the notion of zero): as soon as you interpret the leading digit of ""20"" as representing something different than the leading digit of ""2"", you effectively unlock arithmetic.2. Using abstract symbols to represent numbers: variables let you think in terms of general solutions, and ultimately unlock algebraic manipulation.3. The Cartesian plane: this unified algebra and geometry and changed how people think about equations, imaginary numbers, etc.Reading notes here.Quotes""And so it was that the complex number, which has its origin in a symbol for fiction, ended up becoming an indispensable tool... moral: fiction is a form in search of an interpretation.""

To be sure, of the past we know only disparate instants, yet, by an act of the mind we fill out the gaps; we conceive that between any two instants - no matter how closely these may be associated in our memory - there were other instants, and we postulate the same compactness for the future.

Its architecture is faultless because it is founded on pure reason, and its walls are impregnable because they were reared without blunder, error or even hesitancy, for here human intuition had no part! In short the structure of mathematics appears to the layman as erected not by the erring mind of man but by the infallible spirit of God.The history of mathematics reveals the fallacy of such a notion. It shows that the progress of mathematics has been most erratic, and that intuition has played a predominant role in it.
