0,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86215-pat,2,"The brief synopsis:(1) Everything good about being human comes from play.(2) If you stop playing you will hate your life, get divorced and probably become a serial killer.O rly?The book is an exhaustive list of claims. They are unsubstantiated. No footnotes, no journal citations. Just a whole bunch of I've been studying play for decades and I am certain it will make you enjoy your job, fornicate with your spouse more often and be more creative.The language is laced with enough technicality to give the appearance of rigorous scientific work, but that only manages to make it less enjoyable to read without providing any support for his claims. Frankly, I want to agree with him on most things (there's something intuitive about being more playful as a mechanism to bring joy and exploration back into ones life), but if you're going to bill play as the primary quality driving human evolution, a bit of data would be lovely. One stray mention of an EEG scan, one of an fMRI study. Other than that, nothing. No reams of data on the statistical correlations of playfulness and happiness. No references to neuroscience labs measuring dopamine release during play activities. I wanted to see something to make me believe this is more than a pile of observations from a guy who really likes watching doggies and babies have fun."
1,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127864-sandy,5,"There were days at the middle school where I teach when I just wanted to fold paper with my students to see them interact with me and each other. These are inner-city toughies who really don't respond to much that passes for standard curriculum. They are angry and antsy and difficult and disrespectful. To watch them transform scraps of paper into sublime objects of beauty. To watch them as they reached outside their usual way of thinking to do something very different.Most days, I just wanted to play. But how to justify this? I am expected to help kids read and write and do well on standardized tests. The kids very often hate me for my troubles. I don't blame them. The dank workbooks of generations gone by are of no relevance to them. Or me.At the end of the school year, I taught my kids origami as a break from the norm. They relaxed and loved it and were delighted with themselves that they could turn scrap paper into beautiful things. They helped each other by explaining--by taking the story--the instructions--and putting it in their own words to help a peer. And they were playing.This experience brought me to Brown's book. He talks about the importance of play in problem solving, social interaction, and, to use a broad brush, surviving this world in a healthy way.Letting go and relaxing through play free the mind to reach beyond itself and thus find answers. Serendipity. Brown's book is full of examples of serendipity in action in the science lab, the corporate conference room, the home sweet home. Play unlocks the mind, lets it sample possibilities, lets it seek and find a new level of possibilities. Play makes dreams come true.Brown makes the statement that we start dying when we stop playing. He's right. His book makes the truth of the statement abundantly clear."
2,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180438-dan,3,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who just had a baby boy last year. He told me that it was great for new parents because it teaches how play is so important to young children. However, the book was also engaging to him because it talks about how play is so important for adults as well.He was right on the money.This book won't win any awards for writing style, but the ideas present you with a fresh look at the everyday world. The author boils it down pretty simply: make sure to do the things you truly love as often as you can. This may seem obvious, but often as we get older we get so tied up with the little things and with our work that we tend to forget to play. Very importantly, he does not write in a completely anecdotal way. He backs up a number of his claims with recent studies that show how play and joy affect our physical and mental states. In other words, this guy isn't just being uber-nostalgic.His definition of play is very subjective, but he does outline a few important points for everyone to follow. Make sure you do something that made you happy when you were younger. Make sure it takes you ""outside of time."" In other words, get lost in it. Also, try to move around. Play can be as simple as reading a book, but true play involves really getting your mind and body to flow together.There were parts of the book that I found a little sappy, but overall I think this book is a welcome reminder to do the simple things that make you happy.And a thanks to Andy for recommending this."

'...[T:]here is a strong positive link,' he tells us, 'between brain size and playfulness for mammals in general.' Brown quotes Robert Fagen, preeminent animal behaviorist, to get at the cause for that need: 'Play allows ""pretend"" rehearsal for the challenges and ambiguities of life, a rehearsal when life and death are not at stake.' And Brown's book is full of such insightful quotes, as well as his own pithy remarks. I've added his 'When we stop playing, we start dying' to my favorite quotes on Goodreads. But it turns into an easy read that starts getting a little too easy. Already pretty 'lite' with just a bit over 200 pages, it still seems bloated, with lots of fluffy filler, and smacks a little of a self-help manual. 'Play' did make me feel good about getting play into my work life, and work into my play life a la James Michener: 'The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his information and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which.' "
4,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,1,"Confucius says: All work and no play results in cranky jerks. Okay, this isn’t true but we can all attest to the importance of ‘fun’. Playtime (and this includes hobbies, arts, etc) is hardwired in our brains and helps us improve life and build strong relationships. No one knows this better than Stuart Brown, MD who explores this field in, “Play: How it Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul”.The first pages of “Play” suitably have some glue to attract the reader but sadly, this dissipates quickly. “Play” begins by exploring the properties of play as it is not something which can simply be defined by a Webster’s definition. Brown goes on to explain how crucial play is for survival, growth, and relationships. However, the lesson is then over. Brown’s execution is weak and there is an absence of a true thesis; as he is virtually only telling the reader that play is important (no more and no less). Like a poorly-written research paper, Brown has no thorough arguments, no notations, and dummies down the information. As a fan of neuroscience and pop-psych books, I generally am blown away by information on the pages of such books but “Play” doesn’t teach much. Yes, there are some interesting facts but these are spread out and are instead blanketed with filler and repetitious data. Extending on this, “Play” reads like an abstract article with a bare bone skeleton begging for some meat. Just as Brown grazes an interesting topic, he leaves it or mentions an experiment but without being detailed or explaining its impact on the topic or on his hypothesis. Again, the reader doesn’t gain much on the subject other than what he/she does within the first few pages.“Play” also lacks a cohesive consistency. Brown’s writing is scattered and contains several instances of opinionated, non-scientific speculations. This wouldn’t necessarily be an issue if he argued his viewpoints or even thoroughly explained them; but Brown does not. “Play” is simply very empty in many ways.Brown’s work does not improve as the pages turn, with the text focusing on personal case studies and “I think” and I feel” phrases pepper the pages. “Play” has no scientific foundation and continues to read like the transcript of a motivational speech targeting parents versus anything of substance. It is a stretch to even call “Play” a pop-psych book. The only highlight of “Play” is the chapter devoted to how playtime affects love, romance, and relationships. Sadly, this borderline ‘strong’ chapter is abrupt and cuts off too quickly. Brown concludes his work with a how-to tip guide exploring how play can be incorporated back into everyday life. This is basically a summary of what was already noted throughout “Play and therefore the ending is not memorable.Too add to the already-mentioned lack of scientific merit, Brown fails to include any notes, sources, or bibliography. Meanwhile, the text is sprinkled with black and white photos which are very generic and do not supplement the text (and are therefore, meaningless).“Play” is a prime example of a passionate author failing to write an argumentative and provoking piece. “Play” is not compelling and doesn’t leave the reader with any insight gained. It is a fast read so at least it is over quickly. Unfortunately, I do not recommend “Play” as it is a let-down."

I enjoyed the concepts being discussed, and agree with the overall premise - that play is an essential and underappreciated part of life.It just would've been nice to have more specifics about the studies he mentions, or at the very least, some footnotes so I could have a look at them in more detail."
6,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3985367-george-martzen,4,It's ok. Go ahead and play in the mud. This is a very readable book that gleans largely from medical research but also uses lots of stories and anecdotes. I especially like his JPL account that highlights the link between childhood manual play and adult capacity for problem-solving. I would have liked to see some sort of citations or at least a bibliography at the end. 
7,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14551209-dan-connors,4,"I was not aware of a National Institute of Play, but it sounds like a good idea. This book came out in 2008 and didn't hit any best-seller lists, but the author is an expert in the power of play and he makes many good points.From an evolutionary standpoint, there doesn't seem to be any good reason for play to exist. It doesn't make you stronger, bring in food, or help with reproduction, so there seems to be little biological advantage for those species that engage in play while avoiding the survival activities that most of nature is about. But exist it does, not only in humans but in many animals up and down the evolutionary chain.In the author's research, he has determined that play is a crucial exercise in helping our brains grow, discover, and try out new things. Without it no progress is ever made. ""In playing, we create imaginative new cognitive combinations. And in creating those novel combinations, we find out what works.""Genuine play is voluntary, purposeless, free of time constraints, inherently pleasing, and takes us into a feeling of flow with life. It strengthens our relationships with those who are playing with us. It gives us meaning beyond just survival.A lot of the book seems pretty self-evident, but it's nice to see what an MD and play expert has to say on the topic. The world could certainly use more spirit of play- there would be less animosity and alienation, and we would all be more willing to open ourselves up to change and new possibilities. People who think they're playing are often just competing, and the fun has been drained out of everything they do. The book encourages us to look back into our childhood and find things that give us bliss, with the understanding that it's not realistic to be playing all the time.The author uses some real-life examples from people he has worked with, as well as some psychological studies to back up his points. He concludes the book with this. ""Play is how we are made, how we develop and adjust to change. In he end the most significant aspect of play is that it allows us to express our joy and connect most deeply with the best in ourselves, and in others. Play transcends both love and work, infuses them with liveliness and still's time's arrow. Play is the purest expression of love.""The book is short at 218 pages, but I still recommend it with 4 out of 5 stars for its unique take on an important topic."
8,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2777896-c-j-darlington,4,"Who would've thought play would be so important in our lives? This book brings to light something I think many of us know on a subconscious level but need to remind ourselves over and over again. After reading this book I believe play is a missing puzzle piece not only in my own life but probably in many of the lives of people I know. Scientific yet still readable, Brown explains why he believes play is the cornerstone to happiness. A few sections were a little dull, but for the most part PLAY is accessible and a much-needed reminder. I'd recommend to anyone for whom life feels dull or monotonous. "
9,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9537132-herve-tunga,4,"Good read. I liked that the author looks at games from a broad perspective. It can be useful to break ice, encourage people to engage through an invitation to play."
10,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"Play is a real treasure of a popular science book. Based on Brown's work as a clinician and deep familiarity with the literature, it moves through the deep important of play to all animals, and especially human beings. Far from being frivolous, play and a playful attitude is associated with learning, with success, and with a longer and healthier life. Imaginative play, exuberant play, and play free from consequence or adult supervision, is what makes us human, and what makes life worth living.Brown strays into pat self-help in places, and Boomer kid-shaming in others, but this book is everything I wanted to be Exuberance to be."

Didn’t get much out of it. So if I didn’t under those circumstances, who will? Maybe I just already knew the information he was sharing given my line of work in the toy industry, and people outside the profession will find more to learn here. "

I discovered that creative play is my play personality, so I'm reinvesting in coloring as play. Great book. It has applications for parenting, managing our own depression, and in the treatment of anxiety and depression in others. Highly recommend."

14,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3751400-hisgirl85,4,4 stars for this interesting audio book on Play and the research and examples of how it effects your life. I loved the narrator's voice and found the information helpful.
15,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95515169-alexia,4,"I give this book 4 stars out of 5 because it was good but they used the word “Play” too much. Other than that I think that the book is really inspiring because it teaches you how to live a life with “Play”.The thing that most made sense to me is how Play can be good and bad in your life, its dependence on how you apply it. And for those of you how don’t understand what I talking about because you don’t know what play, you'll have to read the bookThis book doesn't relate to my hero's journey, cause it just should me how to apply the system play in life. It will enter my heroes journey somehow, because when I'm applying it then it will be in my hero's journey.This book changed me as a reader because I don’t like lots of books, and when I do like them, they change my perspective of reading. Because I liked this book, now I like to read a little more.I would recommend this book to people how to have lots of questions about life and how to solve your problems in life because it did help me see some problems that I didn’t realize and it did show me the way to happiness. “The world needs to play because it enables each person to live a good life”.

16,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Brown takes playing very seriously:""Play is a profound biological process.""""The ability to play is critical not only to being happy, but also to sustaining social relationships and being a creative, innovative person.""Play is the vital essence of life. It is what makes life lively.""""Play is like fertilizer for brain growth.""""Play is the purest expression of love.""With statements like that, Dr. Brown seems to imbue play with some sort of supernatural power that makes you smarter, happier, practically impervious to harm or error, and just all-around better. Ok, I'm exaggerating just a bit, but how can you not decide you need more play in your life after assertions like that?Dr. Brown lays out seven properties of play and a six-step process people go through when they play, as well as seven guidelines on how to incorporate play into your life. He uses examples from the animal kingdom - otters, dogs, polar bears, even hippos and sea squirts - to show how pervasive play is, and how it can teach survival skills. He highlights playful individuals as diverse as Bill Gates, Albert Einstein and Baz Luhrmann to show what play can accomplish. He covers a lot of ground in this book.But rather than giving you a rundown of everything Dr. Brown mentions, I want to ruminate on just one of his pithy points about play and my own related experiences.He says: ""The opposite of play is not work--the opposite of play is depression.""Stay-at-home-motherhood is work. It's a never-ending cycle of doing things that need to be done again and again and again: making meals, washing dishes, doing laundry, sweeping, wiping, scrubbing, vacuuming, sorting, and driving from point A to point B and back again. Frankly, it can be plain and simple drudgery to be responsible for the care, safety and well-being of young'uns, drudgery that can suck the joy out of everyday if you allow it to. When Dr. Brown warns that ""our inherent need for variety and challenge can be buried by an overwhelming sense of responsibility"", I wearily nod my agreement...To read the rest of this review, come visit Build Enough Bookshelves."
17,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4267442-jennifer,4,"What is not to like about a book that encourages me to do what I naturally enjoy doing? This was a light, enjoyable read, that gave good reminders of the importance of play, both for proper childhood development and for happiness throughout life. I found most interesting the research about brain development and play (and sleep, another thing which I love and have long believed is necessary to growth and healing). Brown shares research in both animals and people which shows that the role of such play is not skill based (ie, learn to be a better hunter or fighter), but it is essential to learning adaptivity. Childhood play prepares us to respond to unexpected changes in our environment and teaches us social skills. During play, brains are being rewired. In a good way. (He also shares stories and photos of animals playing, which always make me smile.)Good reading for parents, especially those who might be surrounded by a culture that does not see the value of free time and free play in a child's life. Brown also discusses play culture in hiring practices and the corporate world, showing that time spent in free play as a child does impact one's problem solving skills and creativity in a way that programmed activities do not.Brown's book is not limited to childhood development. He also discusses the role of play in the lives of adults. He demonstrates that play, in its proper place, leads to a greater sense of well being and health. He suggests, for those who feel their lives lack play, that they recall their own ""play history."" He breaks different styles of play into eight categories, which have more to do with why you enjoy something than with what the activity is. For example, one person might love riding a bike because of the sheer physical joy of movement, while another enjoys competing for best times. So your ""play history"" is not just what you did for play, but what did you enjoy about that?As I said, what is not to like about a book that tells us to enjoy playing around? "
18,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3828879-paul,3,"Stuart Brown, MD is the founder of the National Institute for Play. This book summarizes some of the research he's done over the years and it includes some interesting findings that can help make yourself and your teams more creative and effective. In short, making play a part of our daily life is the most important factor in being a fulfilled person.We all play as children, it's part of our make-up, but something happens as we age and many adults start to feel guilty for playing. What does remain is often overly organized rigid and competitive, just like work. Play is creative and innovative and allows us to discover different ways to interact with the world around us. It teaches us the value of mastering skills and, hopefully, how to win and lose. It's everything that lifts us from the mundane. If you feel stifled or lack creativity, your play development may have been disrupted. Brown offers the idea of recreating your play history. Go back to the first joyful experience you can remember and follow the threads. What brought you joy as a child? How can you bring that back into your life? Next, expose yourself to play. Are you open to play now? How can you be more playful? Finally, be active, free yourself from fear and allow yourself to be a beginner.In the work place, play can be seen as frivolous and wasted energy. However, progressive leaders are beginning to understand the inherent link between play and imagination. Creating cutting-edge products or solving problems both benefit from greater imagination. Play also creates an atmosphere of teamwork and camaraderie which improves the work dynamic and increases employee satisfaction and retention.Overall, the book is an interesting read for leaders and coaches that want to bring more creativity and imagination into a team."
19,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5250260-caely,2,"I picked this book based on the recommendation in Brene Brown's Gifts of Imperfection, and I was pretty disappointed. The general principles are sound, and some of the anecdotes are inspiring - I especially liked an early story about a dog and polar bear playing together in the arctic. But overall, the book feels disorganized and half-baked. Stuart Brown's career and credentials are impressive, but it seems like his ghostwriter just piled a series of general interviews together into a book. There's a lot of sloppy, lazy writing. Grandiose generalizations are ubiquitous, citations are virtually nonexistent, and ideas reappear randomly in different chapters with no reason. Most ludicrous were the top-of-the-head lists of random famous people marshaled to illustrate a vague theory. For example: ""Bill Gates left Harvard because he loved computers... Oprah recognized her talents and grew with them. Ozzie Smith, the retired baseball star, as a kid threw balls over the roof and chased them down, imagining himself in the majors. These were emotion-laden choices, not cognitively laid-out ten-year plans."" I was especially frustrated with the chapter ""Does Play Have a Dark Side?"" which read like a defensive dodge of the question posed. His conclusion is that problematic behaviors like addiction to computer games, aggression, and violence are, by definition, not play. He writes naively, ""...when our interactions are based on a foundation of caring, these hurts are corrected and avoided in the future,"" but correction requires self-regulation skills that not everyone has. If play is partly about testing limits, what happens when appropriate limits are not present or not recognized? "
20,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6207151-jacquelyn-fusco,5,"A joyous read. I think we all need this book. I have always been a playful person, but I am renewing my intentions to make my life more playful. Last year, I was very depressed. I became very anxious about how to use my time. I was unemployed, with lots of time, which was what I always dreamed I wanted when I was in school. After an inciting event sparked the depression and it stuck around, I began to despair that life was just a choice between working for a weekend that was not all that great or being bored; either way unhappy. This is the thought process of a depressed person, unable to feel the joy of things they once loved. It is still very comforting to be to be re-assured again and again, in as scientific a way as possible, that life can and should be joyful. When you're healthy and have a decent balance between work and play. I still think 40 hour work-weeks are too long, especially since most work-places make work very difficult to feel playful. That's why the next book I'm reading is: ""Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has The Time"". "

I read it on two short flights this week and while I thoroughly enjoyed devouring it this way, I am afraid I missed some things. That said, this was a good book. It's written well and I appreciate how the author skirts the line between defining the science with keeping this a light-hearted book for laymen. It's an easy read, but with structure! A lot of the things he talks about I already knew, some I was happy to see were already incorporated into my own home and work, and others were new and interesting ways to look at our human relationships. My only complaint, and it's really a small one at this point, is that this book suffers from the bias that SO MANY books written by older intellectuals does. He loses his sense of balance when discussing video games, cell phones, and the internet. Like many in his age group (70s) he just cannot fathom that these can be healthy, interactive, social pursuits. I find this unfortunate, but expected. "

I kept picturing how I can adapt his advice to all aspects of my life, and how easy it really is....we just live in a society where we work work work, and burn ourselves out...we need to make time for ourselves, or life is going to pass us by completely. Stuart Brown is very educated on the topic, and I loved how instead of just facts he incorporated stories about his studies, and how he has come to his conclusions. It kept me interested throughout.

31,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86135494-kamy,3,"In this book Stuart M. Brown Jr. and Christopher Vaughan explain the science behind play and how it shapes our brains and fuels our intelligence and emotions. This book explains how play is essential to all living things, and how it teaches life lessons and skills. Play is also said to be essential and prominent with child development. As people get older they realize that something in their life is missing that makes us excited for our journey of life. This book walks you step by step to help you learn how to rediscover play. There are so many ways to play and ways that it can affect us positively. But not all ways of play are positive and influential, someone’s way of play could be teasing, or bullying others, sadly even crimes. Someone else’s could be art, music, dance, and even playing games. Play can also be a form of addiction. In this book authors Stuart M. Brown and Christopher Vaughan write about how an addiction to video games can be unhealthy and deadly to gamers bodies. Not just from staring at the screen which has been said to “rot” your brain. It can influence life decisions in a negative way, maybe revolved around their addiction. The book says sitting without moving for too long can cause blood clotting, which can result in death. Now, as you read this book you can begin to understand how important play can be in your life whether it’s your children, family, yourself, your motivation, and emotions. This book was very influential, I will go on in life knowing that everyone needs to play to be able to enjoy life, like being in love (mentioned in the book as an experiment). I honestly would have never read this book unless I had to, or someone referenced it to me. I didn’t find it very interesting and it was hard to follow. The same subject and lesson was repeated throughout the entire book, and I felt like something was missing that wasn’t there. I felt like the style of writing didn’t come from the heart like it should have, it just felt like some science experience, which it was, but it felt like it was more than that. It was supposed to be heartfelt and emotional. This book would be good for someone who is interested in how to better understand people, and themselves. Also this book very well may change your life, and that’s one of the reasons why I DO appreciate this book. This would be good for someone who just would like to learn a bit more on how to maybe make their children's childhood more playful and memorable, or just to seek help on play for someone else. Someone interested in learning new things, who is older, maybe working with employees on making work more enjoyable! The purpose of this book is to reach out to its readers to firmly explain and confirm on how important play is to everyone and everything. This book did a wonderful job of making its point and being firm. I feel that is more based towards educational purposes for adults. I feel like I have learned a lot from reading this book and I now know how important this matter is. I decided to read this book to get a better understanding of the meaning play. I didn’t know how many ways of play there are and I now have a better overall understanding of play. I don’t think I’d recommend to myself again, but I’d of course recommend to someone else I feel needs to hear this books message."
32,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16766128-gloria-denoon,4,"I picked this book to read because we have a creative son who loves to play and recently has seemed to develop some aversion towards work or the concept of work, and because I wanted to learn how exactly play enhances learning in educational settings. I’m pleased to learn there should be a continuous dynamic interplay between work and play, and how this interplay may guide us to discover our passion, plan out our paths, fulfill our potentials and better integrate ourselves into the society.The main theme of this book is to demonstrate 1) that play, though meant to be purposeless, has a crucial constructive role in human brain development, 2) that the intrinsically motivated true play can lead us to discover and nurture the authentic self and spirituality, and 3) that play facilitates creativity and innovation –which is integral to fulfillment and harmony of individual, community and the world. Refraining from giving a rigid definition of play, Brown points out play has the following characteristics: apparently purposeless (done for its own sake), voluntary, inherent attraction, freedom from time, diminished consciousness of self, improvised potential, and continuation desire. In addition, he categorizes 8 types of play personalities: joker, kinesthete (have to move around in order to think), explorer, competitor, director, collector, artist/creator, and storyteller.During play activities, people tend to lose the consciousness of self and there are low risks involved. This gives the brain the safety and freedom to explore as many as it can possible novel connections between neurons, which, as a result, enriches the making of the interwoven maps of neuron networks (p.35-36). In Brown’s own words, “The genius of play is that, in playing, we create imaginative new cognitive combinations. And, in creating those novel combinations, we find what works. (p. 37)” To use Byer’s phrases, this is a “simulation and testing” process (p. 34). It is through this process that animals learn to navigate in the wild. Examples in human world include children’s pretend play and adults’ learning appropriate etiquettes at cocktail parties. Brown uses the term “divinely superfluous neurons” to refer to the neural connections that (p. 41) play activities fire up. Because they are something “extra,” we might live a fine life without these new connections. However, the creation, restructuring and incorporation of these connections do maximize the possibilities of our imaginings and will therefore help us to reach our full potentials. (p. 37- 41) Stuart Brown challenges these conventional views: play is for youngsters only, play tends to a waste of time, and play is the opposite of work. His analogy of the life of adult sea squirt to human adult lacking play is a compelling one. I love the idea of maintaining a sense of playfulness throughout life while at the same time being a serious and responsible adult. Brown uses the term “neoteny” to describe how humans, like dogs (versus wolves), are wired to maintain life-long playfulness. This immaturity in turn brings us continuous growth. This is very much in alignment with what Bob Johansen calls “rapid prototyping” as a style of future leadership where we spend less time in planning and leap to action as we learn and modify the course of action along the way. This could very helpful when we do a strategic plan or when we have to make a decision in the face of tremendous uncertainty. Instead of coming up with a perfect plan or waiting for more information, we experiment at a smaller scale and at a lower cost so as to avoid failing hard. The assumption is that if you fail often and earlier, then you are more likely to succeed.  I also appreciate the discussion on the dark side of play. We have to watch out for the downsides of video game and screen-based play. Brown’s spiritual tone gets stronger toward the end of the book where he discusses the practices of “heart play” and Joseph Cambell’s advice to “follow your bliss (p. 202)” He rightly points out that bliss often involves efforts and pains, which is something difficult to convey to children. He uses bike ride on a hill as an example to say that most kids notices that hard part is to get up the hill but don’t see the fun to coast down the hill after they reach the peak. This reminds me of Paul Tough’s book, How Children succeed, and one of the main factor he talks about is grits and perserance.I used to think the search for spirituality is a completely serious matter. His point is that play, due to its safe and relaxed nature, connects us to that deepest soul within. In his own words, “… in the end the most significant aspect of play is that it allows us to express our joy and connect most deeply with the best in ourselves, and in others.” (p. 218)My favorite quotes are:Byers speculates that during play, the brain is making sense of itself through simulation and testing. Play activity is actually helping sculpt the brain. (p. 34)Neoteny is a boon to humans: it has allowed us to come down out of the trees and live anywhere on the planet. We are designed by nature and evolution to continue playing throughout life. Life-long play is central to our continued well-being, adaptation, and social cohesiveness. Neoteny has fostered civilizations, that arts, and music. While neoteny has its drawbacks, it’s simply how we are built. (p. 58)The work that we find most fulfilling is almost always a recreation and extension of youthful play. (p. 64)When we stop playing, we stop developing, and when that happens, the laws of entropy takes over –things fall apart. Ultimately, we share the fate of the sea squirt and become vegetative, staying in one spot, not fully interacting with the world, more plant than animal. When we stop playing, we start dying. (p. 73)Humans are social animals, and play is the gas that drives the engine of social competence. Play allows society to function and individual relationships among many to flourish. (p. 87-88)Sometimes the best way to get the feel of a complicated subject is to just play with it. That’s why kids often learn computer systems faster than adults – they aren’t afraid to just try stuff out and see what works, whereas adults worry that they will so something wrong. (p. 101)True mastery over a lifetime comes from one’s internal play compass. When parents and teachers push too hard to get kids to perform, children do not experience feelings of competence and do not create from within their own sense of mastery. (p. 111)If we are not completely full of ourselves or too serious, we can see that we can do a better job of helping our children be more joyful if we help ourselves remember how to play. (p. 122)Allow yourself to be abundant in your creativity, at first not making judgments about what you think, feel, or do. Simply paly with your ideas, with how you do things. When you are stuck, try imagining fifty “impossible” solutions and then let yourself throw out forty-five. One particularly famous scientists I know told me that the secret to his brilliant ideas is that he has a really big wastebasket. He lets himself enjoy thinking up and throwing out one hundred bad ideas before finding the single good one. (p. 141) “The great performers perform as they do, and so with such grace, because they love what they are doing,” Hogan observes. “It’s not work. It’s play.” (p. 143)Remember the feeling of true play, and let that be your guiding star. You don’t have to become irresponsible or walk away from your job and your family to find that feeling again. If you make the emotion of paly your North Star, you will find a true and successful course through life, one in which work and play are bound together. (p. 155-6)Gaming addiction doesn’t represent a “dark side” to play any more than obesity represents a “dark side” to food. (p. 188)Guidelines: 1.	Take your play history2.	Expose yourself to play3.	Give yourself permission to be playful, to be beginner4.	Fun is your North Star, but you don’t always have to head North5.	Be active6.	Free yourself of fear7.	Nourish our mode of play, and be with people who nourish it, too"
33,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5581535-ren,2,"Academic non-fiction exploring the role of play in the quality, creativity, and resiliency of adults. Very similar to work done by Sir Ken Robinson on finding your element and flow. It seems, from the narrative, that “flow” and “play” can be used interchangeably. While there were some good parts- such as discussing how couples who retain playfulness between them appear to have healthier relationships- much of the book is based on his own childhood experiences of “pick-up” games and serving on an investigative council after a mass shooting in the 1960s. He predominately references other white male researchers (only mentioning three female researchers in the entire book) and speaks from an axiomatic position without backing up his claims. He often declares “it’s simply human nature” without ever addressing the possible sociological impacts. He does not really address differences in gender or race, when he does mention girls’ play it is with very archaic stereotypes. Even more interesting, when exploring this council to investigate the man who committed the mass shooting (endeavoring to profile other possible mass murderers, nonetheless), the council concludes from extensive interviews with everyone in his life postmortem that it was a play deficit that led to this terrible outcome. Not once does the author address the fact that these interviews were post-event and people would be looking for any sign of anti-social behavior to explain the man’s derailment. An Eurocentric hyper-focus on the individual as the one at fault rather than on the community that failed him. More troublesome, he walks a fine line in his analysis of inferring that if you’re abused as a child you’re likely to commit mass murder crimes in the future. Again, why profiling is wrong. The few helpful insights I took away include: “The opposite of play is not work. The opposite of play is depression.”“The self that emerges through play is the core authentic self.”Parental role = no play/no fun“Those who play together stay together”“Play is an expression of love.” The 7 types of play Recommend reading only after having read Sir Ken Robinson, Harriet Lerner, and Brene Brown. Taken by itself, it’s not very helpful. Taken in addition to other work, can provide additional depth to one’s knowledge base. "
34,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65298226-nikki,2,"I liked the idea of this book - I'm already convinced of the power of play and wanted to learn more about it and perhaps find some practical advice for incorporating more of it into my middle-aged existence - but I was underwhelmed by the execution. I agreed with much of what was said about the value of play, but, as many other reviewers have noted, in many places the total lack of footnotes or references undermined the authority of the opinions presented. (One particularly jarring example: ""Studies have demonstrated that most people who are prescribed opioids for pain don't become addicted"".)A couple of his examples were more convincing, such as the account of the CalTech Jet Propulsion Lab finding in the 1990s that it was harder to recruit engineers with practical problem-solving skills from the younger generation, many of whom hadn't spent much time in their childhood ""playing"" at hands-on tinkering. I was also intrigued by his provocative claim that he studied murderers in Texas prisons and found that ""the absence of play in their childhood was as important as any other factor in predicting their crimes"", although again, I'd have liked to see more detail about the study itself.I didn't feel that I got much practical advice from the book either - there are a few ""guidelines"" at the end, but most of them are brief and unsurprising. The only one that I thought worth pursuing was the idea of taking your ""play history"": reflecting in depth on what brought excitement and joy as a child, and trying to find ways to recreate those feelings as an adult. I did also like the insight that as adults, we are ""playing"" when we mentally rehearse possible future interactions while daydreaming, and the intriguing research finding (attributed to Arthur Aron) that couples who tried a new activity together rated their relationships more highly afterwards than those who spent time doing something familiar that they already enjoyed."
35,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85998401-koby,3,"This book explains how play is needed in life and how it can affect us in positive ways and without it it could have a negative consequence. Play can boost creativity, happiness, can make some learning benefits, and social relationships. With animals play lets them explore the environment and interact with friends and foe. If children don't like to play or get to play then it can affect them later in life with stuff like sociability. Stuart M. Brown Jr. and Christopher Vaughan found that play is at the foundation of all personal relationships especially romantic ones. The less amount of play the harder for one to share and care for others. I liked this book because it was very informational. I learned a lot about how playing can help kids later in life. It would have been a better read if they would have used a kid that played and it helped their creativeness as an example that way people would understand better of how playing can help. I liked the styling of writing at certains times it could have been a little bit confusing because of the words they used but for the most part it was a pretty good read.People that would enjoy this type of book are people that wonder how their kids playing can help them. Also people that would like this book are people that are wondering how you some people are more creative than others and playing could be why. The purpose is to explain to people how playing can help kids later in life and to show parents should let their kids play some. I read this book because I like playing and i figured it would be a good idea to see how playing can help. I would not recommend this book to myself. This being because I do not like non fiction books. I like books that are action packed so I wouldn’t recommend this to myself again. "
36,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62059894-cara,3,"A good idea that deserves a better book.The core of the idea is interesting - play is a vital human need, like love or food. But the author, perhaps out of a lack of scientific evidence, cites studies that *may* have something to do with play and then spirals off of them into hypotheses that haven’t been tested.Is he right about most of what he says in the book? Is the opposite of play depression? I don’t know. It’s an interesting concept and while I see where he’s coming from, he has no proof. Lots of things “make sense” when you think about it, but are wrong (for example - too much salt is only bad for people suffering from hypertension. Normal people aren’t affected by large salt intake, and too little salt is a far worse mistake than too much.)It’s especially frustrating when he does cite a study and then posits his own ideas in the same paragraph. A distracted reader might think the study proved his point, when in reality he was just retroactively supplying reasons, for example, REM-sleep and play provide “the same” function because similar regions of the brain light up when you do both activities.Additionally, the steps he provides for reengaging in play aren’t concrete or actionable. It mostly boils down to “remember what you did as a kid and do that.” I waited for more steps than that, but aside from “or play with a child/pet” there were none.Despite the majority of this review being negative, This book is still worth reading for the concept. Just don’t expect science or concrete steps inside it."
37,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138926-clint,3,"I usually like this kind of book, new science written for the layman, especially when it's about the brain and success in life (Spark, Brain Rules, Mindset, and just about anything written by Malcom Gladwell), but this one fell a little short for me. I guess because I play all the time, I'm nearly 40 and still into punk rock, I like video games, Dungeons and Dragons, cartoons, juggling, playing with dogs, etc. But I'm still a pretty serious, sour dude. Also, ever since I was in college, there was something about the word ""play"" as the noun to me the act of playing that bothered me, it just sounded pretentious. We don't say ""write"" is popular form of cognitive therapy prescribed by psychologists, we would say ""writing."" I think we would say dance, but that never sounded as weird to me, because we use the word dance as a single countable thing enough, ""the forbidden dance."" We use play as single countable noun too, but play as in a piece of theater with a story, which is a different meaning.Anyway, basically, play a lot, use your hands too if you can, because it helps keep your brain in that ultra awesome stage it was in when you were a kid and were learning shit at lightning speed.

38,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24914252-yuriy-stasyuk,3,"This was a mix of insightful factoids, anecdotes, and science, but was diluted by ad hoc rationalizations and hypotheses, which ultimately lacked the kind of scientific rigor that’s necessary for making robust conclusions. The evidence base of the book could have been presented in a few chapters.Another note, while I expected this to be a parenting book, it urges people of all ages to ""play"" for cognitive benefits.That said, there were some good takeaways for me:	• Play with your hands. A fascinating story comparing two generations of NASA engineers, those who tinkered with hands as kids and those who focused on academic performance. Ultimately the hands on training group performed better than 4.0 student's who didn't.	• Browns research with prison populations led him to conclude that murerors can can predicted by lack of play in their childhood.	• Animals who play survive better, because it teaches socialization and emotional intelligence - the ability to read others faces.	• Play is a form of cognitive simulation that enables us to build better cognitive faculties as we experiment with ideas in mental spaces.	• Imagination/daydreaming is the mental simulation of potential experiences that prepares one for how to behave in those situations."

Brown Jr., MD, was so dedicated to this field of research that he has even built a museum of play. The book highlights the benefits of play on the brain and how imagination can improve the quality of one's life. It also talks about how many animals (crows and seals, for example) in nature seem to have this natural sense of play. Arguably, one of the more influential books I've read in 2018, I enjoyed this book thoroughly because it had immediate application to a theory I had already been playing with these ideas—that the level of play in an individual's life will determine the quality of their life. Unfortunately, sometimes it's quite hard to recapture that bouncing spirit of bright-eyed play, but I've set an ambitious mission to make everything a game of play, and this book has further driven those ideas to a hopefully highly fruitful conclusion.

The author refers repeatedly to the employer understanding the function of play in team-building, group cohesion, innovation, competence, and creativity. This book emphasizes that work and play are not opposites, but rather are interdependent. Through play, we are able to filter dilemmas and challenges and anxieties through our unconscious. Both play and work transform, re-create, build new relationships and new neuro-connections, and improve both competence and creativity. The text is sprinkled with case studies rather than scientific jargonized proofs. I was a little disappointed that I didn’t see more brain functions and physiological charts. Finally, at the end, the author offers a few tips for ways to initiate play in ourselves. The writing of this book is so intuitive and flows so easily that reading it was like play. I recommend this book."

The power of play in our lives is essential to a truly successful heart filled joyous life. Putting the play back into our lives is needed in order to never again ask the question, ""Is this all there is?"" Throughout my life, I've asked this question at times when all I see in my future is 'same ole, same ole' but now that question tells me that I need to seek and find the play to bring joy to my heart so recharge my spirit with joy from doing things that make me happy, time flies, laughter abounds. I highly recommend this book to anyone who from time to time asks the question, ""Is this all there is?"" After reading this book, I now have tools to never allow myself to get to the blah, bored, nothing in life changes point of asking, ""Is this all there is?"" "

I feel very motivated to notice and embrace opportunities to be playful especially with my kids, knowing how essential it is for their learning, especially learning how to deal with difficult things that will come their way in the future. At least make space and time for them to play with each other and trust that their wrestling and borderline crazy interactions are good opportunities for them to work through any disagreements that arise and judge relationships for themselves. I am convinced of the essential role of play in emotional development in children and in relationships as adults as well.

It makes us happy and give us skills, which we will use later on in life. According to the author, playing involves more than sports: it can be reading a book that you enjoy or riding a horse. It is what keeps you going, what gets you carried away and lost in time, what moves your desire to play. In short, a great book, full of clear examples about research on the topic of play, and a good reminder of how important it is playing in adulthood too. "

However it is also true that there was a boatload of speculation and no real evidence or proof. And when it came to the negative elements, they were dismissed as not truly play. That may be true and it may have happened because people warped play into something else, but to dismiss those from being a danger because they slip outside the label without any prescriptive ways NOT to have the same things happen to you is misleading at best."

It did inspire me to consider my own “play history” and how to incorporate playfulness into my life more. However “play” is used so broadly as to make me feel like he just defines it as: everything good about life. Why yes, I do agree that the set of all things that make life worth living are important to life. By the end, I feel convinced I should add more of this magical ingredient to life, but distinctly lacking guidance on how.

The author goes to the point of saying that mass murderers didn't get enough play time in their youth, but also makes good points about the importance of recess at school, how we mustn't over control our children's lives and allow them no risk taking, and how the opposite of play is not work - it's depression.

We are all natural players, even as adults, although play often takes a backseat in our busy lives. Brown reminds us to incorporate play in our work and lives. Overall an enjoyable read. "

I found it an informative perspective for my professional work but the lack of specifics and blind enthusiasm for the subject matter without rigorous research to back up claims (though the animal studies were interesting) made it a rather boring read.

I did struggle with the lack of citations in the book. I teach my elementary school students to check books for citations and appendices. This helps them to know that the information presented is accurate, and we can trace it back to a reliable source. This book left me with the names of a lot of researchers in the field of play. I will need to look up their research to back up the author's claims. I did find some useful tidbits; however, this is not a book I would highly recommend. "

The unstructured joy of play needs no justification and yet I’ve found it lacking in phases of my life. The scientific and evolutionary benefits are quite interesting as are the numerous discussions of animal parallels. Humans are complex and fascinating creatures in our design and this is a truly illuminating insight into a lighter and yet necessary side of our humanity.

Like Kay Redfield Jamison's book Exuberance, Play discusses both animal and human aspects of the topic at hand, but Play is much more focused on humans, specifically to my delight, adults. My takeaway line from the book: The opposite of play isn't work, it's depression."
58,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"It's a good idea, even and important one. But the book is written like a series of academic articles. That's not surprising since the author is 76 yr old academic. But it does mean there are extra details and overly complex explanations that muddy the message. Bottom line: play is core to being healthy, happy, and successful. "
59,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1152425-garland-vance,5,So many of us take life so seriously that we forget what it's like to play. But play is critical to living a good life -- and it even enhances our ability to work well.My favorite part of this book was learning about the 8 different play personalities. This has now become a conversation in my family and is influencing how we build play into our lives both individually and as a family.

Simply satisfying to also discover some validation to my own personal outlook on life, and playful nature. "

Also some guidance on how to reconnect with your inner child and reintroduce play into your adult life. I did think the book could have been written better: some parts were repetitive, and others touched upon an interesting study for only a single paragraph before switching the focus elsewhere. But overall, I think it was worth reading.Favorite quotes from the book:(1) ""A friend of mine had an experience when this really hit home for him. A guide was taking him scuba diving on a cold morning. The boat ride out was jarring as the boat slammed through a choppy sea, and the sky looked stormy. My friend was griping about all these things, expressing his unhappiness with the cold, bumpy, wet day. Finally, the guide said, ‘You know, Josh, you are never going to have peak experiences if you don’t let yourself go through some discomfort.’""(2) ""A great exercise that I often used for both kids and adults was to ask them to visualize their lives five or ten years in the future, focusing not on whether they want to be a lawyer or be rich, but instead on what they might be doing that would make them really happy and excited. This itself is a kind of imaginative play. It allows people to step out of their everyday life and see the bigger picture. It also allows them to see clearly how they really want their lives to be, to focus on those elements that arise out of the true, core self rather than on what the world wants them to be. Once people have this sort of vision, they are empowered to move toward making it a reality.Remember that the point of this exercise is not to create a five- or ten-year plan for personal development. The point is to clarify who you are and what sort of future speaks to you emotionally. The most rewarding activities and interests come to light when we open ourselves up to them. Goals are good, but overly rigid pursuit of those goals can inhibit growth and understanding. After discovering what appeals to us emotionally, the strongest emotions, or those that resonate the most, lead to the creation of a realistic path forward.""(3) ""Even in casual interactions, the sincere compliment, the remark about the hot/rainy/freezing/damp weather, a joke or sympathetic observation opens people up emotionally. It transforms a grim, fearful, and lonely world into a lively one.""(4) ""Developmentally we all need ‘secret spaces’ in which we can be safely alone and give ourselves over to needed fantasies if we are to adapt to a challenging world."""

145,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4843278-rori-rockman,3,"A great reminder that life isn't just about tangible achievements, and that focusing too hard on outward success can set you up for misery. Also some guidance on how to reconnect with your inner child and reintroduce play into your adult life. I did think the book could have been written better: some parts were repetitive, and others touched upon an interesting study for only a single paragraph before switching the focus elsewhere. But overall, I think it was worth reading.Favorite quotes from the book:(1) ""A friend of mine had an experience when this really hit home for him. A guide was taking him scuba diving on a cold morning. The boat ride out was jarring as the boat slammed through a choppy sea, and the sky looked stormy. My friend was griping about all these things, expressing his unhappiness with the cold, bumpy, wet day. Finally, the guide said, ‘You know, Josh, you are never going to have peak experiences if you don’t let yourself go through some discomfort.’""(2) ""A great exercise that I often used for both kids and adults was to ask them to visualize their lives five or ten years in the future, focusing not on whether they want to be a lawyer or be rich, but instead on what they might be doing that would make them really happy and excited. This itself is a kind of imaginative play. It allows people to step out of their everyday life and see the bigger picture. It also allows them to see clearly how they really want their lives to be, to focus on those elements that arise out of the true, core self rather than on what the world wants them to be. Once people have this sort of vision, they are empowered to move toward making it a reality.Remember that the point of this exercise is not to create a five- or ten-year plan for personal development. The point is to clarify who you are and what sort of future speaks to you emotionally. The most rewarding activities and interests come to light when we open ourselves up to them. Goals are good, but overly rigid pursuit of those goals can inhibit growth and understanding. After discovering what appeals to us emotionally, the strongest emotions, or those that resonate the most, lead to the creation of a realistic path forward.""(3) ""Even in casual interactions, the sincere compliment, the remark about the hot/rainy/freezing/damp weather, a joke or sympathetic observation opens people up emotionally. It transforms a grim, fearful, and lonely world into a lively one.""(4) ""Developmentally we all need ‘secret spaces’ in which we can be safely alone and give ourselves over to needed fantasies if we are to adapt to a challenging world."""

205,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4843278-rori-rockman,3,"A great reminder that life isn't just about tangible achievements, and that focusing too hard on outward success can set you up for misery. Also some guidance on how to reconnect with your inner child and reintroduce play into your adult life. I did think the book could have been written better: some parts were repetitive, and others touched upon an interesting study for only a single paragraph before switching the focus elsewhere. But overall, I think it was worth reading.Favorite quotes from the book:(1) ""A friend of mine had an experience when this really hit home for him. A guide was taking him scuba diving on a cold morning. The boat ride out was jarring as the boat slammed through a choppy sea, and the sky looked stormy. My friend was griping about all these things, expressing his unhappiness with the cold, bumpy, wet day. Finally, the guide said, ‘You know, Josh, you are never going to have peak experiences if you don’t let yourself go through some discomfort.’""(2) ""A great exercise that I often used for both kids and adults was to ask them to visualize their lives five or ten years in the future, focusing not on whether they want to be a lawyer or be rich, but instead on what they might be doing that would make them really happy and excited. This itself is a kind of imaginative play. It allows people to step out of their everyday life and see the bigger picture. It also allows them to see clearly how they really want their lives to be, to focus on those elements that arise out of the true, core self rather than on what the world wants them to be. Once people have this sort of vision, they are empowered to move toward making it a reality.Remember that the point of this exercise is not to create a five- or ten-year plan for personal development. The point is to clarify who you are and what sort of future speaks to you emotionally. The most rewarding activities and interests come to light when we open ourselves up to them. Goals are good, but overly rigid pursuit of those goals can inhibit growth and understanding. After discovering what appeals to us emotionally, the strongest emotions, or those that resonate the most, lead to the creation of a realistic path forward.""(3) ""Even in casual interactions, the sincere compliment, the remark about the hot/rainy/freezing/damp weather, a joke or sympathetic observation opens people up emotionally. It transforms a grim, fearful, and lonely world into a lively one.""(4) ""Developmentally we all need ‘secret spaces’ in which we can be safely alone and give ourselves over to needed fantasies if we are to adapt to a challenging world."""

This book changed my view of what ‘play’ is and how essential it is to my life as a mother, wife, and a human being. "
274,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31849166-carly,3,"I thought parts of it were really interesting, but I also felt there was some repetitiveness and I did a lot of skimming the last half of the book. I did enjoy how he argued for both sides of play, exploring its darker side, and playing (if you will) devil's advocate. It's not groundbreaking, but it's worth the read, especially the segments about how different animals socialize and play together."
275,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93491591-thomas,3,"3.5 stars. I guess I was looking for something different from this book, but it still was interesting. Play, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. It seems to cover a wide range of activities some very easy to apply the definition of play to and some more subtle that I would hardly call them play. No doubt that the nature of play can have an effect on a relationship."
276,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22193373-janet-nicol,3,"Great information about the science of and importance of play. My three stars are for the evolutionary references which to me are always an annoyance. Also the writing is not exactly riveting, but to be fair, it’s more textbook style anyway. I did appreciate all the information about the social science aspects of play in society and development of children. "
277,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,4,"Quick read about play as a lens through which to see many aspects of life. Some background science but not organised in a way you could reallt reference it. The book is mostly a piece for inspiration rather than knowledge, for bettet or worse."
278,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4598240-judi,4,"I like this book and I think it’s a very important, mostly ignored or eschewed subject. It’s a bit verbose, however and there were parts in which I wondered whether there was a minimum word requirement... that being said, he is clear, it’s well thought out and a very worthwhile read."
279,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48012860-jen,5,"Should a wonderful book I wish all folks would read, regardless of your profession. Understanding the importance of play to our health, well being, and future as a species is vital information is today's world."
280,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7931039-maggie-boxey,4,"I needed to read this because play is something I lost along the way. There’s lots of evidence backing up the importance of play in our lives at all life stages in this book. While there were spots that were dry, overall I enjoyed it and am noticing many more play opportunities. "
281,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533479-andre,1,Good:* Contains cute pictures.Bad:* There's almost nothing about science or psychology in this book. It's more of freestyle writing where the author just write whatever he wants without any proof at all.
282,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68283915-robin,5,Everyone should heed this book on playDo yourself a favor and read this book on the value of play for ourselves and for our world. Every day should include a little bit of fun and silliness. 
283,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/533315-rebecca,3,"Some interesting concepts, but I thought the book was wordy. My favorite take away - the opposite of play is not work, the opposite of play is depression. Work and play are complimentary. Lots to think about. I'm going to reevaluate play in my life. "
284,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68000972-sarah,2,More of a psychology book than a self-help book. A lot of animal studies and I prefer stories about people. There are a few practical suggestions for incorporating play into your life but that constitutes less than 5% of the book.
285,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5884695-renetta-neal,5,I understand how vital play is in my life and enjoyed reading this book immensely. It supports the creative counselling work I do and affirms my own experiences of using playful interventions. A read I would recommend to everyone :-)
286,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99597848-amanda,3,"“the opposite of play isn’t work, the opposite of play is depression”A well researched book covering all aspects of the crucial role that play has in our lives. I especially enjoyed his definition of play, something that is purposeless, all-consuming, and restorative!"
287,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28512368-melissa,0,"The good parts were REALLY good, and I skimmed over the really-scientific stuff. I appreciate that this book is written by a doctor since we have books about play from experts from a variety of other fields. "
288,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63790942-jaelynn-horton,4,"I loved how thought provoking this was. I want to go play way more now!! It was helpful to realize what kind of play I like the most, and also learn how to add more play to my life. Only 4 stars because I ended up skimming a few repetitive parts. "
289,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22609580-erin,4,"Good read, but I wish he had included references, notes, additional reading, or something else that included data to back some of the claims. It seems to make sense, but where's the research?"
290,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4645698-tina,2,Painfully repetitive with a few insights sprinkled here and there. Go play instead of reading boring books about playing. 
291,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52812820-kelly-davis,3,"This book shares some important reminders and ideas for a more joyful complete life. It can be a bit slow and clinical at times, but overall a worthwhile read. "

294,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75288327-anthony-alvarez,4,Very creative book that made me think of what areas of my life that I could increase by play.
295,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4843278-rori-rockman,3,"A great reminder that life isn't just about tangible achievements, and that focusing too hard on outward success can set you up for misery. Also some guidance on how to reconnect with your inner child and reintroduce play into your adult life. I did think the book could have been written better: some parts were repetitive, and others touched upon an interesting study for only a single paragraph before switching the focus elsewhere. But overall, I think it was worth reading.Favorite quotes from the book:(1) ""A friend of mine had an experience when this really hit home for him. A guide was taking him scuba diving on a cold morning. The boat ride out was jarring as the boat slammed through a choppy sea, and the sky looked stormy. My friend was griping about all these things, expressing his unhappiness with the cold, bumpy, wet day. Finally, the guide said, ‘You know, Josh, you are never going to have peak experiences if you don’t let yourself go through some discomfort.’""(2) ""A great exercise that I often used for both kids and adults was to ask them to visualize their lives five or ten years in the future, focusing not on whether they want to be a lawyer or be rich, but instead on what they might be doing that would make them really happy and excited. This itself is a kind of imaginative play. It allows people to step out of their everyday life and see the bigger picture. It also allows them to see clearly how they really want their lives to be, to focus on those elements that arise out of the true, core self rather than on what the world wants them to be. Once people have this sort of vision, they are empowered to move toward making it a reality.Remember that the point of this exercise is not to create a five- or ten-year plan for personal development. The point is to clarify who you are and what sort of future speaks to you emotionally. The most rewarding activities and interests come to light when we open ourselves up to them. Goals are good, but overly rigid pursuit of those goals can inhibit growth and understanding. After discovering what appeals to us emotionally, the strongest emotions, or those that resonate the most, lead to the creation of a realistic path forward.""(3) ""Even in casual interactions, the sincere compliment, the remark about the hot/rainy/freezing/damp weather, a joke or sympathetic observation opens people up emotionally. It transforms a grim, fearful, and lonely world into a lively one.""(4) ""Developmentally we all need ‘secret spaces’ in which we can be safely alone and give ourselves over to needed fantasies if we are to adapt to a challenging world."""
296,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87469894-tom,5,"Good reminder that we need to incorporate the act of ""play"" into our daily lives. All animals experience play. Play bring joy, encourages creativity, and forms community."

299,1583333339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4942621-dawn-fielder,5,"I used this book in professional development with preK teachers. It is well written, easy to understand and has helped me to question my thoughts and practices regarding play."
