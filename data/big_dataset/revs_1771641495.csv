0,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938805-brian,4,"This is a great intro to a fascinating subject, written with the casual reader and layperson in mind. It is almost unbelievable that we know so little about such an important part of our body (scientists know more about bees than they do about our belly-based bacteria). Our digestive system is the only part of our body that operates outside of the purview of our brain. Perhaps this is why we have so many emotional expressions that we tie to our belly (""gut reaction"", ""butterflies from being in love"", etc.)Here are some other nifty things I learned:95% of our body's serotonin is produced in our gut.Our gut bacteria have 150 times more genes than a human being.Saliva produces a painkiller called opiorphin - stronger than morphine and only discovered in 2006.The surface area of our digestive system is about 100 times greater than the area of our skin.Studies have shown that our gut bacteria has the ability to influence cravings in our brain for particular foods.The total mass of bacteria in our body equals roughly 2.2 kilos.A fun, informative read. I look forward to advances in science that will help us to recognize our own personal gut flora and what we can do to best care for it."
1,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,4,"*review based on Audible audiobook*This is a book which is perfect for audio. Written for the layperson, it is informative and funny, but without the added benefit of an amazing narrator (who is able to get the tone just right), it may have seemed a little bit silly. Another reviewer noted the abundance of exclamation marks- in the text, that might be annoying, but when read aloud by Katy Sobey, the jokes and wry exclamations seem just right.The content was interesting and entertaining, both educational and practical. Despite my background in healthcare and personal experience with an irksome gut, there was lots here I didn't know and tips I could put into practice. This is not just a boring run through of the mouth-anus journey, Enders uses up-to-date research to show how scientists are finding out more and more about how the gut can affect the body in surprising ways. From how having a baby by caesarean section can leave the child more prone to asthma, to the links between certain gut flora and depression, risk taking, and suicide, this book is a trove of fascinating information. It also has a section on what your poo should look like. In other words, it has it all. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know a bit more about how their body works."

I understand that the author was trying to keep it ""light"" so her readers wouldn't start yawning and dozing off on facts parts, but I think it would be better off without it... Oh well, maybe I'm just not the target reader for this book. In general - pretty good, informative and rather recommended, especially if you didn't know you shouldn't put your fingers in your mouth after scratching your butthole. You're welcome!"
4,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"Recommended for those who would like to know more about how their bodies work, but are afraid of biological/medical jargon. Written by a young woman in medical school, this work explains things in lay-person‚Äôs terms and is very accessible.A pretty good section on our reliance on gut bacteria to mentor our immune system and help us to process our food. She explains very clearly why too much cleanliness is not necessarily a good thing. (Did you know that the whole ‚Äúcleanliness is next to godliness‚Äù idea was part of the campaign to stop the spread of tuberculosis? That our society‚Äôs disparagement of public spitting dates from this epidemic?) I guess I was expecting too much of the book however‚ÄîI know that the gut & the skin develop from the same embryonic layer and that there are quite a few links now between gut problems and skin rashes. I was hoping for a more detailed discussion, but it occupied only a few sentences in the book.Also, I continue to search for something that will explain the connection between gut bacteria and food intolerances/sensitivities and suggest useful methods to cope with such things. This was mentioned in passing, but no ‚Äúhow to help yourself‚Äù guide. Rats!A good, basic explanation of how the digestive system works. "
5,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3,"DNF at 80%. I'm over the gut. I really, really enjoy science books, especially anything having to do with medicine/the body. That make sense, of course, seeing as I have a degree in a medical field, but I really can't get enough of learning about the human body. However, after listening to Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal, which I enjoyed very much, I thought I was ready for another round of intestinal delight. I was partly right. What Mary Roach does is she breaks up a never-ending stream of facts into a story-line, of sorts. That wasn't really done here. While I found the information interesting in Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body‚Äôs Most Underrated Organ, I missed the personal anecdotes and stories from ""Gulp,"" which has very similar subject matter. Also, while the narrator of ""Gut"" was pretty good, she didn't hold a candle to the narrator of ""Gulp."" I still liked learning about the alimentary canal and intestinal tract, and I still bored my family to death with random gut facts, but it got to be a little... drab for me. Time for me to move on to another body part. "
6,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48716353-ella,5,"I absolutely loved this! I learned so much about my own body it‚Äôs crazy! I am pretty sure I have been raving about this book to my friends and family so much they could probably say they have read it as well haha I had to share everything I learned since it feels so crucial we all are informed about what goes on inside us. All the bacteria, all the processes are fascinating and I ended up watching a lot of videos on YouTube about this (some were quite disgusting I have to admit üôà)Highly highly hiiiiighly recommend this to pretty much any human being out there (maybe even to cats haha as there is a chapter relevant to them as well) "
7,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"This book gives us a warm and friendly journey through the gut. Written in easy terms for the layman, and generously illustrated by the author's sister, this is a very accessible description of the journey of food through our bodies, and the critters it meets on the way down.Giulia Enders is a doctoral student, and she wrote the book in response to a friend wanting to know more about the gut. To do this she did a lot of research, as is shown in the bibliography at the end. Regarding the bibliography, she notes that the books and papers cited cover issues not found in standard medical textbooks. To be honest, I found some of her ideas a little wacky, or to put it another way, she gives equal weighting to all the ideas she puts forward. I felt that someone with more experience in the field might have been a bit more discriminating, or created more of a hierarchy of solutions. Enders sort of throws open the doors and leaves us to pick and choose.I may be so wrong in saying the above. Her book has had fantastic reviews from most of the major newspapers - and I certainly learnt a lot from it. Plus I enjoyed reading it - and given the subject matter that is quite an achievement.One final whinge. There was no index. I think that was a real oversight.I end with a sprinkling of notes - mostly taken directly from the book - purely for my own record.(view spoiler)[ How to pooSquatting has been the natural pooing position for humans since time immemorial. Haemorrhoids, digestive diseases like diverticulitis, and even constipation are common only in countries where people generally sit on some kind of chair to pass their stool. Of course this is not the only cause for these problems, but the difference in countries where they squat rather than sit is noticeable. Our position on Western toilets can be rectified (especially when we are having problems), by A) Inclining your upper body forward and B) Placing your feet on a low footrest in front of the toilet. This way all the angles will be correct.Teeth and jawsTooth enamel is the hardest substance produced by the human body. And it needs to be, since our jaws can exert a pressure of up to 80 kilograms on each of our molars - or approximately the weight of a grown man. When we encounter something hard in our food, we pound it with almost the equivalent force of an entire football team jumping up and down on it before we swallow it.TonsilsBefore we reach the age of seven, our tonsils are still an important training camp for our immune cells. For reasons not yet understood, removing the tonsils of a child younger than seven can lead to an increased risk of obesity. Tonsils of children below this age should stay in, unless there is a very good reason for taking them out.The removal of tonsils can improve things for people with psoriasis and it can also help certain people with rheumatic diseases. (It helps those people whose tonsiller crypts are shaped so they easily trap bacteria.)Gluten sensitivityOne person in a hundred has a genetic intolerance to gluten (coeliac disease), but a considerably higher proportion suffer from gluten sensitivity. The latter is not a sentence to a life of gluten avoidance. Those with this condition can eat wheat without risking serious damage to their small intestine, but they should enjoy wheat products in moderation. Many people notice their sensitivity when they swear off gluten for a week or two and see an improvement in their general well-being. Suddenly, their digestive problems or flatulence clear up, or they have fewer headaches or are less plagued by tiredness.Lactose intoleranceLactose intolerance is not an allergy or a real intolerance but a deficiency. The body requires a digestive enzyme to break the chemical bond found in lactose. Lactose breaks down when it comes into contact with the gut wall (& the enzyme), and the resulting single sugars can then be absorbed. If the enzyme is missing, similar problems arise to those caused by gluten sensitivity, including belly ache, diarrhoea and flatulence. In 75% of the world's population, the gene for digesting lactose slowly begins to switch off as they get older. The older the person, the greater the probability that she will be unable to break down lactose.However, lactose intolerance does not mean you must cut out milk products altogether. Most people have enough lactose-splitting enzymes in their gut, but their activity is somewhat reduced - say down to about 10-15 % of their initial level. So you can simply use trial and error to find out just how much your body can deal with, and how much dairy produce it takes to make the problems come back.Fructose intoleranceThe most common food intolerance in Germany (the author's country), is a problem with digesting the fruit sugar fructose. This can be the result of severe congenital inability to metabolise fruit sugar, but most people affected by fructose intolerance actually have a condition more accurately described as fructose malabsorption, and only experience problems when exposed to large amounts of the sugar. When fructose is described on food packages as 'fruit sugar', consumers often assume it is a healthier, more 'natural' option. This explains why food manufacturers choose to sweeten their products with pure fructose, and consequently why our digestive systems are exposed to more of this type of sugar than ever before. Furthermore, globalisation and air transport mean that many Western consumers are now exposed to a previously unheard-of overabundance of fruit.Fructose intolerance that appears later in life is thought to be caused by a reduced ability of the gut to absorb fruit sugars.The fructose intake of the average American is currently 80 grams a day. Our parents' generation took in only around 16 to 24 grams a day. (hide spoiler)] "

In the year or so I have had a fascination with my own gut, after my doctor surmised that my stomach problems were because I have IBS. Since then I have read countless articles and watched countless videos on the subject, in an attempt to help me manage my gut and its problems better. So naturally, when Gut by Giulia Enders was released, I had to get it and read up on the subject from a more scientific point of view.This book was a truly fascinating read, and I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. Unfortunately, I didn't have the foresight to keep a notebook and pen beside me while reading, because I would have liked to have had a list next to me that I could go back through again in more detail. However, some of the things I learned were why antibiotics are only a good thing in the most extreme cases, why not all creatures can vomit and why it's a good thing we can, how babies born naturally as opposed to with a caesarean section are better protected with bacteria in their early months, and how it's not actually probiotics that will do our guts the best but prebiotics.There were definitely sections of this book that interested me more than others, such as sections on allergies and intolerances, vomiting (despite my fear of the subject), and how the brain and the gut are a lot more linked than we might have previously thought. However, particularly with the latter section, I would have loved to have seen a bit more information as I felt they were way too short in comparison to other sections. I also wish there had been more of a focus on issues such as IBS, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease - although all three were mentioned, I was hoping for a bit more information on what causes them, and what can be done to manage their symptoms.I enjoyed Enders writing style for the most part - she manages to balance some of the more fact-heavy sections with light-hearted humour which was nice (particularly for someone who is relatively new to popular science). However, there were times where I found the constant jokes less funny - she uses a lot of metaphors throughout the book to illustrate her point, but they did seem at times more for comedic value than to help further clarify her points, and a lot of them I could have really done without. I did however like the pictures that accompanied the text, drawn by her graphic designer sister Jill Enders, and they were actually very helpful at seeing certain elements of Enders text more clearly - for example, in how our food travels through our body.Overall this was a fun and very entertaining read, and I did learn a lot from it. Although there were things I would have changed and gone into more depth about, this is probably a really great starting point for science n00bs like me, who want to know more about our own body and its role in our everyday lives."
9,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,3,"Rating 3* out of 5. I'm not charmed. I found the writing childish with too many exclamation marks and didn't find things as funny as the author obviously did at times. I like the first 100 pages the best because of the numerous new things I learned, but the for the rest of the book I mostly just wished it would be over already. It's supposed to be fun and engaging and probably is to most people - to me it just fell a bit flat."
10,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,3,"This is a jaunty, easily digestible pr√©cis of intestinal biology, an enterological cornucopia of facts and figures and buttock-clenching anecdotes. Expect a lot of often fascinating talk about poo and farting, rather like a Monty Python sketch without the punchlines, as well as layman's introductions to the latest research into probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, the human biome, and the mysterious relationship between your gut and your brain. I learned a lot. I also made several strategic alterations to my diet, so it clearly connected on that level.The author, Giulia Enders, is still studying for her PhD, and the book came about after a TED-style talk she gave at a Science Slam event went viral in 2012; if you understand German, you can watch it here (she's so young!). She writes about her subject with a smile on her face, fending off embarrassment with a no-nonsense, almost mumsy joviality, leavened with a few judicious euphemisms. It's all rendered into perfect colloquial English thanks to David Shaw's translation, which, at least in this edition, is refreshingly British in idiom. I'm not sure how it compares to Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal, which I haven't read, but if you're interested in what you eat, how your body works, or just want to binge on some high-fibre factoids, Gut is a solid pop-science choice."
11,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15945083-nigel,5,"I find it quite hard to know just what to say about this book. It is one of the most interesting books I've read in quite some time. It is also one of the most improbable page turners I've read. The illustrations are wonderful and quirky.It's a book about what happens in the passage between the mouth and the backside. At times maybe it is not for the faint-hearted. You will learn quite a lot about your poo! However you will also learn a lot about your gut bacteria and their impact - frequently surprising - on your life.It is actually quite a scientific book. The book talks about the bad guys - Helicobacter for example. And then the next section talks about a bacteria that can be beneficial to you - Helicobacter... Some section really did make me go ""wow"". As an example the section on Toxoplasmata - a genuinely quite nasty inhabitant of the guts of cats but sometimes they stray.I'd be surprised if most people who read this don't start questioning aspects of their (or their families) lifestyles. Allergies and intolerances are far more prevalent now - does this book possibly explain some aspects of that? Why if we kill off all the bacteria we possibly can by cleaning everything are we still experiencing similar rates of infections?Entertaining, thought provoking, accessible and well written - I'd be happy to recommend this one to anyone with any interest in the subject. It might even change the way you sit on the loo :-)"
12,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,Nice and short little primer on the digestive system. Learned quite a few things I didn't know.4 StarsListened to the audio book. Nicely narrated by Katy Sobey.

It also included a lot of information I hadn't known, either because it was new, or because I hadn't been paying attention.Recommended.Ta, L."
14,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21381864-anatoly,3,"This was a nice and an interesting read. Although written in simple language and full of humor and funny anecdotes, this book is quite informative and encompasses a great deal of knowledge. But, this is also it`s downside. This is a really good start for those who don`t have any prior knowledge on the subject or don`t have a scientific background. But for those that are looking for something less light and a bit more scientific I would recommend something else. "
15,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"If you are looking for a book on gut microbes and want to avoid pseudoscience and delve into a book which contains solid science, this book is an excellent choice. Oddly, I find that ratings for pseudoscience books like Perlmutter's Grain Brain are often higher than they are for books written by responsible scientists who will not make claims or provide any suggestions that are not scientifically studied and replicated. My guess is that real science, which doesn't yet have all the answers about microbes, is far less sexy than pseudoscience books that can make any claim or suggestion they like, while playing fast and loose with the actual available evidence. The Good Gut by the Sonnenberg's contained a hippie vibe as well as solid science. This book has less of a hippie vibe but is far more rigorous than even the Sonneberg's book. So even if you were hoping for more of a hippie vibe, I would actually recommend this book over The Good Gut, only because it's actual scientific content is better. Adding to that, Enders is a fantastic writer and her tour of the human digestive system was absolutely fantastic. I have not found such a wonderful description in any other book. "
16,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3798335-karina,3,"A lot of overlap with Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal, naturally, and - as it turns out - I prefer Roach's style. This one has cutesy illustrations and a title that makes a horrendously cute rhyme in the German and Norwegian editions, which is obviously a plus."
17,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,4,"So, where do I start? It took me a really long time to finish this book and honestly, this is one of the best books I have read this year. Your digestive system is the underdog of your body and if you don't take care of it, the implications that it has on the other aspects is immense. You are what you eat. The book explores everything a layman can understand - from eating to antibiotic resistance - everything that you will need to worry about when dealing with your digestive system. Conclusion: A great read! It is very informative and this is a must read if you suffer from gastric issues. Also, love the author's sense of humor."
18,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3057525-sadie,4,"The (original German) title nails it: Darm mit Charme (charmful gut / gut's charm), for this is a very charmful book indeed. It was not only super interesting and helpful, giving the reader lots and lots of insights of what is really going on down there, below the stomach area, you know, in this bundle of intestines that somehow transforms food into, well, poop. But that's not all it does by far - and even though we know about some of the gut's extra powers, might have read or heard about its inhabitants who keep the flora in peace, abouts its intelligence and about its super powers to fight diseases, we (well, at least I) don't really dwell too much on these informations. Because hey, there's the shiny brain with its super intellectual powers, there's the heart keeping up the beat, there's the skin that needs its treatment - but the gut? Ah well, toilet talk.And this is where Giulia Enders enters. Not only does she present this awesome amount of interesting information, it's also how she does it. The charming part. Her writing is adorable, not in the ""lemme tell you about poo poo, twinkie winke""-childish nonsense kind of way, but in a way that is respecful yet close to the subject... and full of love. What I mean is: Her adoration and awe of the gut shines through on every page, in almost every word, and it totally took me over. I loved her style, all the little tidbits, the often sweet and/or funny comments. That, combined with the wonderful illustrations contributed by her sister made this book a very special treat for me.Plus, it told me about the sea squirt, an animal whose only goal in life it is to find a place to settle down forever. And once it found it and settled in, it eats its own brain, for that organ is no longer neeeded. Oh, sea squirt - maybe you were right all along?"
19,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6120135-mary,5,"Ok, I'll go (down) there, Enders presents a tour de force of the alimentary canal focusing on the importance of gut and its beloved, misunderstood bacteria. This book makes it to my very short list of most helpful books ever. Plus she's a gen-u-ine scientist, clever, funny, likeable and has mastery over the substance and content of her book. She makes the case that the human body is gut-heart-lungs-brain. Other researchers contend that gut bacteria should be classified as an ORGAN! Thank you sweet Jesus for not letting me tolerate the smell of cat urine (if this concerns you, google toxoplasmosis asap) That said, I have absolutely no qualifications to evaluate this book. It's a gut reaction.I would love to see the original German phrases and folk sayings that had to be substituted into American for the English language translation. Just knowing that Enders is German made this journey all the more delicious. The way she lovingly (and at times lusciously) describes bacteria and how we imbibe them made me want to run outside with a bottle of kombucha, frolic in the dirt, roll down to the beach and kiss some strangers. Eskimo kiss a dog's nose for dessert?I learned a lot, altered my way of thinking and lol'd throughout this book. Must read for anyone with the interest and the fortitude (excluding, of course, MDs and scientists who [think they?] know more than she does!)"
20,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,2,"Second in importance, only to the Brain, in our miraculous body is what is called the Gut. Gut is the shortened name of gastrointestinal tract which is the long tube that starts at the mouth and ends at the back passage. It includes the Liver, Gallbladder, Stomach, Pancreas, Large and small Intestine, the Appendix and Anus. The author claims that much of our health is determined by the Gut including Allergies, intolerances and reflux. The one interesting bit of information the author provides is that 130 or so years ago it was discovered that Tuberculosis was caused by a bacteria and since then bacteria has been associated as dangerous. However the fact is that more than 95% of the World‚Äôs bacteria are harmless to humans and many are beneficial. She advises making the aim of cleaning to reduce bacteria but not to eliminate it. You can achieve this by diluting such as washing fruits with water. This will wash away some bacteria but still leave a harmless amount. The other way to control bacteria is by keeping things dry. Bacteria cannot live on dry surfaces. What she offers to help your gut is to eat prebiotic foods. Prebiotic foods feed the good bacteria in your gut. The most nutrient dense prebiotic foods are Asparagus, Bananas, Onions, Garlic, Cabbage and Beans.I otherwise found this book a disappointment. It did not keep my interest throughout the book."
21,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Any human, healthy or not, would probably learn something of considerable help when reading this book- that's how many exact facts are here. Some of which you have probably wondered about (especially if you've had kids or changed diapers or had travel/motion sickness) or even have had side effects of constipation or dry mouth from travel or medicine. Tons of other excellent and pertinent details that doctors never truly discuss with their patients. She also has consistent humor and intellectual kindness in her giving you a ""heads up"" when the more messy or unpleasant aspects are minutely detailed. She knows what to tell you and how to impart it.This taught me about foods, about different peoples having different bacteria in predominance in the gut- and all kinds of issues with pace of digestion and antibiotic ""after effects"". Some of the information here will also give you some extra red flag help to determine illness or depletion or all kinds of other organs' issues that you would not think are at all connected in case and effect.The graphics were cute and so poignant!

Including some that I will never forget and with which I permanently scarred my husband by having him which YouTube videos on what they are. I'm looking at you Tonsil Stones (don't look up videos on this on YT unless you are not squeamish). This book really motivated me to add some more fermented foods into my diet, and to look at my gut as something I can improve to help all areas of my life. I love books like this where you walk away with a new wealth of knowledge. Plus since with grad school the only books I seem to finish recently are audiobooks while I drive to campus and then walk around it for several hours, the narrator of this book was fantastic! "

I especially liked learning that the appendix is not a useless appendage and that it is surrounded by immune tissue. The tonsils are also surrounded by immune tissue and both of these appendages play a role in our health. The information in this book was presented in an easy to understand way.

Our eyes have been opened, in part due to books like this.Gut is written with the layperson in mind. You don‚Äôt need to be a scientist. In fact, Enders is quite funny and even charming as she describes all things gut.For me, Gut was an easy listen. As I mentioned, parts of it may make you a little squeamish.

I learned so much about the digestive system (A SECOND BRAIN?!), am now totally enthralled by it, and am motivated to eat in a way that is kinder to my happy bacteria friends.I took away one star because sometimes Enders gestured towards some almost-pseudo-science, and I felt there were some questions that were either never addressed or that were glossed over. (What happens in the gut when we sleep?!) Maybe that last part is a bit harsh, seeing as how she couldn't possibly cover EVERYTHING in 260 pages. Nonetheless, there it is.

And get to know about things which are often embarrassing but nonetheless important and even miraculous.The best thing about the book is that it‚Äôs completely devoid of complex medical jargon and therein lies its success. It can become an effective companion for just about anyone. Though from the title it may seem like it‚Äôs a long boring rant about our digestive system, but it‚Äôs far from that. The author writes in a fluid and crisp language that‚Äôs easy to grasp and hilarious at the same time. Backed by strong scientific research and studies the book touches on a whole lot of interesting topics- from the friendly microbes in your stomach to the food you should or shouldn‚Äôt eat. And even on how to check on your poop once in a while to make sure they are of the right consistencey!This charming book succeeds in putting across some important information of how our body functions in an entertaining and informative manner. The content of the book is so important that it‚Äôs worth your time reading this. Coupled with lots of humorous illustrations by the author‚Äôs sister, ‚ÄúGut‚Äù is an important book that‚Äôs not too preachy and a book I am glad to have read."

I learned a lot. It's such an important topic. We have to be aware of how consequential gut health is to the health of the rest of the body!"
30,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76051348-michael-clark,3,"Gut is a fun and informative read about the gastrointestinal tract. It‚Äôs thoroughly entertaining. Giulia Enders‚Äô writing and passion for the gut is charming, endearing and, at times, a little infectious (dad joke).The only reason the book didn‚Äôt score higher is that Enders occasionally over simplifies the topic (making it come off a little juvenile). Her heavy reliance on tangential anecdotes also starts to get a little tired towards the end of the book. It‚Äôs almost as if she doesn‚Äôt trust enough in the fact that other people will find the gut as interesting as she does."

33,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57297080-hanin,4,"It's a pretty good book, I really enjoyed the scientific part about the communication between the gut and the brain. I recommended for those who would like to know more about the world of our gut, why cleanliness is not necessarily a good thing? why does acid reflux happen? what is the link between the gut and depression? how gut might modify our mind? are all bacteria useful? and what is the disadvantage of antibiotics? The information is clear and concise, easy to read and informative without using too much medical/scientific jargoun. "
34,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27482054-huyen-chip,5,"An informative and fun read about the little guys in our bodies. I never thought much about how our gut flora affects our physical and mental health, but wow. Full of facts that you can use to gross out your dinner guests."
35,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87900859-sudarshan-baliga,4,I took this book after I had abdominal issue for more than two months. Author has done a good job in explaining everything in layman's terms. Gut flora was new to me never knew that microbes are so important. Glad I read this book it has everything from acid reflux to poop colour.
36,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20494551-tweedledum,5,"""You are what you eat "" if you thought this aphorism was quaint but irrelevant this book will certainly encourage you to revise that view. Not for the faint hearted or chronically hypo-chondriac reader and certainly to be read or digested in small doses.... There's a lot to take in! Nevertheless the most complacent and habit driven consumer should find some pause for thought in reading this excellent and often humorous distillation of current understanding about that most underrated but highly important organ... The gut. Hats off to Giulia Enders who has done a magnificent job in bringing all this complex and often confusing information to the lay reader. Giulia is driven by passion having self diagnosed her own terrifying descent into having open sores all over her body which would not respond to treatment as somehow linked to a course of antibiotics. Now an MD and gut specialist in her own right Giulia is determined to impart her hard won knowledge to as many people as possible. I urge you to read this book and pass it on to as many friends and family as you can. If just one of those people decides to breastfeed their baby, becomes less obsessive about cleaning so that ""good bacteria"" have a chance of recolonising, becomes healthier as a result of slightly modifying their diet, recovers from a long standing allergy or gut problem, or improves their resistance to infection so that they are no longer susceptible to a rampant microscopic invader it will have been well worth it. Personally, although the book is really well subdivided and has lots of great and often amusing illustrations I found the audio version, which Giulia herself narrates, easiest to digest."
37,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7310558-liina-bachmann,4,"How we eat is one of the biggest underlying causes of many diseases in the modern world. Thet advice you get in the form of yet another campain mostly states that ""eat more vegetables this is good for you"" etc. It is about as useful as to nudge a smoker to quit smoking because ""its's bad for you"". And anyone who has ever been addicted to nicotine knows how well this works. What we need is, more books like ""Gut"". That a grown up can be a child again and discover the uncharted landscape of her body. To be amazed of how unbelievely complex and advanced system every living human is. Only then is there hope that people will respect themselves enough to eat well and treat their organs well. Because our organs are ours for a lfetime and how on earth could anything be more important than nurturing them so they'd cooperate with us until our final days. ""Gut"" points this out incredibly well. It gives interesting info without being boring or ""textbook like"". Accompanied with fun illustrations you soon discover that you've read half of the book in one sitting - a page-turner about poop, among other topics! It is about your gut but it is also a sharp reminder that everything is connected in our body and don't you dear think that you can eat shit and overwork and food supplements and sleeping it off once a week won't have any consequences. Our gut is very sensitive to stress and Enders has lots of scientific material to prove it. 4 starts only because in the last chapter Enders packed too much info too densley and the ""fun factor"" of reading was therefore a bit diminished. "
38,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2328903-kristina,5,"Let me start with a curious fact so that I can have your attention:
‚ÄúAround 90% of the serotonin (one of the hormones of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù) in our body is produced in the gut.‚Äù
No wonder why there is a proverb ‚ÄúLoves goes through the stomach‚Äù. We just love to eat, at least I do. :D And that is the second reason I chose to read this book. The book is written very simply, yet very informative. I love the way Giulia Enders talks about the topic; there is always something funny and intriguing. I enjoyed the scientific parts as well. It‚Äôs easy to grasp. I also fancy her enthusiasm on the topic. Not to mention the illustrations drawn by her sister Jill. So amusing.Now, I‚Äôm very familiar with my gut flora, and I‚Äôm super happy about it. More serotonin, yay! :)Also, as a matter of fact, I want to share with you what was the title of the Bulgarian translation of the book. Literary, it was ""A gut with charm"". I love this translation because it's intact with the book itself and it makes it even more appealing and at the same time preparing the reader for the style in which it's written. Cute!P.S. If you wonder what was the reason I chose to read this book, then we have at least two things in common - we both have a gut and we are both curious. :)P.P.S I plan to write a more resourceful review containing everything I learnt from the book. Bow to the Kindle's clippings!"
39,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91492781-tracy-challis,5,"I saw Giulia Enders give a TED talk online and I was hooked. She was entertaining, funny, and educational. Her book was the same. She makes the digestive track fascinating!! We have a universe of microbes and bacteria within us - many with ‚Äúminds‚Äù of their own. Our gut influences what we eat, what we crave, and how much weight we hold on to. I found it interesting that humans give so much credit to the brain, but it is the gut that is in the thick of things. The gut has a remarkable system of nerves to gather information for the brain. It has a huge surface area that makes it the body‚Äòs largest sensory organ. Everything else pales by comparison. The gut is a huge matrix sensing our inner life and workings. I have never thought about all the figures of speech attached to the gut and our digestive organs. We can be ‚Äúscared shitless‚Äù or ‚Äúshitting ourselves‚Äù with fear. If we don‚Äôt complete a job we need to ‚Äúget our ass in gear.‚Äù We ‚Äúswallow our disappointment‚Äù and need time to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù a defeat. A nasty comment leaves a ‚Äúbad taste in our mouth‚Äù and when we fall in love we get ‚Äúbutterflies in our stomach‚Äù. Our gut is like our second brain - but one that is under appreciated and often misunderstood. This book is so interesting and written in a very accessible way. So much to learn (and digest!)"
40,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Gut is a fun light read; it‚Äôs not in-depth or academic at all ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt even have an index! ‚Äî but it is fun and informative for a layperson. There‚Äôs no technical stuff here that isn‚Äôt explained, and there‚Äôs a fairly light tone to all of it, sometimes quite irreverent. Sometimes, however, you can‚Äôt really say it‚Äôs irreverent because it‚Äôs full of an enthusiasm and awe for our digestive system and everything it can do.My main quibble was that it was too casual, too light, too much for the layperson. This wouldn‚Äôt be my chosen field even if I wanted to, but with just a couple of other books covering similar topics under my belt, a lot of it was just boring. (For example, for stuff on microbes, go for Missing Microbes by Martin Blaser, instead. Much more informative and in-depth, albeit not so easy a read.)It‚Äôs fun, and it probably works well for the intended audience; I‚Äôm just not that audience, really. I did learn some interesting facts, and the diagrams/illustrations are pretty fun.Originally posted here."
41,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2926986-michael,4,"Your gut bacteria are what you eat. A light and informative read, guiding us through the secrets and science of our digestive system and gut bacteria. While this might seem an odd book to read in popular science, it demonstrates the role gut bacteria have in our overall weight gain, or loss. Our personalities, and the roles bacteria play, some of which can trick us into eating unhealthy foods. The book provides an evidence-based approach to demonstrate how the gut flora influence biology, physiology, personality, and inheritable traits in offspring. Taking a light hearted approach, the books engaging writing style, funny comments and illustrations guide us through awkward questions from simple as ""how does pooping work"", through common problems like allergies reflux, vomiting, constipation, etc. Finally, the book ending with the influence of gut bacteria on our minds and emotional states. With the latter part of the book discussing whether gut bacteria are good or bad, and the role of probiotics and prebiotics."
42,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,3,"Probably more like 3.5. This is a very readable and very interesting overview of how our digestive system works, from the top down, if you will. I enjoyed it a lot! I didn't rate it higher as there were things that I wish she covered more in depth, or explained more fully. And the writing style was light (which I thought was nice for the general public) however there were some passages which were a little too jokey, if that makes sense, without adding a huge amount to comprehension. Not a huge deal, though I just felt the book would be stronger if the tone were shifted a bit. It won't go too far into helping you understand particular digestive issues or what you should do about them, but will give you information to understand how the got works which can help you in further reading and understanding, etc."
43,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7026018-julia-blacklivesmatter,5,"""Gut"" is a a book I'd recommend to everybody. It's funny, it's informative and written simply enough to be understood even by a person with zero knowledge on the human biology.For me, personally, it was eye-opening. I've struggled with weight and stomach problems for the most part of my life and I finally know why - from a scientific point. There were also many facts that I had no idea about and things I've only heard about and vaguely knew what they meant. It's rare for me to read a book and feel ""filled up"" with knowledge afterwards.It honestly had that much impact on me. Now I pay attention to my gut and try to listen to what my body is saying so we can all be happy.I've already recommended this brilliant book to all my friends and even clients, so yes, I definitely think you should read it!"
44,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18349619-amrita-srikanth,5,"What I learnt from this book:- Why farting is good for you- A depressed mind could be linked to a shitty (pun intended) gut- 50 Grades of Poo - the good, the bad, and everything in between- Why I should continue ending my meals with good old yoghurt- The next time I feel like a small, useless speck in the universe, I must remember that I have a universe inside of me...And a whole lot of other shit!Very interesting, very entertaining, and the little drawings throughout the book are an added bonus. Made me want to go back to Biology class and show this book to my teacher - ""THIS is how you should have taught me the subject!"", I would have said. In my mind. Because I don't want to hurt her feelings."
45,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6476980-rebecka,3,"This is a very interesting book, full of useful information and fascinating facts. It's written in a style that really doesn't appeal to me though, and as a result of the wordy style, it is also a bit too long. I'm not sure if it's somewhat poorly translated as well, or if the original is at fault, because I found many sentences hard to follow (as they defied standard Swedish sentence structure and logic unnecessarily, which requires you to read them twice to figure out what's what in them) and some explanations were pretty weird and vague, probably due to extreme simplification. The translated title in Swedish/Norwegian really beats the original though."
46,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5690772-hazel,5,"Entertaining and informative overview of our digestive system. I've read other books about the gut but I find this to be the most useful. I'm certainly going to be doing some thing differently at home in light of the things I learned front this book. For instance, I'll be using less disinfectant at home. There are still many things we don't know about the relationship between the gut and lifestyle diseases like heart disease and diabetes, but there are lots of research going on right now in this field. Love the illustrations and her sometime tongue in cheek writing is funny. So easy to read and understand our body's complicated processes. Definitely will recommend to my book club! "
47,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33859190-ilona,2,"Let's be clear, this is not a bad book. It is just that I am not the target audience for this book and therefore didn't find it very interesting. This book tells us all about the workings of our digestive system and the microbes inside it. It is very informative if you don't have a background in medicine or microbiology (or biology in general), and want to know more about your gut. The book is well researched and contains many references to recently published work. I just wished that the references were indicated in the text, so I could easily look up and read the scientific articles Enders talks about.Two stars"

And it is all tied into our emotional states, so that gut punch news and the anxious stomach with its ominous pit is my ENS doing its thing. It makes me wonder how wise it is to separate our gastroenterology and psychiatry branches of medicine. We humans are complex machines and it is a little frightening that our body mechanics have specialized into such narrow specialties, especially when all we really care about is whether our whole body is running efficiently. "
49,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3960665-ryan,5,"Gut introduces the world of the digestive tract to a mass audience -- both the organs and systems themselves, and then an extensive look at the microbiome and how they all interact with other systems, overall physiology, health, psychology, and to some extent culture. This is a very easy read and is accessible and interesting for a mass audience. There were a few cases where she used overly ""cute"" analogies which actually were harder to understand than the underlying concept, but overall it was very good."

52,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,So interesting!
53,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14203269-carla-carla-s-book-bits,5,What a page turner! This is really really up there along with my fave Mary Roaches.
54,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7499654-maria-lasprilla,5,"This book was in my wish list for a couple of years and when I chose it, I knew it was one of those I would truly eventually get to (as opposed to many more added to the 'to-read' list to then make me doubt if it was really me doing it). So much that early this year after having a dream about it I immediately went and ordered it from Amazon. It didn't disappoint one single bit. In fact it exceeded expectations because I had my serious brain activated and ready to take in complicated words to describe complicated processes but I actually ended up laughing! The author is just amazing at explaining scientific concepts and connecting details while utilizing humor and pop culture. Would you imagine a book that talks about poop also talking about ballerinas, giving you a sauerkraut recipe, describing motivated swimming mice vs apathetic ones, and the importance of keeping your virgin olive oil cool? I bet not. But she does so and is even able to connect them. A funny and educational book that will get you thinking more deeply about your eating habits, your moods and your (in) ability to focus. Highly recommended."
55,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5137559-blake-roche,3,"A drag. Interesting at first but wears on and on and repeats basically the same five points over a few hundred pages. Take every Facebook post about your gut health you‚Äôve ever seen, combine them together, and that‚Äôs this book. Nothing is cited, everything is vague, basically no information is new or exciting. Will make a layman say ‚ÄúOH REALLY‚Äù and then change their lives based on no evidence. Every man‚Äôs science book, but not for those looking for something actually interesting. P A S S. "

Maybe the readers with a very low amount of information might get the best possible results. Moreover, there was too much jargon, term, and unsuccessfully polished scientific statements. "
