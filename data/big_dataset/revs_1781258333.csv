It did, but I felt like most of this information I had heard before in some form or another. I suppose it is nice to have a reminder to get ample sunlight during my daily routine. I have experienced bouts of seasonal affective disorder in the past and know first hand how it can affect your mood.It is rather depressing how far removed modern society has made itself from nature. Linda Geddes points out this gap and how the ancients, and some members of our era, made better use of this natural resource.I enjoyed the history lessons about the Romans and their solariums. They used ""heliotherapy"" to treat a variety of illnesses. I also enjoyed the studies about the potential effectiveness of ""chronotherapy"" for patients suffering from certain mental disorders as well as learning about efforts to increase their sunlight by towns that receive little light during the day. For example, there's a town in Norway that put mirrors on top of the nearby mountains in order to direct more sunlight their way.As we know more about the importance of sunlight, I'm certain we'll see more efforts to incorporate this information into our daily routines. And it affects things we may not even consider from school start times to a good night's sleep.Recommended for readers who want to learn more about how the sun affects our lives and some of the newer scientific research about the same."

Like Matthew Walker’s Why We Sleep, this is a book chock-full of facts that should be common sense, yet are more like a body of knowledge we have lost as we have become disconnected from natural human behavioral patterns. We weren’t meant to work nights, or to stay awake for many hours in the glow of artificial light after the sun has gone down on a winter’s day.Geddes experiments with making do with only candlelight after sunset for several weeks. She also investigates seasonal affective disorder and “circadian lighting,” surveys the history of sunlight as a medical treatment, gives practical advice for minimizing jet lag, and weighs the case for abolishing daylight savings time. Whether you’re a regular reader of popular science or not, you should pick up this concise and highly readable book by a science journalist; it delves into topics that affect us all. It’s one to keep on the shelf and refer to the next time you cross time zones or change your work schedule."

Here's the best review I saw online: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...Their take-home summary: “Get lots of natural light, not too much direct sun, and avoid blue light at bedtime.” If I were you, I'd go read the Guardian review now, if you are at all interested in the topic -- it's well worth reading, even if you don't read the book. The publisher's summary is worth reading too.The details are interesting. Geddes has done her homework. She's a pretty good writer, and it's a short enough book that you can easily skim to the next topic that catches your interest. I was particularly interested in the effects of sunlight (and bright artificial light) on health. More time in the sun seems to be better (even with the risk of skin cancer) than less. Circadian rhythms seem to affect the action of many drugs -- they are more effective when taken at certain times of day.I found the first couple of chapters pretty dry, as is some of the science-history stuff. Her recounting of camping trips and visiting the Amish and the Druids didn't interest me. I recommend the book with those minor reservations. Strong three stars.Her endnotes are mostly weblinks. I looked for an online copy, to avoid the tedium of typing in long URLs, and couldn't find one."

The sun is not just about getting your daily dose of Vitamin D or some warmth. There are so many factors that are affected by sunlight. I was met with many surprise facts (which I won’t spoil) that I never knew before, it was a revelation! ✨Nowadays, we encounter a different battle with artificial light and this is one we are not doing very well at fighting against. We are instead kept in a constant state of “semi” light which isn’t enough during the day and is too much at night!Every cell in our body has an internal clock and that means every cell is affected by the effects related to light exposure. As I spend so much time at a screen in a dimly lit room, only to go home be in the same circumstance, it was obvious why I couldn’t sleep at night! My body simply didn’t know what time it was! ⏰I noticed that my mood would slip during the winter. Understanding how much I was deprived & being shown the methods to help has literally brought light into my life!I bought a lamp and not any kind of lamp, one that generates up to 10,000 lux which is VERY BRIGHT! The best part is I have actually noticed such improvements in my life, mental abilities as well as my mood. Whilst, I can’t really avoid the dullness during the day, I can improve my mornings by brightening them up and improve my nights by dimming them down.This book has taught me to work with my body’s natural rhythm to feel more alert, better rested and to be honest, happier. Guess I could say it brought me a bit of sunshine! ☀️"

This source of energy has played a pivotal part in the development of life on Earth and not unsurprising, it has been a focus of our collective attention for time immemorial. Many cultures have worshipped it or have tracked its regular path through the heavens and tried to elucidate meaning from it.As the sun has been a central part of almost all the Earth’s inhabitants, lots of creatures have evolved in tandem with it, including us. Research has shown that the sun is key to our mental well being, sleep, immune systems and circadian rhythms. Too much sun is bad for us as it can cause skin cancers but then so is too little, those that rarely see the sun do not generate enough vitamin D that is essential for their health.One of the biggest disrupters to our health in the modern day is artificial light. Ever since the light bulb was invented, cheap affordable light has been available to all so we have retreated indoors turning pallid in the glow of the modern screens. Office lighting is a good example. The output from the ceilings lights is fairly poor, you only get a fraction of light, around 200 to 300 lux, which is nothing when you compare it to the amount light on a bright day which can reach around 100,000 lux. All of these effects are cumulative, and if you live in northern Europe, then you are much worse off in winter because of the very short days.I liked this book a lot, it does what a good popular science book should do, gives you a good overview of the subject and touches on lots of different subjects without becoming too academic. On certain elements, for example, on our body clocks and how to improve lighting for those on shift work, in particular, Geddes explores them in a little more depth. Worth reading."

PSA: most modern lights emit blue light at night, not just screens. Yes, your fluorescent bulbs and LED lights are keeping you up and screwing up your circadian rhythms. Sleeping in on the weekends is just messing with your circadian rhythms more (although the sleep is important). And so much more... I had to special order this book used from England, not sure why it wasn't more available here in the US because it is revolutionary. Full disclosure: I was doing a lot of research on blue light before I bought it and even considering that this would be a good subject for a book, but now I can just read it instead of having to write a book. Or maybe I will someday write a different book. I feel like there are a lot of shifts I need to make in my life after reading this.

13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887705-nina-321,3,"One of those “quite pleasant but nothing special” books. I did learn a few interesting facts and as a sun worshipper and heliophile, the topic of ‘the science of sunlight’ (subtitle) is of intrinsic interest to me— but the prose is so-so, nothing special, and the style is a standard “popular science” style: personal anecdotes and memories, interviews with professors and specialists (along the radio model: don’t cite or quote, but get the person to speak in their own voice), not a particularly critical or critiquey stance towards sources, many web-based sources (so it’s quite different from “academic science” style). Nothing awful or offensive here so that’s good!My best take-aways:- In adults, cognitive performance peaks mid-morning.- Muscle-strength and flexibility peak late afternoon.- To combat jet lag: it’s the time zone that your body clock thinks it is in that matters. When travelling eastward (UK to Australia, UK to Spain, US to UK, California to Toronto): go to bed earlier; seek out light 6 o’clock to 18:00 (your body clock); wear wrap-around sunglasses 18-6 (or go to sleep if it coincided with night in your new time zone). When travelling westward (Australia to UK, Spain to UK, UK to US, Toronto to California): go to bed later; seek out bright light 18-6; wear wrap-arounds or sleep (if it’s night in your new time zone) 6-18.- Jet lag is an example of circadian desynchrony or circadian misalignment. Grogginess upon waking is called sleep inertia. Clock-wise is sun-wise.- To trigger sleep, body temperature must drop by 1 degree Celsius. A warm shower, even on hot days, helps.- Embrace the differences between the seasons. Don’t try to maintain the same pattern of activities year-round. Liking winter is associated with greater life satisfaction.- Being outdoors even on a gloomy winter’s day exposes you to many more lux than being in a brightly-lit office. The author sat in a park in winter where she measured 600 times more illuminance than in her office. During summer, Amish people are exposed to an average of 4,000 daytime lux, compared with 587 lux among Brits. The full moon on a clear night is 0.1-0.3 lux and 1 lux in the tropics, the same as candlelight.- In the morning, we need bright blue light, in the evening dim orange light.- Humans sleep in 90-min cycles, each with REM and NREM sleep. The first half of the night has more NREM, the second half more REM. NREM removes superfluous memory stuff and helps to consolidate new memories and skills. REM sleep fine-tunes emotions and enables creative insights. Short bursts of light NREM are called spindles and archive new facts and physical skills to long-term storage.- Sunburn is bad but so is sun avoidance. Outdoor workers risk skin cancer but are less likely to die from it than office workers who “binge-bathe”.- The sun rotates once every 27 days."

This one is about sunlight and its effect on our bodies and minds, and what the rise of artificial light means for humans as a majority.I found this a very easy nonfiction book to get into, it was divided into various chapters which looked at the beneficial effect of sunlight on people, what being deprived of natural light does to people, as well as what we can do to counter the effects of modern society on our biological rhythms. It was very interesting to see just how much our bodies relied on sunlight to run all the body systems, not just the ones related to sleep (though this one did come up). Much like the book on rest, there aren't as many studies on sunlight as there are on other aspects of health, like diet, but it is a well-reported treatment throughout history.Yes, the author does highlight that sunlight, much like many things, is best taken in moderation and she does not ignore the skin cancer link, but she does point out the antibacterial properties of sunlight, on skin and healing. Too little and too much are both dangerous, just in different ways. She also talks about Vitamin D supplements and how they aren't nearly as effective as actual sunlight, which means there is something we have not found out about yet in the processes that go through out body from the sunlight and prevent diseases such as rickets. Again, mental health is highlighted here as sunlight can help to reset a sluggish circadian rhythm, which has been closely linked to depression (both a cause and a symptom of it), but sunlight is also helpful to prevent depression and other mental health issues. Mostly due to helping someone sleep but the author is quick to point out that while we know there's a link, we don't understand everything about this link. This is definitely a book I would recommend and I especially liked the tips about helping to adjust your circadian rhythm, as a night shift worker.4.5 stars! "

Let's go get us a little.”― Nora Roberts, The HollowIn Chasing the Sun, Linda Geddes explores into one of science’s newest areas – chronobiology, the science of organismic cycles in relation to solar rhythms and how the Sun affects human health.Across the ages, in civilisations separated by thousands of miles of land or ocean, people have revered the sun as both a creator and a destroyer – a relationship that continues to this day. The Greek doctor Hippocrates, who is often referred to as the father of modern medicine, recommended sunlight for the restoration of health. He promoted sunbathing and constructed a large solarium at his treatment centre on the Greek island of Cos. Hippocrates believed that sunlight could be beneficial in the treatment of most diseases, although he warned against excessive sun exposure, pleading for moderation – wisdom that still holds true today.Geddes assembled a wide variety of topics on chronobiology: US Amish communities living dawn to dusk and off grid, submarine crews who rarely see the Sun, the challenging light and sleep conditions on International Space Station (ISS) - which completes a full orbit of the earth every 90 minutes - which means that astronauts will see a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes, right to light that gives owner of a building a right to maintain the level of illumination, seasonal affective disorder(SAD) and finally the German spa town of Bad Kissingen - the “ChronoCity”.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018...https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-...https://theconversation.com/explainer...https://theconversation.com/a-small-n...https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019...https://www.theatlantic.com/health/ar...Benifits of Sun exposureIn the mid 19th century, Florence Nightingale recognised that the sick benefited from fresh air and sunlight. She observed how, in hospital rooms that contained windows, almost all patients lay with their faces turned towards the light, ‘exactly as plants always make their way towards the light’ – even when lying on that side of their body was uncomfortable or painful to them. But this sunlight is missing in many hospitals. Current British guidelines for intensive care units (ICUs) recommend natural daylight in every patient’s room, as well as artificial lights that can be dialled up or down. However, even in hospitals that follow this guidance, bedside illuminance during the daytime is similar to that in many offices – and well below the levels found at sunset outdoors. Florence Nightingale also stressed the importance of observing the ebb and flow of sickness, rather than relying on averages, which she felt were often misleading.Most of us are aware that we need regular sun exposure for vitamin D production, which is essential for building a healthy skeleton, but scientists are now discovering new, and astonishing, health benefits to being outside. Mounting evidence suggests that our sun exposure over a lifetime – even before we were born – may shape our risk of developing a range of different illnesses, from depression to diabetes (This was an animal study, further research is required to see if sunshine has the same effect in people. https://www.nhs.uk/news/diabetes/suns...)Children playing in narrow alleyways, between tall buildings, isolating from any sunlight and add nutritional deficiencies because of poverty to the mix, and the result are children with bowed, deformed skeletons. Sun exposure can reduce blood pressure. Our skin can produce nitric oxide – a potent dilator of blood vessels. We stockpile vast quantities of a storable form of nitric oxide in our skin, and it can be activated by sunlight. That’s the reason why people’s blood pressure readings are lower in summer than in winter. Our increasingly nuanced understanding of the clocks in our bodies is also being used to make drug treatments work better – and with fewer side effects. over half of the WHO’s essential medicines – 250 drugs found in every hospital in the world – hit molecular pathways regulated by internal clocks, which could make them more or less effective depending on when they are taken. Such information is rarely communicated outside of academic journals. For example, guidance on the NHS website explains that valsartan can be taken ‘at any time of day’. Pharmaceutical industry interest in drug timing also remains small.The seasonal flu vaccine was recently discovered to generate four times as many protective antibodies if given between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., compared with the results when given six hours later. Certain medical tests will also give different results depending on when the measurement is taken, which is why many doctors now take multiple blood pressure readings over the course of 24 hours, before making a diagnosis of high blood pressure. Human studies have also suggested that survival prospects are improved if patients have heart surgery in the afternoon rather than in the morning. Chemotherapy drug, irinotecan, is better tolerated in the morning if you’re a man, and in the afternoon/early evening if you’re a woman (an example of Yentl Syndrome. https://longreads.com/2019/06/21/yent...)The importance of the body clock can also be seen in sports. Sleep expert Cheri Mah has been collaborating with the US cable and satellite sports channel ESPN, on its ‘schedule-alert’ project, which aims to predict basketball games that will be won and lost on player exhaustion. To do so, Mah weighs up individual teams’ travel schedules and game density – both of which can affect players’ sleep and physical recovery – to come up with the forty-two games providing the biggest competitive disadvantage to one of the teams. The idea is to raise awareness about the importance of sleep to athlete recovery, but gamblers have also been cashing in on some of Mah’s predictions. Analysing more than 46,000 baseball games played over twenty years; it has been showed that the normal ‘home-field’ advantage was all but eliminated if the home team had recently flown more than two time zones east (and were therefore suffering from jet lag), and the visiting team was from the same time zone.(https://www.espn.in/nba/story/_/id/25...)Problems from high sun exposureJust as too little light is bad for our health, long summer days bring their own problems. Suicides, and particularly violent suicides involving hanging, shooting or jumping, peak in May and June in the northern hemisphere, and during November in the southern hemisphere. It is a seasonal pattern that has been demonstrated in numerous studies, across many different countries, from Finland to Japan to Australia. Generally, the higher the latitude of the country, the more suicides there are overall, and the greater the seasonal difference in suicide rates.Impulsive acts, such as assaults and murders, also increase as the days grow longer, and these are not likely to be connected to the general improvement in the mood of other people.One theory is that such actions are provoked by an increase in serotonin levels within the brain as the days grow longer. Although this may sound counter-intuitive because serotonin is usually associated with good mood, SSRI antidepressants, which similarly boost serotonin, are associated with a greater risk of suicide during the first few weeks of taking them. Usually, it takes three to four weeks for their mood-boosting effects to kick in; in the meantime, some people seem to become more physically active and agitated, which could make them more likely to act on suicidal or other aggressive thoughts.The long, light-filled summer days can also trigger mania in those who are susceptible to it. There is even some preliminary evidence that symptoms of mania can be improved by persuading people to remain in a darkened room between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m.The problems of prolonged exposure to bright light are perhaps most striking at the earth’s extremes: in Antarctica, sleep problems are so common that workers have their own name for the mild state of delirium they cause: ‘Big Eye’, insomnia caused by the Antarctic's 24 hours of summer daylight or winter darkness. It causes some of them to free-run, meaning that they become sleepy at unpredictable times, the cold can also make it difficult to fall asleep. Combined with the cabin fever brought about by spending weeks sheltering indoors from the harsh weather, this can fray people’s mental health to breaking point. Working close to the South Pole is also bizarre from a practical time-keeping perspective. There are no time zones because they all converge there, so the convention is to use the time zone of the country you arrived from. There are apocryphal stories of people completely losing the plot. One of them involves several people walking out into the darkness because they couldn’t stand it any more; in another, someone got as far as placing their head in a noose, because they just wanted it to end."

In Chasing the Sun, the writer has beautifully expounded that science tells us that when we remove the sun from our lives, both our physical and mental health can deteriorate with suffering from vitamin deficiencies and the winter blues are just a few of the sun-related issues that can affect us with sunlight-deprivation. The sun is much more important to our daily lives than you might contemplate. To begin with, it is responsible for synchronizing our circadian rhythms, which are responsible for coordinating many of the functions in our bodies. From allowing us to get a good night’s sleep to controlling when hormones are released, our circadian rhythms are central to our overall performance and health. The sun also gives our bodies much-needed Vitamin D and can influence our moods. Research into mental health has found that resetting our circadian rhythms can help manage chronic depression. Today, growing psychiatrists treat chronic depression and bipolar disorder with chronotherapy.  Schools and businesses around the world are starting to take our internal clocks more seriously. Take the suburb of Edina, Minnesota, for example. Many studies have shown that teenagers generally need more sleep than adults, and that they don’t perform well when they have to wake up early to make it to school by 8 a.m. or earlier. In Edina, multiple high schools shifted their start time from 7:20 to 8:30 a.m., and it proved to be an immediate success. Students felt less tired, got better grades, and attendance rates went up. Teachers like it too, saying the students seemed more attentive and engaged. In England, a comprehensive school for 13- to 16-year-olds, went from an 8:50 to 10:00 a.m. start time and saw a sharp reduction in absenteeism due to illness along with a significant increase in performance. Once I had read in another book that executives, managers and workers are more productive if they have sunlight through windows in their offices."

I would probably read just about anything related to these topics. This book reminded me of Underland in that I was expecting each of them to be much more scientific. They both turned out to be interesting science-y stuff with interesting travel and conversations. This book was watered down in both areas — science and travel. It didn’t really make it into either genre. Geddes says her first draft was much longer, and I think I would have enjoyed that more. There were so many instances in which she starts talking about some really compelling scientific study or historical event and then abruptly moves on to something else, only to briefly return to the first idea later (if at all). That made it disappointing. Also, the writing. There were so many confusing sentences. I don’t know if it was because the American publisher did not edit the book for an American audience, or what, but there were punctuation issues and really odd sentence structures. Maybe that’s how they write in Britain. I don’t know. It was quite distracting, though. Overall, I consistently found myself wanting more details about pretty much everything. Maybe it’s just that this field is so new and needs so much more scientific research. Good thing there are links to many of the studies used.For a more detailed look at specific practices to sync your different internal clocks I liked Change Your Schedule, Change Your Life.

I find it amusing that it is clearly written by someone who is more inclined to the night owl bio-rhythms than to larkishness. She stated often that it is important for everyone to be treated in a way that suits their chronotype and then says it is good whenever anyone moves anything later. As a lark reading this I found that created non-sequiturs a few times, I'm sure an owl reading it would be completely at home. None of that changed the fact that all the information in the book is excellent and well written and up to date and includes interesting examples from past and present. Very readable. Very enjoyable. Everyone in health or care system or looking after children should read this! Actually, everyone from anywhere would benefit by it, I think.One note: If I'm ever in hospital for any length of time, I think the most important things I could take with me would be a bright light and an eye mask for sleeping."

There were lots of references to studies done on mice etc, and various statistics. Nevertheless there were parts of the books which were very educational and broadened the mind such as how people who live in northerly latitudes cope with nearly 24 hours of darkness during the winter. I was interested to read the book as I have become aware recently how important it is to protect our circadian rhythms for our general health and well-being, but a lot of it is really just common sense.I have come to appreciate people who do shift work and how they put their health at risk. "
26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16268114-denise-chojnacki,3,"Why are people so drawn to the sun and is it really as dangerous as we are led to believe? This book addressed the sun's connection to our body's circadian rhythms and how it affects everything in our waking and sleeping life. Our health and performance at work is all touched by how our bodies respond to the daylight. Parts of this were really interesting while other parts seemed to drag on. Being a semi-sun worshipper, I appreciated the good feels for how sunlight is beneficial for us all but I never felt like I got good hard evidence. One of the other reviewers had addressed this and I passed it off, but there wasn't a lot of scientific support other than some random studies. Believe me, I was looking for more reasoning to back up my love of the sun! I did get some interesting tidbits though so it was worthwhile. "
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27569674-james,2,"It was OK. Parts of it were interesting. Others I found a bit dull and unnecessary, especially for a book on the science of sunlight. I would've enjoyed more science and less recounting of Geddes holidays to various sunlight-themed travel destinations. When the science was their it was interesting but as someone who has read 'Why We Sleep' by Matthew Walker (read it by the way it's really good) (also mentioned in this text and cited for further reading) a lot of it wasn't that new. Would've been better suited as an article with the fluff taken out. Or include more data and studies, etc. I don't regret the read, at least it was fairly short, (although it did take me a while to finish it admittedly) I wouldn't actively recommend it to anyone unless they were already interested. To which I would say ""yeah if you want *shrug*"". "
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19334047-ramona-mead,4,"This is a fascinating look into all the ways our lives are affected by the sun. I learned things about my body and modern lifestyle that I had never contemplated before. As a ""sun worshipper,"" I often have to defend my enjoyment of being in the sun. This book gave me a ton of information I can now use to educate others on the benefits of sunshine. But that's not all the author covers here. She goes into every aspect of human living, from eating to sleeping to travel, to work and school, to even how medicines work in our body, all in relation to the sun. It's dry at times, and dense with scientific language, though the author explains things well. I recommend it for readers of scientific non-fiction, and anyone who feels drawn to it based on the topic!"
29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12506326-aileen-noura-vitarelli,4,"The sun is more important to our daily lives than you may think. To begin with, it is responsible for synchronizing our circadian rhythms, which are responsible for coordinating many of the functions in our bodies. From allowing us to get a good night’s sleep to controlling when hormones are released, our circadian rhythms are central to our overall performance and health. The sun also gives our bodies much-needed Vitamin D and can influence our moods. Research into mental health has found that resetting our circadian rhythms can help manage chronic depression. Schools and businesses around the world are starting to take our internal clocks more seriously."
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2166338-amelia,0,"I heard this author on a podcast and wanted to learn more, so I checked out the book, but I'd really gathered most of the information in it from the podcast interview. There was more interesting information on the medical history of using sunlight as a cure, and plenty about SAD, from light therapy to cognitive behavioral therapy. Still, the biggest takeaway is simply this: Get outside during daylight hours. Keeping a strong circadian rhythm is good for you, and getting appropriate light exposure is necessary for that. "
31,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25211311-ann-della-bitta,5,"Very interesting investigation of how sunlight impacts our body and minds. Our internal clocks (Geddes points out that in addition to our master clock we have other more organ specific clocks) are driven by the intake of light. Light may impact our ability to fight off certain diseases, our mood and our sleep. Written using case examples and scientific evidence, this is a must read for sun worshipers. "
32,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99025751-christina-smith,2,"An interesting listen. I enjoyed the stories throughout the story and they did make me think. However, as I have been diving into many books regarding our circadian rhythm, daily schedules, and our relations to daylight I don't know that this would be one that I would first recommend. Several others do a much better job at making the information relate to the reader and give insight on steps to take to implement change into the readers life."
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3132060-andrea-james,4,4 stars because the book has prompted me to find out more about our relationship with sunshine and the outdoors in general. I'm not sure how much the studies cited have been replicated or what the cohort/sample sizes were etc. But there were interesting proposals that may be worth checking out. I'll research and report back (probably in a year's time) (maybe longer because I don't get enough sunshine or because I'm having too good a time outside).
34,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,3,"Sunlight = good. Get more sun. Unless you live in Australia, then get less. Get as much sun as you can without getting skin cancer. Spend time outside every day. Let the sunshine set your daily circadian rhythms.This book was more motivational for me than it was informative. The information felt quite straightforward, but as we approach the colder, darker part of the year, it is important to remember to spend time in the sun, despite the cold."
35,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63513223-katelyn-spencer,5,"I found this book very informative and interesting, It gave me great insight on why I should and how I can adapt parts of my week to increase my sun intake, especially in the early morning. Would recommend to anyone who deals with SAD, trouble sleeping, and/or those interested in learning more about our natural body rhythms! "
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49425611-farzad,5,"Aside, Chasing the Sun, mentioning researches into mental health that has found resetting our circadian rhythms can help manage chronic depression, the Daylight Saving effect was interesting to me. For a while I was looking for documents show that it cause disorders in mental health, which Linda Geddes mentioned in in the book."
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/836553-adrienne,5,"I've always known that sunlight was important to my mental well-being and that it affected some of our biological systems, but dang. This book goes into great detail about all of those mechanisms and exactly how dependent we are on light, and it outlines when and how much it affects different systems and processes so that we can try to structure our lives to maximize wellness. A life changer."
38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2109931-kimberly,4,"Really interesting read, especially right now in light of Covid19. This book also helped me realize something that I hadn't known about myself and my own sleep schedule since I always was the odd one out when it comes to sleeping times (I would usually fall asleep at 6 AM and wake at 1 PM, until I became a mom.) Really interesting read. Highly recommend!"

Turns out it’s crucial for sleep, moderating appetite, and regulating your immune system.Long story short, taking a morning walk in the sunshine does you the world of good."

42,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36839475-philippa-n,4,"This book covers more than simply how important the sun is for maintaining good health. It overlaps with Matthew Walker’s book ‘Why We Sleep’.Get outside as much as you can, turn off your screens in the evenings, and keep in sync with the seasons - your body will thank you for it in many ways!"

Not a lot of practical info, a lot of how things appear to be and where science is headed as far as uncovering our bodies’ relationship with the sun. "

In this book, Geddes clearly and simply outlines how sunshine impacts us, such as circadian rhythms, ability to heal, and more, interspersed with individual stories to further highlight these points. It’s a quick read at 200 pages."
