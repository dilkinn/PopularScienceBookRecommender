 Give yourself to the Dark Side. It is the only way you can save your friends. - D. VaderLisa Randall, a Harvard Science professor, member of the National Academy of Sciences, named one of the 100 Most Influential People by Time Magazine in 2007, and author of three previous books, likes to think big. She also likes to think small. Her areas of expertise are particle physics and cosmology, which certainly covers a range. The big look she offers here is a cosmological take on not only how it came to pass that a large incoming did in the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, but why such decimations of life on Earth arrive with some (on a cosmological scale) regularity. Her explanation has to do with dark matter. It makes for an interesting tale, and offers an excellent example of how the scientific method (how Daniel Day Louis might play Louis Pasteur?) approaches problem-solving. It is a fascinating read that is at times wondrously accessible and at others like trying to bat away a swarm of meteoroids. Dark Matter As with most good communicators of science. Randall relies on metaphor, and some of hers are quite good. My favorite compared methods of detecting dark matter to detecting the presence of [insert name of your favorite A-list celebrity here]. You can tell that there is something going on, without actually having to see the celebrity, because you can see swarms, gaggles, pods and packs of paparazzi clumping around the object of their lenses as he/she/it walks/primps/flees down the street. Dark matter affects the things around it too, and it is by measuring those effects that we can tell it is there, even though it remains...you know...dark. Lisa Randall - from her Twitter pagesShe addresses some cosmological questions and offers up the answers that the best current theories provide. One example is that the rotational velocity of stars should be sufficient to make them literally spin out of their galaxies, and yet they don’t. Something must be keeping them in place. Care to guess? There are more like this. They vary in Wow-Cool! levels. Randall takes us from a look at how we know dark matter is out there, and its characteristics, to an overview of our solar system. This is more interesting than a science class slide show of the 8 (or 9 if you are my age) planets circling around our sun. (Well, maybe I should say your sun, but I don’t really want to get into that) There is a lot of other material cruising around out there, and it is significant, as in Please, oh please, do not come crashing into our planet, pretty please.Path of the New Horizons spacecraft into the Kuiper Belt - from NASAThe Kuiper Belt, a group of clumped asteroids, not an award for the baddest Kuiper, and the Oort Cloud (not where Obchestvo Remeslenogo Truda keeps its data) for example, are parts of our solar system, and move through inter-stellar space along with the sun and planets. The Oort Cloud – From NASA You might think of the sundry members of the Solar System as a family all stuffed into one very, very large car of the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island. Once everyone is in, the whole crew moves through space (or circle in this instance) as one. But what if there were another Wonder Wheel, one that was made, not of the dense ordinary matter, but of the much thinner dark sort. Let’s say that it is not vertical but does its spinning thing at an angle. And let’s say it intersected our Wonder Wheel at one point. And every so often, say every thirty some odd million years, the car our solar system is in intersects the material in that other Wonder Wheel. The result could be unpleasant. The big stuff would probably be ok, our sun, the planets, but some of the smaller bits, say rocks in the Oort cloud and Kuiper Belt, might get knocked out of their usual paths. And voila! Fireworks! Big incomings headed our way yet again. Well, that’s the scoop. I am not giving anything away by laying it out. The value of the book lies in showing how theories are examined, tested and accepted or discarded, the scientific method in action.But I would not want to make you think the orbit you take while reading Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is all clear sailing. There are incomings you have to contend with. It always takes a bit more effort to absorb material when much of it is new to the reader, particularly when there are many new words, acronyms and concepts being thrown at you. I confess that there were points in reading this book when my eyes glazed over. It felt like I was reading a list in a foreign language. My mind went a bit dark in the chapter on how galaxies are born and in a couple of particle physics chapters near the end. On the other hand, enough of the early discussion of dark matter was utterly fascinating. When Randall writes of a second, post-Big-Bang expansion of the universe, it was news to me. I quite enjoyed the tour through our solar system, one that included parts we do not usually think of. And if you ever wondered about how three words are used, the answer is here. Meteors are what we see streaking across the sky. We call them meteoroids if they make it to the ground. (I hereby promise that no meteor will touch the Earth on my watch) In fact any alien object hitting Earth is a meteoroid. (Even Asgardians?) Meteorites are the detritus of meteoroid impact. There is a nifty piece on how we define what is and is not a planet, and some amazing intel on what unexpected materials asteroids and comets might have brought to the Earth over the history of our planet, and another piece on how craters are created. And did you know that there is a multi-national (as in countries not corporations) organization that was set up to watch the skies for the next big thing? These and more such nuggets make the journey with Randall worth the occasional eye-glaze. And if you are worried about The Big One wiping us out, don’t. We will see to that ourselves long before a big rock does the job for us. The current rate of species extinction is comparable to the one that took place 250 million years ago, the Permian-Triassic extinction. In that one 90% of species were wiped out, including insects. There is always hope that we will, over a period of millions of years, figure out how to keep large floaters from making a mess of our earthly garden. With Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs Lisa Randall, by striving to gain greater understanding of how the universe works, is doing her bit to shine a light in the darkness.Review posted – 10/30/15Publication date – 10/27/15=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s Twitter and FB pagesNASA’s Site about the  Kuiper Belt In 2010, the National Academy of Sciences presented their results on asteroids and the threats they pose in a document entitled Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation StrategiesA nice article in the June 2013 Smithsonian –  Lisa Randall’s Guide to the Galaxy An interesting set of videos with Randall on  BIG thoughts Although the interview is for a different book, Randall’s Daily Show interview with Jon Stewart is fun and informative re things scientific.Ditto, as Randall is  interviewed by Tavis Smiley A nifty set of videos on the  hazards presented by asteroids The Dark Song  from The Lego Movie - It’s Awesome"
1,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"Our Souls are DarkIt is an increasingly accepted speculation that souls might in fact be made of dark matter. According to our latest models, they (dark souls) condense first and allow life to settle down around them. Of course, they can't be detected since they are not detectable by ordinary matter science. On death, the souls depart from the body, and can go to heaven/cause rebirth via re-agglomeration depending on religious practices of the ordinary matter person associated with the soul. It is not yet fully understood how religious practices affect the dark matter core of a person. However, we do know that the souls get affected by a lifetime of sins, penance, charity, etc. It is accepted by now that no life can form without a dark soul though some scientists still like the older idea that a soul is required only for higher life forms, probably only humans. Lower life forms can agglomerate without the gravitational-religious pull exerted by the soul-core. The source of this mysterious force that is akin to gravity but applies only to life-forms is yet to be discovered. It is exciting to consider that life might be the only source of interaction between dark and ordinary matter, outside the even more mysterious realm of gravity. This allows us to speculate that ghosts might be real. In certain religions, certain required practices being not performed would mean that the soul-core is not fully freed from its person-form. This makes it unstable and dangerous, in a limbo state between dark and ordinary matter, and causes it to react in unpredictable ways with ordinary matter - sometimes violating the laws of ordinary matter physics. It is not entirely clear how this comes about. Dark matter souls normally interact with entirely new forces and particles that do not interact with ordinary matter. But it has been observed over time that religion can have an effect on this. It is a matter of great speculation how nature of reality is altered by the gravitational-religious forces that seem to transcend the dark-ordinary boundary and allow some diffuse interactions. A new temple is proposed to be built near CERN to test the interactions and to identify the carriers of these interactions. We anxiously await the results. We are also hoping to bump into a few celebrity souls/ghosts over there. It is a whole new world that awaits us!"
2,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I really enjoy science books that are well-written, by a scientist who has personally contributed to the field. This book certainly fits into this category, as Lisa Randall is a good writer. This book relates some of the research that she and her collaborators have been doing. Much of the book sets the stage so that lay readers can understand her speculative new hypothesis, and put it into perspective. Randall’s hypothesis is that dark matter is not exclusively arranged in a big halo around the Milky Way galaxy. There is a distinct concentration of dark matter in the central plane of our galaxy. As our solar system periodically oscillates up and down with respect to the central plane, it is especially perturbed by the concentration of dark matter. The period of this oscillation is about 32 million years. Comets in the outer reaches of our solar system are perturbed in their orbits. They are so far from the sun that a small gravitational perturbation can kick a comet into an orbit that intersects the inner solar system, in the vicinity of the Earth. One such comet collided with the Earth about 66 million years ago, creating a crater in Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula. The comet was 10 or 20 kilometers in diameter, and was responsible for the extinction of most of the living species on Earth, including the dinosaurs.Now, this hypothesis might be totally wrong. But, Randall explains how she tested it, and how a future spacecraft mission (GAIA) will provide additional experimental tests. In fact, the GAIA spacecraft mission will measure the positions and velocities of billions of stars in our galaxy. It is very fortuitous that the spacecraft was being launched at just the right time, and with exactly the purpose that will test Randall’s hypothesis. She notes how very lucky she is in this regard.The book reads a bit like a detective story. Lisa Randall takes the reader step by step through the process she and her collaborators took, to formulate and test their hypothesis. This is science writing at its best, because science is not a bunch of facts. Science is a process. And this book shows exactly how the process can work. Most notably, Randall shows how serendipity can often play a role in science. Fortunate coincidences can come together at opportune moments, guiding the research to productive results.Some reviewers find this book to be somewhat dry. I disagree; it is written in a straightforward style, with none of the cutesy stuff that some science journalists stick in to dumb down their books and .to bring in mass readership. That’s not to say that the book is devoid of humor. I got a big kick out of the photograph in Figure 35. I won’t spoil your fun by giving it away—you will have to read the book to see it!My only complaint about the book, is that its organization seems to be a bit strange at times. The full synopsis of the hypothesis does not appear until the very end of the book. I guess, that is how it was intended, sort of the denouement of a detective story. And, I was almost ready to write a scathing review, because a clear explanation of the hypothesis seemed to be missing from the book. But in the end, the full story is told, and it all makes sense. Also, I must remark that this book covers a broad range of fields; particle physics, astronomy, cosmology, and paleontology. I heartily recommend this book to everyone who is interested in learning about how modern science is really done these days."
3,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“What is the speed of dark?”- Lisa Randall, Dark MatterLisa Randall is smart. But she is also able to take topics that most people know very little about (dark matter, dark energy, etc) and translate the hard science into books for the unwashed masses. She's good. I believe part of what makes Randall one of a handful of our country's great public intellectuals is her ability to translate and to transfer her specialized knoweldge into books that are largely accesssable to the layman. Also, she is curious. Part of what makes her a phenominal scientist and not just a very good one, is her curiosity beyond her specialized career. She is a theoretical physicist, a cosmologists, a model builder who works well with other theoretical particle physicists and cosmologists. But she doesn't stop there. She is curious about biology, evolution, geology, politics, art, literature, etc. She is a connector. She jumps into fields and links things that might have been easily missed. She sees a periodicity in large meteor hits, makes an argument that links those asteroids to dark matter and builds a model to explain it. She isn't easily kept inside a box. Last year I was able to spend a couple days with her when my sister hosted her and some friends in Idaho for the totality. It was amazing to watch some basic standard physics (moon blocking the sun) with one of the most cited living physicists. I was literally in the dark with a dark matter expert.At first with the book, I wasn't sure where she was going. She obviously needed to lay some basic groundwork about how the univeres was structured, what dark matter was, etc., but then she jumped into a discussion of meteors and comets, mass extinctions, and then we were back to discussing dark matter. But she pulled it off. She carefully laid the table to explain the contributions she made concerning dark matter. One of the things I loved about her writing was she was constantly reinforcing the importance of science, EVEN WHEN IT IS SHOWN LATER TO BE WRONG. Randall loves the idea of science more than even her own ideas. It is easy to adore someone who humbles themselves to the possibility of their theory being wrong, and uses that to further embrace the scientific method. I guess I'll let Lisa have the last work to summarize this book:""This book is about the seemingly abstract stuff such as dark matter that I study, but it is also about the Earth’s relationships to its cosmic surroundings."""
4,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444651-david-katzman,2,"I quite enjoy reading cutting-edge physics books, particularly about the latest premises of quantum theory and cosmology. So I thought this was right up my alley. Turns out it wasn't my alley, it was a dead end. I did not enjoy Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: the Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe.I’m not a physicist but as long as you leave the maths out, I can follow most complex arguments. I got lost in the first half of DMATDTAIOTU. The first half of the book is primarily about why dark matter must (theoretically speaking) exist. I found that Randall makes way too many assumptions here to really understand her argument. She tosses off too many technical terms casually and proofs too convoluted for a layperson.At some point, Randall reveals that no one has yet observed dark matter nor do physicists KNOW WHAT IT IS. Most think it LIKELY to exist based on various observations of the behavior of the universe related to gravity and the spread of matter in the universe. Apparently, five-sixths of the universe is invisible, you see. The universe acts as if there is matter there, but it is utterly invisible to light. What could this be? Or, is it possible, scientists just don’t truly understand gravity yet to explain this effect? Here’s an article that explains all this much better, more clearly, and more concisely than Lisa Randall does: https://gizmodo.com/what-is-dark-matt...The second half of the book is around understanding the frequencies and trajectories of asteroids, meteoroids and comets. This eventually leads to the hypothesis, which is the central subject of the book. That if dark matter actually exists, it may perhaps form a particular disk like shape in the galaxy which when our solar system passes through it could trigger comets to break away from the distant Oort cloud far outside our solar system and dive toward or away from the sun and one of them hit the earth and killed the dinosaurs and most of the other life on the planet. This theory, by the way, is not only dependent upon the existence of dark matter and its hypothetical structure, but it’s also dependent on another very hypothetical assumption, that of the periodicity of comets breaking off from the Oort Cloud.The theory that the dinosaurs were killed off by a comet strike is fairly well-settled science, although still having many unknowns. But you can read about the Chicxulub crater here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxul..., which has all the hallmarks of a major comet strike 65 million or so years ago, which coincides with the dinosaur's extinction.That said, Randall’s concept relies on a theory on top of a hypothesis on top of a theory on top of a hypothesis. Yes, there is science behind the premise of dark matter. But very little known beyond that right now. The entire book seems far to premature to have been published conceptually but seems to have made it to press due to the sexiness of the premise…dark matter killed the dinosaurs.Even if her theory has merit, DMATDTAIOTU is just downright boring. Not recommended."
5,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,2,"Adapted from the Literary Review:This book comes garlanded with tributes, headed by the claim “Only Lisa Randall can take us on such a thrilling scientific journey.” I beg to differ. Off the top of my head, I can think of half a dozen science writers who could do a better job of describing this particular scientific story (and some of them have covered almost all of the material presented here). The clue is in the words “science writers”. Randall fits into as particular niche which has recently become over-full. She is a world-renowned scientist, in her case based at Harvard University, and wrote a splendid book about her own area of expertise, Warped Passages. So far, so good. But since then, like others in a similar situation, she has strayed, or been encouraged to stray, authorially, into territory outside her own specialist area, territory that is already better covered by writers who understand science but, at least as importantly, are gifted communicators. George Musser, in her homeland, and Brian Clegg, on this side of the pond, are two that spring to mind. If it were not for her academic status, Randall’s latest book would pass by as just another rather humdrum account of the origin and evolution of the Universe (and probably I would not be reviewing it). Its only claim to be special is a rather desperate one – the tenuous titular link between dark matter and the fate of the dinosaurs, which is no more than a highly speculative variation on an idea that has been around for decades. That idea is that as the Solar System bobs up and down on its route around the Galaxy, and repeatedly crosses the disc of the Milky Way like the needle of a sewing machine bobbing up and down through a piece of cloth, gravitational forces shake loose comets from the region known as the Oort Cloud, far beyond the orbit of Pluto. Some of these comets fall inward towards the Sun, where they may collide with the Earth, with devastating consequences. The idea is based on some rather dodgy statistics linking alleged periodicities in so–called mass extinctions of life on Earth (including the death of the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago) with the periodicities associated with the bobbing movement of the Sun in its orbit around the Milky Way. The statistics are made no less dodgy by Randall’s wild suggestion (even Randall herself calls it “a speculative scenario”) that a layer of dark matter within the galactic disc, like the meat in a hamburger, is what provides the gravitational tug that shakes the comets loose. This does, of course, provide an ideal opportunity to discuss the nature of dark matter, and its role in the evolution of the Universe. But any scientifically aware person must by now be familiar with the idea that the kind of stuff we are made of (in essence, atoms) makes up only a small proportion of the matter in the Universe, so that stars and galaxies are embedded in a sea of invisible dark matter, which interacts with our kind of stuff only through gravity. Anyone who has an interest in cosmology also knows about dark energy, and the discoveries about the cosmic background radiation recently made by satellites such as NASA’s WMAP and ESA’s Planck. Randall covers all this, and a discussion of the Solar System and our place in it, in workmanlike fashion. But workmanlike really isn’t good enough, when the stories have been covered so often, and so well, already. I quite like the personal vignettes, such as Randall’s description of meteor watching in the Rocky Mountains. But these ought to be the icing on the cake, not the highlights, of a book like this. Even the discussion of dark matter is over-familiar, except for the minor (and unconvincing) twist in the tail. A bit less than the last quarter of the book actually addresses the topic of the title (I’m being generous; arguably less than half that) and a large chunk of this is taken up with telling us, with commendable honesty, about all the uncertainties in the claim. Dinosaurs sell books (as do cats), and I don’t blame Randall for trying to sex up her subject. But all the new and interesting (though probably wrong) stuff here could have comfortably been encapsulated in an article for Scientific American. Who might benefit from the book? A complete newcomer, maybe the proverbial teenager who as yet knows nothing about the Universe and the place of the Earth in space. Who will be disappointed by it? Anyone interested in dinosaurs. And what should the book have been called? The Speed of Dark, as any Terry Pratchett fan could tell you. It would not be fair to say that I am disappointed by the book, because I had low expectations. But it is fair to say that those expectations have been fulfilled. The real disappointment is that if she had not been busy writing this very average account of the Universe, Randall could have been concentrating on her research, which really is thrilling. There is an expression about cobblers and lasts which is apposite."
6,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Randall offers an exotic hypothesis to explain the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. She argues that the solar system passing through a disk of dark matter in the galactic plane perturbed Oort cloud objects resulting in a large comet crashing into earth. She admits the theory is highly speculative and says her real purpose is to share the underlying science. To make her case she ties together diverse scientific disciplines including cosmology, particle physics, astronomy, geology and paleontology. Randall starts by taking us through the formation of the universe with an emphasis on the role of dark matter. Dark matter interacts with ordinary matter and itself solely through gravity as far as we know. There is five times as much of it as ordinary matter and it is critical to the structure and arrangement of galaxies. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is a disk 130,000 light years wide and 2,000 light years thick. It resides in a spherical halo of dark matter that extends 650,000 light years across. The sun lies 27,000 light years from the center and circles the galaxy every 240 million years.Next Randall digs into the Solar System’s structure describing the categories, compositions, distributions and behaviors of planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, meteoroids, dust and especially comets. Short period comets (less than 200 years) may be guided by the Kuiper Belt but originate in the Scattered Disk. The Kuiper Belt is the region beyond Neptune. Neptune is 30 AU from the sun. AU stands for Astronomical Unit, the distance from the center of the earth to the center of the sun. The Kuiper Belt is a doughnut shaped area containing dwarf planets (including Pluto) and smaller icy bodies extending out to 55 AU. Past that, out to 100 AU, lies the much more sparsely populated Scattered Disk which also has minor planets and icy bodies. These frozen gas bodies can become comets when perturbed from unstable elliptical orbits. Long period comets (more than 200 years) originate in the Oort cloud, which extends from 1,000 to 50,000 AU from the sun, almost a light year. The Oort cloud is too far away to observe so it is considered hypothetical. The Oort cloud extends to the end of the Sun’s gravitational ability to hold objects. Such lightly bound objects are easily dislodged from their orbits. Meteoroids and dust regularly enter earth’s atmosphere. Larger asteroids and comets are less frequent but far more significant. The largest recorded event in 1908 in Russia was from a 50 meter wide object that exploded with the equivalent of 10 to 15 megatons of TNT or about 1,000 times of the Hiroshima bomb destroying 2,000 square kilometers of forest. Randall identifies 26 impact craters formed in the last 250 million years that exceed 20 kilometers wide indicating events resulting in global damage. Since the earth is 70% ocean and erosion and other factors hide craters, many more have occurred. Randall explains the methods geologists use to determine that a crater has an extraterrestrial cause.Randall describes the ways paleontologists reconstruct the past to determine that a mass extinction has taken place. There have been five big ones since the rapid rise of complex multicellular life 540 million years ago. The biggest was 250 million year ago, the Permian-Triassic event which killed off 90% of species. Fifty million years later another event enabled the dinosaurs to take charge and then 66 million years ago another event eliminated them and paved the way for us mammals. Today we are on the brink of a human caused sixth extinction. The Cretaceous-Paleogene event of 66 million years ago that killed off the dinosaurs was caused by a comet. Randall explores the years of detective work by geologists that went into proposing and then confirming this. The impactor hit at the edge of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico leaving a crater 150 kilometers in diameter. This 10-15 kilometer wide object traveling at 20 kilometers per second released an energy equivalent of 100 trillion tons of TNT, a billion times more than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Tidal waves and seismic waves rippled around the globe. Poisonous fumes filled the atmosphere. Fires broke out everywhere followed by a global winter from an atmosphere filled with debris blocking the sun’s rays. Birds, burrowing mammals and some other fortunate species would hang on to survive. Randall examines the proposals that these impact events occur more frequently at regular intervals and settles on a period of 32 million years. To support her theory Randall explores current ideas for dark matter. The most common is WIMP, Weakly Interactive Massive Particle. The LHC (Large Hadron Collider), which successfully found the comparably massive Higgs boson, has been unable to find these proposed additions to the Standard Model. Another is Asymmetric Dark Matter which like WIMPs allows for a small yet to be detected interaction with ordinary matter. Another candidate particle is the axion which has already been suggested to solve other problems with the Standard Model, but none have been detected. Other ideas such as neutrinos or simply unseen ordinary matter such as mini black holes have been pretty much disproven. Randall highlights the many ongoing experiments that place detectors deep in the earth to block out interference so that the weak interactions of these particles might be recorded. Randall looks at how well dark matter’s gravitational influence lines up with the universe’s galactic structure. She notes that the distribution of dark matter in dwarf galaxies and galactic centers is less than predicted. She claims her hypothesis that a small percentage of dark matter interacts with itself, mimicking at least partially the behavior of ordinary matter, explains these anomalies. The WIMP theory holds that the dark matter particle is much heavier than a proton. Randall uses this in her model to support her “partially interacting dark matter” forming a disk in the galactic plane that is 100 times thinner than that formed by ordinary matter. This is key to its periodic disruptive gravitational impact on the Solar System’s Oort cloud. Unlike the wider galactic plane of ordinary matter in which the solar system always resides, the solar system moves in and out of the dense dark matter disk as it weaves up and down in its orbit around the galaxy. The gravity of this thin dense disk would be enough to perturb Oort objects sending some towards earth. This movement of the Solar System ties to Randall’s periodicity of 32 million years. The Solar System entered the proposed dense dark matter disk two million years ago, add in two complete cycles, and you are at 66 million years ago.So what are we to make of this bizarre theory that makes unsupported assumptions about the nature of dark matter; particularly that at least some of it must interact with itself in order to form the proposed disk? Randall is careful to craft her model so that it conforms to known measurements, but this hardly makes it true. It’s a big stretch. We could call it a shot in the dark. But to me the real value of the book is not in the theory, it is what I learned as Randall took me through the science she used to build it. I learned a lot about dark matter, even if I still have no idea what it is. I learned how it influences the structure of ordinary matter. I learned the many theories and experiments underway to uncover its nature. I gained a new appreciation for the entirety of our Solar System. I now visualize the entire Solar System including its far flung halo of Oort objects moving through the galaxy. Before, I just pictured the planets revolving around the sun. And even if dark matter was not the trigger I find it fascinating that our presence on earth has been determined by an object coming from a part of the Solar System that has never been observed."
7,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3246379-j-d,5,"I have read previous books by Lisa Randall, and liked them well enough, but her new book is in some sense unique, and extraordinary. In order to show us how she has come to think that there’s a connection between galactic dark matter and Earth’s periodic extinctions (a somewhat long-shot hypothesis) she takes us in an amazing tour of our Solar System and the universe, like no other science-for-the-layperson book has ever undertaken. It’s both a look at how a scientist deeply thinks about ideas and a master class in science.For most of the book, Randall has transformed herself from a physicist to an astronomer and geologist and evolutionary biologist, and effortlessly teaches all of us about the wonders of the universe. Even for a jaded College professor and regular reader of this lore (I have taught College Physics, Biochemistry, Cellular Biology and Human Physiology and Anatomy for most of my life) there are here lots of discoveries—and a pervasive, subtle humor—that enlivens what could have turned into a dry discussion of geological eras, meteorites and the like, and the biological underpinnings of evolution. There’s even a bit of fun about “Jurassic [sic] Park” and “The Big Bang Theory”.This book has been an enjoyable surprise to me—hadn’t liked that much “Knocking on Heavens’s Door”—and it places Randall right up there in Carl Sagan’s territory. A terrific Good Read."

I'm afraid I understand only half of the book completely - the rest was an exercise in futility. However, it seems up-to-date and on the cutting edge of theory as much as a non-scientist reader like myself, who reads pop science magazines, can comprehend! National Academy of Sciences member Lisa Randall's book was published in 2015. 'Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs', one of many books she has written, recognized for their quality in describing the high-end science Randall is exploring, is a thorough physical forces walkabout on the creation of the Earth, the solar system and the Universe as only someone who has studied theoretical particle physics and cosmology at Harvard University can do it.While I did not see any mathematical equations in the book, her explanations are based on deductions from sussing out the science from the mathematics which describes how the universe functions, and the almost understanding of how it all started, and brief descriptions of how particles, atoms and elements interact combine and separate to illustrate the why of scientists' deductions, along with graphs that chart and examine the measurements taken by various high-tech instruments and low-tech satellite cuties scooting around in the Solar System.Whew! The amount of detail and facts this woman must be able to juggle in her head while drinking coffee must be astronomically huge! Literally!I suspect the book is a wonderfully enlightening read, but due to the low wattage of my brain cells, I can only say I enjoyed the challenge of reading it. I was able to pick out bits which echo what I've been reading in articles which talk down to readers, but Randall's explanations filled in many blanks for me.I recommend reading this in-depth book - several times....Check out this superior review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...: )"
9,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153787-geevee,3,"Fascinating, intriguing, thought-provoking yet also confusing and complicated.Lisa Randall has done a good job of taking a very complex subject and helping folk like me to understand the science, theory and conjecture.It is, as she says, a theory but one she ably links the connection and influence of dark matter (not dark energy, black holes or anti-matter) to the extinction of the dinosaurs.There were, it is true, parts of this book I had to re-read and also just recognise I didn't understand, but it is a book doing a good job of simplifying some serious science and maths."
10,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Randall is the first to warn her reader that her new hypothesis is speculative and in need of more testing. However, she is excited about the kinds of questions this new direction is taking her. Randall has been investigating how dark matter might be involved in not only the creation of matter itself, but possibly in the evolution of humans as well. The presence of dark matter is not at all speculative. It has been detected using a variety of tools and methods. What is speculative is the notion that some dark matter might interact with itself. Just as ordinary matter comes in different varieties (different sizes, charges, etc) dark matter too might come in different varieties, some of which might not make a halo, but rather a dense disc that cuts through the the Milky Way and provides an extra gravitational force that might throw a comet off its trajectory and allow it to plunge toward and into earth, thus changing the temperature and atmosphere of Earth. Randall has a mixed style of writing. At times she makes analogies that are so fantastic, they seem among the best I have read. At times though, her writing is dry. For example, I found the chapter on Cuvier (who I actually love) and catastrophe to be so dry, I had trouble paying attention. But, her chapters on the structure of the universe-- how matter was formed, how matter collapses into a disc, how clumping follows the rich get richer power laws,how heavy elements actually help in cooling so that large objects like our sun can form, etc-- were actually page turners for me. I reread some of those sections more than once because they were so exciting. One of my favorite parts of the book was her discussion of Occam's Razor. She prosed a table setting around core function. It was brilliant. Also wonderful, she treated her reader to a version of human's are not special that went way beyond most things associated with the Copernican revolution. She suggested that matter, everything we have ever seen in the universe, is not special. So great to be reminded of that. I actually laughed audibly while reading that section. I cannot wait to see what the telescope Gaia finds. Of course I am hoping it will support Randall and Reece's hypothesis. If it does not, I am still excited to continue hearing about the questions that continue to drive Randall's work. "
11,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,2,"I picked this up after NPR's ""Science Friday"" recommended it. I found it diffuse. Which is odd given Randall's core thesis -- that science is exciting when findings from one field cross-fertilize an unrelated field... and positively amazing when that feedback loop can illuminate other features of the original subject. The problem is, Randall does a ho-hum job connecting her research as a particle physicist and cosmologist studying dark matter to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Instead, the proposed connection seems tacked-on. Randall's overall aim in ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" is, to her credit, captivating. Central to the book is illustrating how connections work in science using her own work in dark matter. And how exposure to and observation from one field -- paleontology -- suggested to Randall and a colleague a possible solution to the apparent ""periodicity"" of large meteor strikes like the one in the Yucatan that led to the demise of the dinosaurs. Cool. Sounds creative and fertile. But it just didn't congeal. All in all, a noble effort. Since Randall is trying to generate buzz by piggy-backing her core work on particle physics on a super-popular topic, dinosaurs. But she fails to make the connections juicy enough. Worse. Randall's prose is bloated. Bottom line: Randall is a brilliant physicist. She is trying to popularize a field that is hard to popularize. But she needed an editor -- to make her prose and content tighter. "

And the day she decided to write this book, a meteor burned up in Earth's atmosphere. Fortuitous timing? For humans on the brink of a possible 6th extinction, possibly not.But also, it's hard to say ... because ... we're still in the dark. About many things, primarily, dark matter.Dark matter is quite the enigma. Who can say what it is or what it does? Randall does a great job of presenting facts and science. Aside from the two personal tidbits I shared above, this book is largely devoid of character and strictly scientific analysis. A little dry, and very ... transparent. Straightforward without a lot of flim flam. Sometimes science writers can get too wrapped up in dumbing down their work for the common man, or adding extraneous elements such as humor to their approach (*cough* Mary Roach *cough*), not so Lisa Randall, which I actually appreciated.""Dark matter is not dark—it is transparent. Dark stuff absorbs light. Transparent things, on the other hand, are oblivious to it. Light can hit dark matter, but neither the matter nor the light will change as a result."" Informative, interesting, but also largely speculative.It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't exactly a gripping read either. Don't expect much in the way of dinosaurs either, they didn't appear until the very end of the book. Full review to come???"

I appreciated the honest candor with which Lisa Randall writes. She talks of wrong paths taken, and of right paths taken that came by pure chance. You can hear the true 'scientist' in her voice - ""show me new data and we will adjust our scientific theories"".I need to now go back over all my pencil marks and make a powerpoint presentation for my HS Physics classes that I teach.I greatly appreciate such readable material on the 68% of the Universe that we cannot see - Dark Matter."

You see the game is important! So...1). Imagine a new kind of matter, which is invisible, omnipresent and makes up everything you do see aka normal, mundane, everyday matter! 2). Now continuing our little game of imagination further on, let's have our entire solar system like other star systems out there be surrounded by a dark matter field. 3). But sadly the majority of dark matter is really too cool and hip to interact with lesser objects like everyday matter, however, 5% of them do so. And that 5% of interacting dark matter form clumps with local matter like badly whipped potato spuds. Now the climax (Dun, dun, dunnnn!!! ) -  What if those potato spuds like clumps of the local matter then get entrapped in a solar gravitational field and become meteors, which then crash on earth to kill those mean-looking dinosaurs??? Mind blowing stuff isn't it! I had to read Calvin & Hobbes while downing whisky shots, just to steady myself and realise that even a puny Calvin, asks more profound questions than someone with a PhD degree. The summary of this 350+ page,unimaginative book is -  Everything is Interconnected because of dark matter . Sigh!My Rating - 1/5 (Garbage bin)PS - Puns aside, please readers find something else from the popular science trolley to read than this atrocity! Better yet, read Calvin & Hobbes"

Some rollicking good information, with clear explanations about extinction, the structure of the solar system, comets, and galaxies. She's best when she gets to particle physics and dark matter. While the science is fantastic, interesting and well informed (as an evolutionary biologist I noticed a couple of glitches, nothing wrong, just misleading), but the very best part of the book is explaining how science is done. She goes through some of the best writing I've seen on the inception of ideas and how those are turned into hypothesis driven science and then how those are turned into theories and tested. She walks us through this process with such care and insight I was stunned with the clarity of detail that she approached it. I teach a class on the philosophy of biology and I'm going to have the students read these descriptions. An amazing book in every way. I not only wanted to give it five stars, but to shout hooray. "
16,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"Sixty-six million years ago another day dawned over a Cretaceous earth. Life was carrying on as normal, but everything was about to change because heading towards the planet at an astounding speed was a ten-mile wide object. The impact of this object left a crater, traces of which can still be detected and managed to obliterate the dinosaurs and 75% of all the other species on the planet. The few that survived evolved into the huge variety that we have today and provided an opportunity for the mammal to thrive. It is now thought that this was not one of those, one in several million chance events, rather an effect of our solar system interacting with the wider universe and the gravitational influence of dark matter. Randell has some interesting theories about dark matter, the pervasiveness of it in the universe and how the gravitational influence of dark matter causes disturbances in our galaxy and solar system. It is a substance that we know is there, but at present, we have no idea where it is, what it is or how to detect it. Quite elusive stuff, especially given how much of it there is out there. Randell writes with clarity on a difficult subject, although it is occasionally incomprehensible; but that is as much because I am fairly rusty at physics, rather than her explanations. She is well qualified to talk about this being Professor of theoretical particle physics and cosmology at Harvard, but this is one book that might be beyond the general science reader, even though they should probably give it a go."

I just ran out of time on the library book and realized that I'd need to buy a copy. This isn't the sort of thing you just rush right through. It's necessary to chew over some of these strange things that we are apparently surrounded by and composed of and that pass right through us all the time. It's not the kinda thing you should necessarily read while trying to fall asleep. This is too complicated for a sleepy brain. Then on the other hand, you don't really want to dream about this stuff. Yunno. Think about it. Like, you might not come back from your trip way out there or down there. This is nothing to trifle with.However, Lisa does a wonderful job writing this all down for the rest of us. Thanks so much for this monumental effort. Also, her astrophysics jokes are stellar! I think this is the kind of book you would want to read with your morning coffee--forget Facebook and the news. Then after, you can have a little nap while it all settles into place. After which you'll be ready for a nice day working in the garden or the woodshop.Cheers! Y'all and keep looking UP!Jim in MT"
18,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3623644-marilyn-b,3,"I read this in support of my Grade 8 son who for some unknown and incomprehensible reason was assigned this as his year-long inquiry “novel” for English class. He struggled along with it for a couple of months until I couldn’t take his moaning and whinging about it anymore so I sat down to read it in the hopes that I can decipher it for him. Well. I almost need someone to decipher it for me! And I’ve taken two years of university-level physics and one astronomy class so I’m not a complete neophyte. And yet, this is a lot of deep thinking over the formation of the universe and all and sundry that came from that including dark matter. Don’t get me wrong some of the information is interesting and certainly new to me. I had no idea that dark matter was anything more real than the sci-fi multiverse-causing stuff of novels and movies. But apparently it is real. But sometimes Lisa Randall writes in a way that only theoretical physics folk could get. For example when she says that the best evidence of dark matter is gravitational lensing measurements I didn’t immediately say to myself “ah yes, of course!” Because I have no direct relationship to that type of measurement. The best bit of info - for me - is that I’ve been calling meteors the wrong thing all along. Meteors are the visible tails of light that we see when a meteoroid is falling through the atmosphere. And if a meteoroid actually hits the Earth it’s now called a meteorite. As for my son? Well. I’ve summed up what I think I understand about what I read and he’s now back in his room working on essay #1 about this work. Good luck to him."
19,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,4,"Did dark matter cause the demise of dinosaurs? In this book entitled, “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe,” Harvard University Professor Lisa Randall proposes a very speculative idea that the mass extinctions of dinosaurs that occurred 65 million years ago was due to an impact of a comet dislodged from its orbit around the solar system. It’s a tall claim with no experimental support, but the book offers alternative explanation for a seemingly slam-dunk debate. Her original research paper appeared in on online journal at: arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576. The theoretical assertion is that dark matter can clump up into a thin, flat disc in the Milky Way Galaxy’s plane, and as the solar system orbits the center of the galaxy, it oscillates up and down on a regular cycle, and it would pass through the dark matter disc every 35 million years. Such an event is likely to dislodge comets orbiting the solar system and shoots directly towards earth. Though dark matter is estimated to account for 85% of total mass of the universe, these particles are not yet detected since they do not interact with the visible matter. However their presence is explained through their gravitational influence in clusters of galaxies. They also reside in spherical “halos” around galaxies. Professor Randall suggests that a fraction of dark matter also experiences a force analogous to electromagnetism, which she calls “dark light.” Through its interactions with “dark light” this weird subset of dark matter could form an invisible disk that overlaps with the visible disk of spiral arms in our Milky Way galaxy. This dark disk might have interrupted the orbit of a comet on the outer fringes of the solar system, sending it on a collision course with earth approximately about 70 million years ago. She observes that the crater record on Earth indicates nonrandom impacts at regular intervals of approximately 35 million year periodicity. The sequence of events connecting dark matter to demise of dinosaurs is very slim: We still need to define the identity of dark matter and whether there is a pattern to comet strikes on Earth. The earth is regularly impacted by asteroids more than comets, and secondly, in the recent history of earth, giant planets like Jupiter has watched over earth like a big brother and kept earth out of harm’s way by gravitationally pulling many comets. The Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 hit Jupiter in July 1994, and in Nov 2013, comet ISON hit sun head-on bringing its own death. Thus we have Sun and Jupiter to watch over earth. In addition, one needs to distinguish earth craters formed by comet and asteroid impacts. Recent studies have suggested that the asteroid that hit Yucatan Peninsula 65 million years ago also intensified volcanic eruptions in the Deccan Plateau in South Asia. Volcanic eruptions became twice as intense, throwing out a deadly cocktail of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The shockwaves produced at this time shook up earth and its volcanic “plumbing systems” around the world, creating larger magma chambers that spewed out more material. This cataclysmic event also deprived oxygen in oceans thus killing thousands of aquatic species. This “combined effect” is now believed to be responsible for wiping out dinosaurs. But Professor Randall’s proposal suggest that dinosaur demise occurred 70 million years ago, thus introducing a large discrepancy between theory and factual observation. Other possible experiments to prove this hypothesis is that we need to look for the presence of such a disk in Milky Way by studying the gravitational effects on other stars in the galaxy. The recently launched Gaia telescope will map the motion of a billion stars in our galaxy, and this study may reveal the presence of dark matter disc. Professor Randall’s proposal has more questions than answers, but it is certainly a fascinating theoretical idea. "
20,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15736187-robert-gustavo,2,"Overall, I don't think Dr. Randall has the skill as a writer to pull off a pop-science book like this.The level of the material is all over the place -- and given the breadth of the material, it is bound to be all over the place for most readers -- and she has done a poor job of explaining what needed to be explained when the material was new to me, and keeping me interested when the material was not.For instance, there are statements like this: ""The percentage of energy in dark matter is about 26 percent, in ordinary matter about 5 percent, and in dark energy about 69 percent."", which leads me to wonder about the energy in ordinary energy (if that even makes sense) and want to understand what the relationship between dark matter and dark energy is. But it either isn't explained, or isn't explained well. A definition of energy might have helped too.And then long sections on dinosaurs which are at a 6th grade earth science level, and which drag on forever, and where Dr. Randall sticks in anecdotes about rock climbing. The dinosaur chunks are not her area of expertise.There are also some truly terrible analogies, like having ordinary and dark matter be NPR listeners and Fox News watchers, which have minimal overlap and interaction. There are also digressions into public vs. private ownership of craters, and Citizens United gets a few mentions. And more rock climbing. Dr. Randall also has a tendency of repeating things again and again in slightly different words -- I'm not sure if this helps people understand things or not, but it can get tiresome once you understand something. Also, rock climbing. She keeps sticking in anecdotes that are more about her than the science. If the rest of the book was better written, I don't think it would have annoyed me, but it was like someone screaming ""I'm personable!"" over and over.The underlying science is interesting, but the book itself was a painful slog to finish. I don't think I will read another book by her unless she is collaborating with someone who is a better writer (which I wish she would do, since the science around dark matter is interesting)There was one spot where a paragraph ends in mid-sentence, which"
21,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,2,"I was hugely disappointed by this book. I was led astray by the words ""astounding interconnectedness"" in the title. Do you remember the 1970s series Connections?. In it James Burke links together a whole bunch of developments and changes in technology, climate, finance, politics, geography, and social organization, to show the way ""history"" is an intricate web in which every affects everything else. Bill Bryson does the same thing in his beautifully readable A Short History of Nearly Everything. From the title I was expecting a book with this same approach. Instead I got a stock standard explanation of what is undeniably cool science, but there was literally nothing in here that was new, and the contents weren't presented in a new way, or exploring new contexts.It didn't help that I didn't like Randall's voice.I am a sad bunny.1.5 stars"
22,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,4,"2nd book for 2017. The central thesis of this book is mostly probably wrong, and it doesn't matter.In this book, Randall puts forward the argument that as our solar system passes through the central plane of the Milky Way galaxy every 30-35 million years, it passes through disc of dark matter, which leads to gravitational disruption of the Oort (comet) cloud at the edge of our solar system, leading some comets in the cloud hurtling towards the Sun and (occasionally) impacting with the Earth. The part about the dark matter disc is highly speculative (there is lots of evidence for dark matter, but few people believe in a dark matter disc). There is not very strong evidence for periodic extinction events caused by comets (the demise of the dinosaurs is obviously a singular event, and the evidence for regular comet impacts is sketchy). But who cares? Randall writes beautifully about both dark matter and demise of the dinosaurs, as well as much in between (the creation of the Universe, the solar system, the impacts in general). "
23,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"I will read this book again. Randall brings out a very interesting point that has been lifted to be the title statement. She does the usual summarization of the development of the universe but with an emphasis on dark matter -- commonly given little or no consideration in most texts. She then describes dark matter, differentiates it from dark energy and black holes, and talks about it's place in the universe. Note that most of this is based on predictions and hypothetical information gleaned from observations. Her writing is largely a compilation of research both of her own and of others. She is careful to attribute all ideas not her own to those researchers. Her analysis of the research is the critical mass of the writing. I found this fascinating, but my memory requires another read.She takes the reader through the history of dinosaurs early in the book. It is not until near the end that she clearly ties the dark matter possibility with their extinction. Ferreting out that possible relationship was a monumental task with much creative and analytic thinking. She describes her group that worked on the project and the methods they used to come to their conclusions. As a true scientist, she carefully stays within the bounds of their work and does not claim a major truth. She leaves open the opportunity for other scientists to disprove her work.Her story is interesting but I also enjoyed her careful explanation of her process."

You wanna get to the marrow, read or listen to the last two.Doctor Randall is knowledgeable, thorough, daring, imaginative, a respected scientist... and the worse science-popularizer I've read. How you can take such an intriguing topic as dark matter, marry it to such an exciting one as dinosaurs, throw in Chicxulub, Tunguska, Meteor Crater and other meteoritic visitors, and still manage to turn this book into a vat of molasses, is something of an achievement.I finished it only because I am afflicted with obsessive-compulsive disorder and it is physiologically impossible for me to start a book and not finish it. And a good thing that is, because I can say that, despite Doctor Randall's shortcomings as a transmitter of ideas, I loved reading about the Oort cloud, a topic that I will certainly explore more. I am also supremely grateful to this book for mentioning Walter Álvarez, whose research I will read forthrightly. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands dark matter is impossibly boring and much of what's written about it boils down to how easy it is to not find it.The woman reading the book, Carrington McDuffie... I loved her. But she was not enough to lift this slog from the ground."

Though she admits quite openly the extremely hypothetical nature of her theories, she still makes a good case for the interconnectedness of dark matter with regular matter events that could be experienced on Earth."
26,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34731823-jim-heter,5,"I've been reading a new book called Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs by Lisa Randall, Professor of Particle Physics and Cosmology at Harvard.Here's my take-away from that. (The speculation is my own, not hers.)The Edge of Our ExistenceReach out and touch something. Go ahead, do it. Not mentally or figuratively, but literally, really. Done that?You just reached through space that is 26 orders of magnitude more nothing than something. Space is far more empty than we realize. We are told that air has a density of 1.275 kilograms per cubic meter of space. But that is in terms of mass. In terms of space, the matter in air occupies about 10^-26 cubic meters per cubic meter. Far more nothing than something.Not only that, but the solid matter in the things you touch typically occupy not more than 10^-22 cubic meters of matter per cubic meter of the space they occupy. Barely distinguishable from air. We are made of almost nothing.This is not news.Experimenters learned this over a hundred years ago.More recently, though, researchers have shown that the nothing we occupy is a little less empty than we believed.In fact, there is five times as much other stuff than our stuff, occupying the same space we do. Not too surprising that it can do that, given the numbers above. There’s plenty of room for it.This other stuff is called “dark matter.” Maybe you've heard of it.The word “dark” means we can't see it.We can't feel it either. Can't touch it at all. That's why no one knew it was there. That is, until astronomers figured out that something was missing from their picture of the universe. Something they can't see is holding it all together, making a kind of gravitational scaffold that keeps the stuff we can see in place.So far, that's about all we know.That's the edge of our existence.The edge of what we know is not out there some billions of light years away.It's right here, around us, inside us. Everywhere.Beyond the edge is what we don't know.But we can speculate.And being who and what we are, we do exactly that.Here's a start on the speculation.Cosmologists started out by assuming (hoping) that the “matter” in dark matter was all the same, something simple that was affected by gravity but not by anything else. (They want simple ideas, because that makes their job a little easier.)This didn't quite work out. But that's about as far as they have gone with it. They are busy making more careful measurements of the effects they can detect. That's not an easy business, in fact it's very difficult and slow. So part of the effort is to come up with better ideas of what dark matter might be, so they can know what they are looking for. Now you may also have heard of something out there called “dark energy.” That is something else, pretty much unrelated to the dark matter question. It is just raw energy that is spread out evenly throughout space, very thinly, at such a low level that it too (like dark matter in this respect) is impossible to detect except on a cosmological scale. But it needs to be there to explain the observed rate of expansion of space. For comparison, we could talk about energy density. The energy density of actual matter (not the space in between) is about 6 × 10^17 kg/m^3. Pretty dense. This is what we might call nuclear energy, the energy bound into the “solid” part of atoms. If that nuclear energy was spread evenly over the space it occupies, it would be only about 10^-5 kg/m^3. Not so impressive. But still, to convert that nuclear energy to free energy by Einstein’s equation, you would have to multiply it by the square of the speed of light. You would end up with...a lot. But if all the energy that is bound up in normal matter was spread out evenly throughout all of space, it would account for about 5% of the total energy. Another 25% would be the dark matter. The rest (70%) is dark energy.Okay, that pretty much covers what is known or thought about dark matter by the scientific community.Here's a little unscientific speculation. The cosmologists say there is five times as much dark matter as what we call “normal” matter. And they are at least beginning to suspect that it is not all the same. So it is inviting to imagine that it could be divided up into five different types, each one corresponding to ours in its own fashion, so that along with ours there are six overlapping worlds, each one far more nothing than something, occupying only about 10^-22 cubic meters per cubic meter of their common space, so there is plenty of room to move around in and remain all mutually imperceptible by any form of physical interaction except for gravity.What could that mean?People have long speculated about alternate realms of existence: heaven, hell, dreamland, spirit worlds. Could some of them be real, right here sharing the same space with us, perhaps even accessible to us in some limited way, if not physically then mentally, psychically, spiritually?If so, it could begin to answer some questions that are not just cosmological. It could make room for some old answers that we've been trying to ignore. Room for elves, unicorns, dragons, goblins, all the creatures of our imaginations that we most fear or fancy. It could mean that some of our most hard-headed scientists are now telling us that we must make room in our minds for an unseen something that shares the very space we live in. Not something in another galaxy far, far away, but right here, just beyond the edge of our existence.Do you have a problem with that?"
27,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"Spellbinding Account of Cutting-Edge Physics, Astrophysics and GeologyNoted theoretical and experimental physicist Lisa Randall offers a spellbinding account of her current research into dark matter and how it relates to other cutting-edge science in astrophysics and geology in her latest book, “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe”. This is a riveting exploration into how science in done, describing in ample detail not only her research, but also notable ones from paleontologists, planetary geologists, and other geologists pointing to the likely culprit for the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction (66 million years ago). The “Great Dying” that wiped out nearly two-thirds of Earth’s biota, not only the non-avian dinosaurs, but also other terrestrial organisms and those dwelling in the late Cretaceous oceans, ranging in size from relatively miniscule single-celled planktic foraminifera to titanic mososaurs resembling the one in the film “Jurassic World”. An extraterrestrial culprit, a comet, its motion disturbed enough by unseen dark matter, altering its remote Oort Cloud orbit into one spelling doomsday for much of Earth’s biota.As the subtitle of “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe” suggests, Randall covers much ground in her lucid explanations of relevant aspects of cosmology, planetary geology, paleontology and particle physics, frequently relying on pop cultural and political references recognizable to American readers. She literally boldly goes where no one else has gone before in her informed scientific speculation, proposing that a unique form of dark matter was responsible ultimately for the great K-Pg – for Cretaceous/Paleogene – mass extinction. Dark matter which may explain why geologists and especially, paleontologists, have observed cycles within the stratigraphic and paleontological record, approximately 32 million years in length, that have some correlations with higher rates of extinction on a regional, if not global, scale. As a former invertebrate paleobiologist, I am surprised and delighted by Randall’s coverage (Chapters 11 and 12) of the five great mass extinctions during the Phanerozoic Eon (the interval of geological time that began approximately 540 million years ago and continues to the present.); it may be the best I have seen so far in a popular science book. She also excels in explaining how a new, catastrophic, view of Earth’s geological history has supplanted a more traditional, uniformitarian, gradualist view championed by geologist Charles Lyell that had its most notable expression in Charles Darwin’s version of the theory of evolution via Natural Selection, which remains the core of the Modern Synthesis (current) evolutionary theory in biology.Randall stresses repeatedly the importance of scientific teamwork, noting how the extraterrestrial agent for the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction – a comet - was identified by teams of geologists and astrophysicists, most notably the University of Arizona planetary geology research group led by Bill Boynton and his graduate student Alan Hildebrand, which stumbled upon the Chixculub impact crater off the coast of Yucatan, Mexico, starting with studying the stratigraphic record in relevant rock formations in Texas and Haiti, pointing to the existence of the impact structure. She also describes clearly how University of Chicago paleontologists David Raup and J. John Sepkoski recognized the existence of the five great mass extinctions, proposing an extraterrestrial impact of an asteroid or comet as the “smoking gun” for the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction. She concludes with an almost memoir-like recounting of the history behind her research team’s work on dark matter, offering evidence and well-reasoned scientific speculation pointing to the existence of a new form of dark matter. If for no other reasons than these, Randall’s explorations into how science is being done in astrophysics, particle physics and the geological sciences demonstrate why “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs” is a notable new book of popular science, and one of the most notable new works of nonfiction published so far this year."

29,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23389225-seashore,5,"This is a very informative read.1. Dark matter is an invisible substance that scarcely interacts with the rest of the universe through any force other than gravity. Whatever dark matter is, astronomers have inferred there is quite a lot of it by watching how large-scale structures respond to its gravitational pull.2. Dark matter seems to constitute almost  85 percent of all the mass in the universe, and it is thought to be the cosmic scaffolding upon which galaxies coalesce. Many theories, in fact, call for dark matter concentrating in the central planes of spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way. Our solar system, slowly orbiting the galactic core, periodically moves up and down through this plane like a cork bobbing in water.3. In 2014, the author Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece showed how the gravitational pull from a thin disk of dark matter in the galactic plane could perturb the orbits of comets as our solar system passed through, periodically peppering Earth with giant impacts. This dark-matter disk has to be thin, about one-tenth the thickness of the Milky Way’s visible disk of stars, and VERY dense. 4. Randall's study is the periodicity of impact to the Earth and another Scientist, Rampino, researched the clumping of this Dark Matter (Not new stuff) that will hit the Earth and get to its core causing volcanic eruptions ripping apart continents, altering sea levels and change the CLIMATE! This is ATTACK from below.5. Meanwhile, from above, comets are pounding down on the solar system- The result is mass extinction.6. An oscillating bobbing solar system crossing the Milky Way- A comet existing far away might feel this disruption and at the same time the overheated Earth's core is sizzling due to the  Dark matter clumps  that entered and are waiting to erupt- Can this truly happen? What a hypothesis that's causing immense controversy. From above and also within the EarthThe author, Lisa Randall lists the many craters that abound the Earth. One of the largest in the US is the Barringer Crater  located in Arizona, 1200 metres across and 170 metres deep. Barringer actually bought the property after doing research on the crater and his company now charges $16 to see it. The meteorite that formed the crater was of nickel and iron and analysis of the scattered fragments indicates meteor, not volcano.Barringer, already wealthy from his silver mining, spent 27 years drilling deeper into the crater looking for iron from the meteoroid that hit the Earth, not knowing that on impact, the meteorite vaporizes. So, he lost $600000. Not until 1960, was the crater impact fully understood. Scientists have analysed the results of the impact on the craters in Navada as well as many others across the Globe.The Flysch Geopargue in Spain is quite a wonder to see with its 60 million year span of rock formation. Randall includes a picture in the book, on pg 327. The impact is like a nuclear blast. interesting. The hit, compression, decompression, and the outflow of the shock wave all happen within a few tenths of a second! But then the changes - the after effects are slow. More recent are craters in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada and South Africa.Thinking of Dark matter has led the author to study our Galaxy which led her to learn more about our Solar System, about comets and hence the extinction of Dinosaurs and also to think about life on Earth as it is today.This is a good book and smooth reading; one that you might want to reference from time to time."
30,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
31,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
32,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
33,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."

The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."

As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
36,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
43,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
44,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."

By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not.

The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."

If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process.

She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected.

54,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."

While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
56,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
57,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
58,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
59,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
60,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
61,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
62,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
63,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."
64,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63655371-ben,3,"This book was an interesting assembly of the theories that drive the periodicity of meteoroid strikes (such as the Chicxulub impact which killed the dinosaurs) and that of Dark matter investigations. The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."
65,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649671-jean-paul-keulen,2,"I give up. As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
66,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
73,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
74,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."

By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not.

The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."

If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process.

She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected.

It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
85,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
86,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
87,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
88,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
89,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
90,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
91,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
92,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
93,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."
94,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63655371-ben,3,"This book was an interesting assembly of the theories that drive the periodicity of meteoroid strikes (such as the Chicxulub impact which killed the dinosaurs) and that of Dark matter investigations. The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."

As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
96,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
103,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
104,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."
105,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85201000-noah-coriarty,5,"The book Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs by Lisa Randall informs the readers about what dark matter is, its properties, its discovery, its influence in the universe, and its relation to the dinosaurs. By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not.

The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."

She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected. And there are few guides better to the process than Randall."
114,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
115,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
116,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
117,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
118,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
119,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
120,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
121,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
122,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
123,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."
124,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63655371-ben,3,"This book was an interesting assembly of the theories that drive the periodicity of meteoroid strikes (such as the Chicxulub impact which killed the dinosaurs) and that of Dark matter investigations. The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."

As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
126,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
133,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
134,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."

By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not.

The first part of the book, discussing the evolution of the Universe, is absolutely superb. The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."

If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process. I know that I learned more about space, physics, and paleontology than I ever imagined knowing in life, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become familiar with the inner workings of the solar system.

143,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30469739-nick-mclean,4,"Lisa Randall takes readers on a fascinating tour through the history of the universe, planet earth, astronomical science, geology, and paleontology. She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected. And there are few guides better to the process than Randall."
144,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
145,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
146,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
147,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
148,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
149,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
150,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
151,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
152,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
153,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."

The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."

As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
156,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
163,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
164,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."
165,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85201000-noah-coriarty,5,"The book Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs by Lisa Randall informs the readers about what dark matter is, its properties, its discovery, its influence in the universe, and its relation to the dinosaurs. By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not. I recommend this book to anyone who gets the chance to read it as it has influenced my image of the universe greatly. "
166,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,3,"Randall is a particle physicist and a cosmologist, and it shows. The first part of the book, discussing the evolution of the Universe, is absolutely superb. The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."

Lisa Randall's proposal is not only groundbreaking, but it's told in such a thorough way that regular readers can form their own opinions about it. The author left no stone unturned, delving into history, math, physics, and astronomy in a completely immersive way. If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process. I know that I learned more about space, physics, and paleontology than I ever imagined knowing in life, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become familiar with the inner workings of the solar system. A solid 5 stars for keeping my interest all the way through."

Before doing that, however, Randall reviews the cosmology of matter moving through the universe, the history of that particular impact event and the evidence we have supporting the theory, as well as current thought on dark matter. Whatever you think of the final connection, those are all interesting and worth reviewing. "

173,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30469739-nick-mclean,4,"Lisa Randall takes readers on a fascinating tour through the history of the universe, planet earth, astronomical science, geology, and paleontology. She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected. And there are few guides better to the process than Randall."
174,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
175,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
176,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
177,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
178,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
179,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
180,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
181,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
182,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
183,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."

The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."

As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
186,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
193,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
194,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."
195,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85201000-noah-coriarty,5,"The book Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs by Lisa Randall informs the readers about what dark matter is, its properties, its discovery, its influence in the universe, and its relation to the dinosaurs. By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not. I recommend this book to anyone who gets the chance to read it as it has influenced my image of the universe greatly. "
196,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,3,"Randall is a particle physicist and a cosmologist, and it shows. The first part of the book, discussing the evolution of the Universe, is absolutely superb. The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."
197,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52974236-bobbi,5,"Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs was a mind-blowing glimpse of the surroundings that we never see. Lisa Randall's proposal is not only groundbreaking, but it's told in such a thorough way that regular readers can form their own opinions about it. The author left no stone unturned, delving into history, math, physics, and astronomy in a completely immersive way. If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process. I know that I learned more about space, physics, and paleontology than I ever imagined knowing in life, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become familiar with the inner workings of the solar system. A solid 5 stars for keeping my interest all the way through."
198,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"As promised, this book connects a certain theory of dark matter with the movement of comets and meteors, and finally with the impact event that lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Before doing that, however, Randall reviews the cosmology of matter moving through the universe, the history of that particular impact event and the evidence we have supporting the theory, as well as current thought on dark matter. Whatever you think of the final connection, those are all interesting and worth reviewing. "

203,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30469739-nick-mclean,4,"Lisa Randall takes readers on a fascinating tour through the history of the universe, planet earth, astronomical science, geology, and paleontology. She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected. And there are few guides better to the process than Randall."
204,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
205,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
206,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
207,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
208,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
209,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
210,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
211,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
212,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
213,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."

The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."

As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
216,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
223,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
224,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."

By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not. I recommend this book to anyone who gets the chance to read it as it has influenced my image of the universe greatly. "
226,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,3,"Randall is a particle physicist and a cosmologist, and it shows. The first part of the book, discussing the evolution of the Universe, is absolutely superb. The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."

Lisa Randall's proposal is not only groundbreaking, but it's told in such a thorough way that regular readers can form their own opinions about it. The author left no stone unturned, delving into history, math, physics, and astronomy in a completely immersive way. If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process. I know that I learned more about space, physics, and paleontology than I ever imagined knowing in life, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become familiar with the inner workings of the solar system. A solid 5 stars for keeping my interest all the way through."

Before doing that, however, Randall reviews the cosmology of matter moving through the universe, the history of that particular impact event and the evidence we have supporting the theory, as well as current thought on dark matter. Whatever you think of the final connection, those are all interesting and worth reviewing. "

She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected. And there are few guides better to the process than Randall."
234,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
235,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
236,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
237,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
238,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
239,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
240,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
241,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
242,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
243,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."

The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."

As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."

She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
253,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
254,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."
255,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85201000-noah-coriarty,5,"The book Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs by Lisa Randall informs the readers about what dark matter is, its properties, its discovery, its influence in the universe, and its relation to the dinosaurs. By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not. I recommend this book to anyone who gets the chance to read it as it has influenced my image of the universe greatly. "
256,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,3,"Randall is a particle physicist and a cosmologist, and it shows. The first part of the book, discussing the evolution of the Universe, is absolutely superb. The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."
257,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52974236-bobbi,5,"Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs was a mind-blowing glimpse of the surroundings that we never see. Lisa Randall's proposal is not only groundbreaking, but it's told in such a thorough way that regular readers can form their own opinions about it. The author left no stone unturned, delving into history, math, physics, and astronomy in a completely immersive way. If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process. I know that I learned more about space, physics, and paleontology than I ever imagined knowing in life, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become familiar with the inner workings of the solar system. A solid 5 stars for keeping my interest all the way through."
258,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"As promised, this book connects a certain theory of dark matter with the movement of comets and meteors, and finally with the impact event that lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Before doing that, however, Randall reviews the cosmology of matter moving through the universe, the history of that particular impact event and the evidence we have supporting the theory, as well as current thought on dark matter. Whatever you think of the final connection, those are all interesting and worth reviewing. "
259,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755381-mark,4,"Astonishingly brilliant and accomplished in several scientific disciplines, physicist Lisa Randall seems like she is a good teacher but is a so-so writer. Her interesting thesis here comes wrapped in a bunch of tangential padding."
260,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23570713-elizabeth,1,Just not my cup of tea - pitched for a different audience.
261,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47269270-kelly,2,"Sadly, this just wasn't my thing. To be honest...I was SO damn bored. "
262,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"A good book by someone at the forefront of dark matter research. It dragged a bit for me at times, mostly because she goes over things I am already familiar with, but that's not her fault or a shortcoming of the book."
263,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30469739-nick-mclean,4,"Lisa Randall takes readers on a fascinating tour through the history of the universe, planet earth, astronomical science, geology, and paleontology. She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected. And there are few guides better to the process than Randall."
264,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
265,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
266,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
267,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
268,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
269,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
270,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720868-seth-d-michaels,4,"Terrific tour of the latest ideas in physics about the evolution and structure of the universe and how it relates to the history of our solar system and life on earth. The centerpiece is Randall's theory about how dark matter in the galaxy could cause gravitational disturbances that could result in comets like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Highly recommend if you have interest in how theoretical physics works and how a physicist thinks. The most interesting part for me is in the middle of the book, where she talks about the extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm just old enough that when I was a big dinosaur nerd as a little kid, ""what happened to the dinosaurs"" was described as a distant and maybe never-to-be-solved mystery, but by the time I was old enough to check back, the comet-strike explanation was as clear and concrete as a scientific theory can be. In one chapter, Randall explains how scientists figured this out over the 80s and 90s and it's honestly riveting (at least to me). It's a great case study in how science works. Randall is very good at explaining very abstract, complex subjects, although there's a limit to how well you can do this - there were things I had to skim over, as there were with her last book Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. Dark matter is very hard to get your head around because its defining feature is that it interacts barely at all with normal matter and normal light, so we can't really see it even though there's actually more of it than there is of normal matter. The theories about what dark matter is are head-hurty abstract and the descriptions of how scientists try to detect it are a little numbing and technical, so those are the parts I skimmed. Still, I love Randall's attitude, her enthusiasm and the ease with which she walks the reader through the incredibly weird/cool work she does as a physicist. "
271,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,4,"I really loved this book! Lisa Randall is a brilliant cosmologist, and she explains a subject so thoroughly, even though dark matter is something so incomprehensible for so many people. The only 'uneasy' feeling I had about the book is the extreme between the simplistic and the complex. Here's what I mean by that: though I am not a physicist, I have read plenty of books like this one, so my level of knowledge is definitely beyond rudimentary. In almost all her chapters, she starts off with very rudimentary things, such as the number of planets in our solar system, the composition of the sun, etc...and as the chapter goes on, she switches, somewhat abruptly, to things like dark matter and other aspects of physics and cosmology that are unknown to us mere mortals. At times, I was torn between considering this book to be tailored to a complete physics novice, and then at other times, to a very seasoned scientist who should have at least a very thorough understanding of our universe. I guess, selfishly, I would have liked her to have expounded more on the aspects of dark matter and better explain that part of her work, rather than explaining the ""simple"" things I have already learned a long time ago. But, I have to understand that she wanted (probably) this book to appeal to novice and an ""expert"" alike. Also, there were some editing issues in the book. Whoever was supposed to proofread it didn't do a good job. On one page, the entire half a sentence is missing- kind of like a cliffhanger almost! It was exciting... I guess?Overall, I loved the book and would highly recommend it. And I love Lisa Randall :) The woman kicks ass. "
272,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"This fascinating book explains everything you ever wanted to know about the universe but were afraid to ask. Lisa Randall skillfully avoids the untestable questions of first cause and fundamental asymmetry by focusing on what scientists know for sure. The light from the Big Bang expansion is clearly evident in the night sky, where the quantum irregularities have expanded to elephantine size. Prior to that, a period of cosmological inflation in the first fraction of a second caused an exponential expansion of a relatively simple, homogeneous universe smaller than a grain of sand. The author goes on to explain the step-by-step formation of clusters of matter into the galaxies we see 13.8 billion years later. She details the evolution of our own solar system and gives the reader a clear sense of the continually dynamic universe in which 85% of gravitational matter does not interact with light. In later chapters, the author explores the five major extinctions of life on planet Earth, including in great detail the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a 10 km. wide meteoroid exploded on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and immediately killed almost all the biomass on the planet, the source of our “fossil fuels” today. Lisa Randall's ultimate goal is to tie speculative theories of dark matter with the measured periodicity of the crater record, and she presents an elaborate case that will be tested in the near future. "
273,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626294-david-jordan,4,"Lisa Randall, who is a skiing enthusiast in addition to being a highly respected particle physicist, tells a story in her new book about a friend who skis only occasionally and describes his attempts to improve as ""two steps forward, two steps back."" The author graciously says that the effort to learn and her friend's presence on the mountain is progress in itself, regardless of how much skill is (not) gained during the attempt. What an apt metaphor to describe my efforts to understand concepts like cosmology, dark matter, and any other area of specialization that Professor Randall teaches in this impressive book. She does a great job in the opening chapters of laying a scientific foundation that even a dolt like myself can follow, but by the end of the book I could barely grasp the complex concepts of the final chapters. I will just have to take her words to heart, and accept that my effort to understand her theory about how dark matter may have influenced the cataclysmic event that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs is progress enough. Who knows? Maybe I am just a little bit smarter for having read an amazing book about a fascinating theory written by a brilliant scientist and talented writer."
274,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63655371-ben,3,"This book was an interesting assembly of the theories that drive the periodicity of meteoroid strikes (such as the Chicxulub impact which killed the dinosaurs) and that of Dark matter investigations. The historical aspects covered and the physical basis were indeed intriguing and pose some interesting questions going forward.However, I must admit the book lost me for several chapters in the middle as it struggled to find the balance between pertinent concepts surrounding the subject matter and the technical details of hardcore theoretical physics. There were times when it felt like the same ideas were being paraphrased over and again with increasing complexity and convolution, as well as a promise that it will ""all make sense"" later in the book. While the final chapters did make good on this promise, I feel that the book spent too much time hinting at the end (then going off on a tangent about elementary particles) than actually communicating the interconnectedness of it all.That being said, the book was enjoyable for me."
275,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649671-jean-paul-keulen,2,"I give up. As a science writer specialized in physics and astronomy *and* as a big fan of Randall's first book, Warped Passages, I really wanted to (and expected to) read this book cover to cover. Unfortunately, there are just too many chapters containing stuff I already knew before the idea the title refers to is finally discussed. Now, usually I can deal with books like this one - but Randall talking about asteroids, comets et cetera couldn’t keep my interest. It's not that the book is written badly, but there’s a certain spark missing. It doesn’t seem like the author is dying to tell me tons of exciting new stuff. Instead, she seems to have diligently collected information on everything that is remotely connected to the subject matter, in order to be able to write a book just as big as her first two. Well, I guess she succeeded - but I would have preferred a much shorter book."
276,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50786017-sue,1,"I liked the last chapter but found getting there was s.l.o.w. She goes over a lot of material that even a third grader probably knows but throws in a fact or two once in a while. Some of the 'facts' she states are disputed, although she often acknowledges that some of her ideas are not universally accepted. The book needs an editor. There is even one sentence on (I think) page 216 that is a fragment. She, like many authors, seems to be in love with her own prose to the detriment of anyone trying to gain knowledge from reading 'scientific' literature. I think this book, cut WAY down, would have made a good article for a magazine such as Smithsonian but would not pass peer review for anything more rigorous."
277,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2656837-katie-lind,4,"I enjoyed the broad scope of the science, from geology to galaxies and everything in between, and how it eventually coalesced into her main thesis. Even without her main idea, it's pretty remarkable how things in the universe fit together, and how different branches of science are so intertwined.My only real gripe is that the writing sometimes felt a bit rough draft-y and conversational, though maybe that was intentional, and it never really got in the way of my enjoyment of the book."
278,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7201754-wanda,4,"Worth reading even if just for the overview of the theory of how the universe was formed and the conjectures about the nature of dark matter. But, be warned, it's quite the understatement when author Lisa Randall writes, ""Without some background in particle physics... these ideas can be difficult to grasp..."" I struggled and gave up on more than a few."
279,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52059897-jor,5,"This book is a real ode to curiosity. It made me want to be a scientist and feel bad for not appreciating science lessons in school.

 What a catchy title! I have always wondered where we are. No, really think about it. Where is the Earth? Where is the Milky Way? Where, and yes I know it is in space, but where is space? For these questions, I almost was expelled from 5th grade… because nobody could tell me and every day the teacher would ask, “Any questions?”I listened to Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe because I didn’t think I could actually read it and you have to listen to something while you are driving, right? I have to say that now I know that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t get it and in fact, NOBODY really knows or understands. Even Randall lets the reader know immediately that she’s proposing an explanation for mass extinctions, not the explanation: “I’ll tell you right up front that I don’t yet know if this idea is correct.” If this educated, HIGHLY EDUCATED woman can’t tell me where dark matter, which by the way isn’t dark and is actually transparent actually is… then I don’t guess I will ever understand WHERE WE ARE… but I know it is related to the fact there are no more Dinosaurs. I do know the difference between cosmology, and cosmetology now. I enjoyed her explanation of planetary science, and earth science, and scientific mystery.I kinda understood how the solar system is linked to killing the dinosaurs, but the link to dark matter was not transparent to me, mainly because nobody really knows if it actually exists. Suffice to say that WE REALLY don’t KNOW… but I assume we will continue to try to figure it out. While my review is a bit tongue in cheek, I did find the book fascinating and I enjoyed it a great deal. But I hope she can figure it out before we hit another condensed glob of dark matter that forms a disk (I imagine this is something like a pothole) and bounces the gravitational pull of the Sun when it passes through the plane as it circles the Milky Way enough to perturb the Oort Cloud and rain comets into the inner solar system, causing impacts like the one that killed off the dinosaurs.If you try this book, don’t give up before the end.. because the last part of the book is the best… Randall does an amazing job of trying to explain it for the everyday guy and while I still don’t exactly understand the concept of infinite, I at least have a better idea of space. GREAT JOB Dr. Randall. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
283,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,2,"This was an informative and mostly engaging book that uses a tongue-in-cheek title (and honestly the main reason I bought the book) to discuss deeper issues about the structure of the universe itself. The main contention of the book is that due to the nature of dark matter, it forms vast ‘discs’ in space that permeates our own galaxy. The book contends, although admits that at present there is insufficient evidence to prove, that this vast mass of dark matter exerts physical forces on the space around it in a similar, although potentially complete different, manner to that of the normal matter we are all familiar with. Thus, and again it admits there is no real evidence in favour of the assertion, it is possible that the comet that lead to the destruction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, was due to a icy stone ball being nudged out of its regular orbit due to our solar system passing through the dark matter disk permeating the universe. It is indeed an engaging idea and Lisa Randall does an excellent job of making really big and complex ideas about the structure of the universe relatively accessible. (I must admit that one of the main take-aways I personally had from the book was that dark-matter and anti-matter are indeed different entities, as I had always fudged the two in my own mind - I am thankful to her for clearing this up for me). I do however have a few reservations about the book. Firstly, a lot of the assertions, as alluded to above, are not wholly based in fact but in conjecture - not necessarily a total fault as it makes the book far more entertaining than it otherwise would be. Secondly, the book seems to be slightly premature: Randall admits herself that many of her assertions don’t have any evidence at all until a NASA project takes more accurate measurements of the universe (this is happening within the next 5 years so perhaps she could have waited for a bit more evidence before publishing). My main criticism, however, was some of the writing-style throughout large chunks of the book. As she herself points out, her book is an ambitious attempt to apply her theories to the grand structures of the universe. Her sections on dark matter are a pleasure to read and the clarity of thought around them shines through. She is, by her own admission however, a particle physicist and not a cosmologist, and I’m afraid this really does come across during the quite considerable sections concerning cosmology, where she seems to adopt quite a listless tone that makes it a bit of struggle to maintain concentration while reading it. I would however still recommend this book somewhat, perhaps leaving aside the cosmology chapters, as it does make you think about our solar system in non-conventional ways, I just wish she’d written it slightly better and had a bit more evidence for her arguments."
284,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969595-john,4,"What a fascinating topic. As Carl Sagan said (to paraphrase): ""Wow...the Universe is F%$@ing HUGE""I have been looking forward to delving into this book since its publication, and it did not disappoint. There is a LOT of information packed into this book, a LOT. It is possible that there may be too much information. At times it reads a little too much like a textbook. Every sub-topic is backed up with as much supporting information as a reader would ever need. The thoroughness is certainly impressive.So, the question is...who is reading this? If it is a lay person with no history of reading about cosmology, then they'd appreciate the primer info about the surrounding science. However, they might also be in over their heads during the more dense discussions. If the reader is someone already knowledgable about cosmology and particle physics, they will likely be bored having to sift through Space-101. Maybe the author could have some of the science-class background stuff as foot notes or end notes?IDK...I think the author tried to straddle the fence as to who the reader should be. But, these are just critiques about form. Regardless, the book stands as a remarkable body of research and work by Lisa Randall and her colleagues. I'm sure i will want to go back several times to cross check a few hundred facts that i want to remember."
285,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85201000-noah-coriarty,5,"The book Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs by Lisa Randall informs the readers about what dark matter is, its properties, its discovery, its influence in the universe, and its relation to the dinosaurs. By describing what we know about dark matter, she was able to relate it to other things, one being dark energy. She compares and contrasts dark May her to dark energy as well. The main theme of the book is how dark matter influenced the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. This book does not have a specific main character or setting, along with any conflicts, as it is a science based book, which is all theoretical and has not yet been proven.Personally I loved this book. The amount of information that I gained from reading this book is ineffable. I have always enjoyed physics and the history of animals, especially dinosaurs. Learning about people’s theories of the correlation between dark matter and the extinction of the dinosaurs is always very interesting, and needless to say entertaining. I have learned many things about physics from this book, such as the fact that our universe is almost completely made up of dark matter, and that the universe could not sustain itself without dark matter.I believe those who learn because they want to should read this book, especially those interested in science. I read it because I am very interested in every scientific field. I found this book very intriguing, and i don’t see why anyone else would not. I recommend this book to anyone who gets the chance to read it as it has influenced my image of the universe greatly. "
286,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,3,"Randall is a particle physicist and a cosmologist, and it shows. The first part of the book, discussing the evolution of the Universe, is absolutely superb. The third part of the book, against all my expectations, left me less incredulous about the existence of the dark matter disk (I went from ""There's no way this could be right"" to ""I guess this is not inconsistent with our current lack of data"".) But the extinction and paleontological parts of the book felt meandery, and sometimes like they were cobbled together from Wikipedia articles. And the fact that the author is so candid about the poor quality of arguments regarding the periodicity of impacts and extinctions, which is the whole link between the dinosaurs and dark matter, made the inclusion of that material even worse.In sum, a really great (like, really great!) book about dark matter and the Universe, marred in my opinion by a poorly-justified and worse discussion of dinosaurs and extinctions."
287,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52974236-bobbi,5,"Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs was a mind-blowing glimpse of the surroundings that we never see. Lisa Randall's proposal is not only groundbreaking, but it's told in such a thorough way that regular readers can form their own opinions about it. The author left no stone unturned, delving into history, math, physics, and astronomy in a completely immersive way. If you really pay attention, it's a riveting read, and it might change the way you think about the Earth in the process. I know that I learned more about space, physics, and paleontology than I ever imagined knowing in life, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to become familiar with the inner workings of the solar system. A solid 5 stars for keeping my interest all the way through."
288,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"As promised, this book connects a certain theory of dark matter with the movement of comets and meteors, and finally with the impact event that lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Before doing that, however, Randall reviews the cosmology of matter moving through the universe, the history of that particular impact event and the evidence we have supporting the theory, as well as current thought on dark matter. Whatever you think of the final connection, those are all interesting and worth reviewing. "
289,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755381-mark,4,"Astonishingly brilliant and accomplished in several scientific disciplines, physicist Lisa Randall seems like she is a good teacher but is a so-so writer. Her interesting thesis here comes wrapped in a bunch of tangential padding."
290,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23570713-elizabeth,1,Just not my cup of tea - pitched for a different audience.

292,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"A good book by someone at the forefront of dark matter research. It dragged a bit for me at times, mostly because she goes over things I am already familiar with, but that's not her fault or a shortcoming of the book."
293,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30469739-nick-mclean,4,"Lisa Randall takes readers on a fascinating tour through the history of the universe, planet earth, astronomical science, geology, and paleontology. She is a beautiful writer and offers readers a great education. The book resembles a scientific investigation. As she slowly unravels her thesis, she takes us on a voyage through history. Randall creatively structures the book like a story, it reminded me somewhat of Richard Dawkins The Ancestor's Tale The book covers the beginning of the universe, the nature of matter, the formation of the earth, extinction events, particularly the one that occurred about 66 million years ago that wiped out our predecessors on this planet. Randall holds that an interstellar object (likely a meteorite) passed through a double disk of Dark Matter and was diverted and sent hurtling towards earth, precipitating a catastrophic climatic event that exterminated most of the dinosaurs. Her intriguing speculation is introduced the way a mystery writer unravels a whodunnit. Her obvious enthusiasm is demonstrated on every page, and one begins to understand that the scientific method itself is a kind of adventure, where the process of formulating hypotheses, gathering evidence and forming a conclusion. I particularly enjoyed her section on how scientists reached a consensus around extinction of the dinosaurs. It's clear that all discoveries are massive collaborative projects that involve people from disparate disciplines coming together. Science is wonderfully interconnected. And there are few guides better to the process than Randall."
294,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"A science book for laypeople sounds like something I might like and, I must admit, I did enjoy Lisa Randall’s Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs tremendously. It would have been even better if I knew more about particle physics (or physics in general for that matter). In Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Lisa Randall, Professor of Physics at Harvard University and one of the world’s most prominent working scientists, proposes that the object that descended from space to crash into Earth, killing the dinosaurs, sixty-six million years ago was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter embedded in the Milky Way.The hypothesis fits into a single sentence, and yet Lisa Randall takes her time to get to it. The end product is a very big book. Although I liked her storytelling and some of the metaphors were wonderful, the whole book might be a bit too long: Lisa Randall lays down a decent scientific foundation in the first 20 chapters of the book, and then summarises her hypothesis in a single chapter. The scientific foundation, decently laid out as it is, was still difficult to follow in places.Dark matter? Dark energy? Dark matter vs. antimatter? Dark matter and black holes? Oort cloud? Fritz Zwicky and gravitational lensing? Positrons? MACHOs? Oh, come on... RAMBOs? Neutrinos? WIMPs? Axions? I had to do quite a lot of background research, which was actually fun, and rewind the audiobook more than once to go through some segments for a second or even a third time. Despite the fact that Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs is way ahead of me as far as my physics skills go, so I couldn't enjoy the book with ease, I don't think it was a waste of time. In one of the chapters, Lisa Randall likens dark matter to the Internet and its social networks:[M]ost of those who are communicating on social networks don't interact directly or even indirectly with each other. Participants tend to friend like-minded people, follow others with similar interests, and turn to news sources that represent their own particular world view. With such restricted interactions, the many people engaged online fragment into distinct non-interacting populations within which they rarely encounter an objectionable point of view. Even people's friends' friends don't generally confront the contradictory opinions of unaffiliated groups. So, most of the Internet's participants are oblivious to the existence of unfamiliar communities with different, incompatible ideas.This book has opened my eyes to many new things. High energy physics is still beyond my grasp, but Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs has lifted yet another veil. Lisa Randall continues: Dark matter just isn’t part of ordinary matter’s social network. It lives in an internet chat room that we do not yet know how to enter. It is in the same universe and even occupies the same regions of space as visible matter, but dark matter particles interact only imperceptibly with the ordinary matter that we know.To walk the Earth now, having read the book, will be a completely different experience. To know that billions of dark matter particles, transparent and shielded by their invisibility, pass through each of us every second... I find it beautiful. Like a brand new world: discovered but still unknown, uncharted."
295,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282565-audrey,2,"Overall, I liked this book. It was an interesting read, and it was refreshing to read a book about a new theory on the cutting edge of cosmology rather than yet another book explaining spacetime, gravitational lensing, and general relativity. While ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs"" definitely included some of this, it was really fascinating to also be privy to the other people, theories, and processes that led to the development of this seemingly far fetched idea.I had only two problems with this book, the first being the nonexistent editing (for more horrendous editing in a nonfiction book, see The Calculus Wars: Newton, Leibniz, and the Greatest Mathematical Clash of All Time, although that one is also a generally horrendous book). Maybe this is just me, and maybe the average science book reader doesn't even notice these things (aren't science people supposed to pay attention to details?) but OH MY GOD. The editing was horrible. Punctuation left out, typos, double commas, and even a few(!!) truncated sentences made it into the mix. Add to that some questionable sentence structure, and I was having a minor heart attack. I'll admit, maybe I overreact a little bit to bad editing. I've made a sport out of finding and pointing out typos and grammatical mistakes in the world around me. However, this was a little ridiculous. The fact that there were unfinished sentences threw me a major curve ball, and small typos of the likes of ""adn"" or ""whicch"" were annoying. My second problem with this book is more a personal preference thing. It was weird to me that in this 400-some odd page book which is supposedly about Lisa Randall's theory of a dark matter disk and its role in the extinction of the dinosaurs, she only started actually talking through her theory in the last twenty or thirty pages. While the background information making up the first 380 pages was useful and interesting, I personally was there because I wanted to hear about this theory of hers. She kept referring to her theory throughout the book as if we already knew all about it and she was just throwing it in for context or comparison. I would've liked a better balance of the setting up of the theory and the actual explanation and dissecting of the theory itself, though I realize why she did what she did and I could definitely understand a defense of this choice.This is definitely a good book. I envy Lisa Randall in that she is so talented and intelligent both as a physicist and a writer, and both of these talents shine through in this book to their fullest extent (unlike my writing talents in this review apparently). I'd recommend people to give this a read purely based on the intriguing and unique subject matter and the good science writing, but be forewarned that the horrible editing is distracting and it takes the entire book to get to the reason why you picked it up. "
296,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3025649-cristina,4,"Lisa Randall (professor of particle physics and cosmology at Harvard) provides a comprehensive examination of how the Earth interacts with its cosmic environment. The first ~80% of the book presents both theoretical and data-driven explorations how particle physics, geology, and cosmology all contribute to our understanding of the history of the universe. But, as evidenced in the title, this all sets the stage for Randall's own research in dark matter -- specifically its potential role in influencing long-range comet trajectories. A bit dense, but definitely still approachable thanks to Randall's light-hearted asides and palpable sense of awe and wonder."
297,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36078202-dale-lehman,3,"Based on the title, this should have been the sort of book I normally eat up. Science generally, and astronomy, cosmology, and physics in particular, are among my lifelong interests. Unfortunately, I found Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs rather slow and repetitive. I suspect a large part of the problem is that I already knew a great deal of the material being presented and was eager to get to the new stuff: the idea that dark matter comes in several varieties, and that some of the stuff, whatever it is, may reside in a ""dark disk"" inside of galaxies, which may in turn play a role in perturbing the orbits of objects in the Oort cloud and, periodically, result in impactors that cause mass extinctions on Earth.Randall starts with dark matter and cosmology, gradually zooms in on galaxies, solar systems, and the interaction between meteorites and Earth's biosphere. She then returns to the subject of dark matter in the third part of the book, detailing current research aimed at identifying and locating dark matter particles. Finally, she discusses her own research into the possibility of different varieties of dark matter and the possible existence of a ""dark disk"" inside the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. But the latter--which for me is the really interesting stuff--only occupies the last three chapters, and really only parts of those chapters. To be fair, there probably just isn't that much material available right now to make a whole book on that particular subject. Those three chapters are more than sufficient to cover the concepts. The rest of the book is prelude--likely necessary if you don't already understand the subjects involved, but not terribly interesting if you do.So I would say that this is probably a good book for people who want to explore a wide swath of interrelated science, but maybe not so much for those who, like me, already know it. It's not a bad book; it's just aimed at someone other than me."
298,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65672028-ryan-bayes,5,"This was an extremely fascinating book, but not for the reasons given in the title; and that is speaking as a particle physics with some latent obsession with palaeontology. The underlying thought in this book is that the most significant moments in the biological history of our planet is the direct result of cosmological events. However, the hypothesis that leads to this result is in fact more significant than the theme of the book. The structure of the dark matter that makes the interaction with the solar system possible requires a more complex picture than what I had appreciated; a picture that I think requires more research on my part and maybe more thought on how to test its hypotheses. An excellent book overall with an excellent story to tell. "
299,0062328514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"This is a weird book. Most of the book is not about dark matter or about dinosaurs, but is a long detour through physics and geology. Only the last part is about dark matter and how it periodically causes comets from the Oort-cloud to come in our direction. That part of the book was interesting. To connect the comet with the dinosaur the author took a long detour through physics and geology, but this feels contorted. The cosmology from the early part in combination with the last part on dark matter would have resulted in an interesting book in itself. Knowing that one of those periodical comets (possibly) killed (or was partly responsible for killing) the dinosaurs would have been a nice factoid for the introduction, but nothing more. Apparently the author (or the publisher) thought that a book on dark matter wouldn't sell, so it was turned into a book on dinosaurs. A bit like a schoolboy who had prepared for an essay on the elephant but in fact got the assignment to write about the ant, and hence started his essay:one day an ant walked up the trunk of an elephant - followed by a detailed description of what the ant saw in the elephant. Of course, any book can ultimately be about dinosaurs, so if this publishing trick catches on we might see titles like 'Gravity killed the dinosaurs' (the thing fell from the sky after all) or 'Dinosaurs founded New York' (by going extinct and causing mammals and then humans to thrive)."
