0,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,2,"I have become very interested in the faith/science debate, and over the last couple of years have read a fair number of books about it. This one felt a little like the atheist version of Collins's The Language of God. The title suggests that you're going to get a rant, but Stenger is no ignorant ranter. He comes across as a charming retired scientist who loves his grandchildren, reads widely, and is justifiably a little proud of his distinguished career in physics. He has written this book to convince you of something he thinks is no more than common sense: modern science has demonstrated that the story of the Jewish/Christian/Islamic God fails to hold water. Quite reasonably, he approaches the subject from the point of view of a scientist, and treats it as another scientific hypothesis. If God existed, what would we expect to find? If you've read things like The God Delusion or God is not Great, a fair part of the book will sound rather familiar. We learn for example that there is no good evidence for miracles or for many key stories in the Bible, that prayer has no effect when tested in controlled studies, and that atheists are no more immoral than Christians on obvious metrics of what constitutes morality. (Fun fact: 80% of the US prison population describe themselves as Christian, only 0.2% as atheist). In all these cases, Stenger says, what we see is exactly what we'd expect to see if there were in fact no God. Hence, there probably isn't one; but, as already noted, we've been here before.So I probably wouldn't have read the book, if it hadn't been for the intriguing foreword from the late Christopher Hitchens. Hitch says that, in his opinion, the only really serious argument for the existence of God is the claim of cosmological ""fine-tuning"": the fundamental constants of physics seem miraculously to be set to exactly the right values for life to be possible, suggesting that Someone was responsible for doing the tuning. He goes on to say that Stenger comprehensively refutes the argument. I have read rather a lot about the fine-tuning argument, for example in Martin Rees's 
Before the Beginning
 and Susskind's 
The Cosmic Landscape
, and was interested to learn more; I was expecting some version of the ""multiverse"", and wondered how he was going to make it so unusually convincing.Well: I must say that I was rather surprised. Stenger's line is that there is no fine-tuning, and hence no case to answer. He claims that a wide range of settings could have resulted in a universe where life was capable of arising. I am not technically qualified to refute his arguments, but I do note that they are completely at variance with those given by Susskind, who states categorically that the constants are extremely carefully tuned. It seems quite impossible that both Stenger and Susskind can simultaneously be right.As already mentioned, Hitchens, one of the leaders of the New Atheism movement, warmly recommends Stenger; if you look at the relevant section of The God Delusion, you will find Dawkins, another central figure, equally enthusiastically endorsing Susskind. Maybe I am being unkind, but an examination of the passages in question does leave me wondering just how much Dawkins and Hitchens actually know about cosmology. Hitchens, for example, refers to ""the universe exploding away from its Big Bang starting point"" (the Big Bang didn't start at any point), and a little later talks about ""red light"" when he evidently means red-shifted light. It seems fair to adapt Stenger's reasoning. If the New Atheist case against the fine-tuning argument were based on genuine scientific knowledge, we would expect a coherent line to be taken. In fact, we are getting at least two different and incompatible counter-arguments. One might thus feel justified in concluding that the New Atheist position here is not based on genuine scientific knowledge, but rather on uninformed prejudice.There are times when I feel extremely tired of the New Atheism, and nostalgically look back at the Old Atheism that preceded it. What a shame Bertrand Russell is no longer with us. He would only have needed a couple of trenchant sentences to put these people in their place."
1,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,3,"How You Get There Is What CountsI am in sympathy with Stenger’s project, the demonstration that the religious dogmatic idea of God is bad for human beings and other living things. But I can’t accept his logic which is tendentious and self-contradictory.Stenger recognises, quite correctly, that neither theism nor science has a universally accepted meaning. So he defines the former in terms of the religions of the Book: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The obvious difficulty then is that even this restriction doesn’t reduce the conceptual variability of the idea of God very much. So he reduces it further to what he believes are its essentials: a consciousness that is responsible for existence and that regularly if unexpectedly involves itself in the course of that which exists. Fair enough. He captures the bulk of religious adherents in this net, even if some of the most modern outliers escape.He’s got the same issue with science. There is no agreement about what constitutes scientific thinking, scientific method, or even a scientist. So Stenger defines science as the formulation and testing of conceptual, that is to say linguistic, models. Science, he believes, describes but does not interpret the world. While even his epigraph by the great Von Neumann contradicts this claim, it is possible to rationalise it by suggesting that what he intends to convey is that scientific models are always tentative. Unlike religious dogma, these models are debated, tested, and often discarded depending upon whether they work or not. A model works better than another if it effective in a wider range of practical or experimental circumstances. And therein, according to Stegner, lies the fundamental difference between science and religion. Nothing about science is fixed; not its principles, its methods, or its conclusions. Science learns through experience and adapts itself to the world as it is. Science is inherently relativistic. Religion, on the other hand, imposes an experience and filters the world through a mesh of complex doctrines. Science is empirical and experimental; religion is rationalistic and dogmatic. What could be simpler or more obvious? Science explores reality; religion gropes for the source of existence. The former works; the latter doesn’t. Epistemology and ontology are on the side of science.Stenger’s pragmatic criteria of ‘working,’ however, is itself problematic. Ultimately he means that which works is that which is beneficial to human life. What benefit does he have in mind? Longevity? Prosperity? Personal satisfaction? Surely he can’t mean horsepower, explosive yield, or giga-cycles per second. And if not, what are we to think when these bigger benefits are not correlated with one another? Nuclear physics works in correctly predicting the power contained in atomic structures. It fails in protecting us from radiation poisoning. The internet provides incredible knowledge and convenience. It also created Trump. Are these things working or not?Clearly any consensus about the meaning of ‘working’ is as temporary and variable as everything else about science. To claim otherwise would be dogmatic. This is an issue of politics not morality; or, rather, political morality. Even the rules of scientific argument are unclear. But rules there are. Science is rarely a violent activity, other than perhaps the occasional conference punch-up by rivals. Certainly no one has suggested warfare as a response to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, despite the intense emotions its can generate. Science is a kind of politics which in fact seeks to establish what ‘better’ means. When it stops doing this, it is termed Scientism and has effectively become a religion.And this it seems to me is the real distinction between science and religion - the nature of their politics. The politics of science is ‘open’ in the sense that disagreement is tolerated, sometimes grudgingly but always eventually. There are certainly scientific schools of thought, cliques, and movements which believe each other to be misguided, misinformed, or lacking intelligence. But they unavoidably remain together in the attempt to discover not only what works better but what working better means. There is perhaps no better example of this than in the debate about climate change, which is essentially about what is good not just for human beings but for the entire planet.Religion stops this search for the criterion of the good either by defining some abstract end point to human existence (the presence of God) or by prescribing some universal rules for behaviour (morals) which are hidden rationalisations for institutional self interest. Once established, these are then beyond debate. Consequently dogmatic religion is subject to heresy, schism, and alienation. The alternative to debate is often violence which is never good for human beings. More damaging, however, is the destruction of the kind of political community that constitutes science. This is a community that is in a sense pre-religious. That is, it doesn’t allow itself to become fixated on what anything means, especially God."
2,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44519745-fran-ois-b,1,"In one word: Weak.It's quite obvious that Stenger isn't an author per se, which I suppose could excuse his horrible prose. He doesn't have much of an excuse however for taking the time to write this book and yet not taking the time to honestly study at least the basics of classical theology as to familiarize himself enough with the subject matter to be able to avoid conjuring up an army of strawmen to defeat.I don't know why I put myself through this to be quite honest. I take the time to read the books that modern popular level atheism recommend but I should learn my lesson to at least stick to philosophers.Reading page after page of Stenger's attempt to apply scientific method to his impoverished and woefully inadequate understanding of what classical theism means when speaking of ""God"" left me cringing the entire time I wasted reading through this book. If I were an atheist, one with an accurate understanding of classical theism, I'd be embarrassed for the atheist community that this book had even been published, and even worse, had been given a good reception.Victor Stenger, as with all of his ilk, should stick with what he knows and avoid the temptation to stray into the unknown (to him) territories of theology and philosophy.To give an example of the evidence of Stenger's intellectual sloth; he quotes St.Thomas Aquinas at some point in the last quarter of the book and he does so in order to attempt to support one of his assertions and yet the entire book attests to the fact that he certainly hasn't taken any time to acquaint himself with Aquinas's work in terms of understanding what is meant by ""God"". Clearly he just picked up this Aquinas quote somewhere but never could I believe he ever actually read, much less studied, any of Aquinas's theology.I suppose this all does make some sense. He is, after all, a scientist who surely is fairly busy. Also he holds to atheism, albeit seemingly a shallow and critically unexamined kind, and as such I can understand his lack of interest in committing to taking the time needed to thoroughly examine his object of criticism. All this makes some sense. What doesn't make much or even any sense, is that despite his lack of honest interest in the subject matter, he will take the time to write 258 pages of drivel about a topic he is unwilling to study beforehand, not even study it as much as is needed to make sure he understands it accurately enough to avoid erecting endless strawmen.It was just more Dawkins really. The only difference is that Dawkins can write decent prose."
3,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,1,"If anything, the title is disingenuous.Stenger is not trying to disprove the concept of a supreme being - just the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. And he starts with the premise that we can use science to discern supernatural phenomena. But by definition wouldn't supernatural things not follow natural laws and so not be testable by the scientific method? He lays out 5 conditions to evaluate ""extraordinary"" (supernatural) claims. I'm not sure if he made these up or what. For someone so dedicated to science he gives no explanation of how he came up with those or where he got them. But, come to find out, what he wants to do is define God in a specific way, and disprove that God. ""The thesis of this book is that the supernatural hypothesis of God is testable, verifiable, and falsifiable by the established methods of science."" That's a damn bold claim, even if you are narrowing your definition. But as you read the beginning of the book, rather than disproving the existence of God, he is disproving the Judeo-Christian-Islamic model of God. He doesn't explicitly make that point. It seems like there's a difference between ""science has disproved a God that did something specific"" and ""science has disproved that God did that same something"". As an example, take evolution. I would say that science has disproved that God created humans as a distinct life form, and instead used evolution; Stenger uses this phrasing: certain discoveries ""falsify the hypothesis of a God who created humans as a distinct life form."" Is it semantics? Is he disproving something God did - or disproving the God that did it? Again, he's trying to disprove a specific type of God. Chapter 2 suggests that God isn't needed to explain our world. That's still a long way from the hypothesis he is attempting to disprove. Chapter 3: ESP does not exist, ergo God does not exist. Come on, Stenger; you are better than that. Oh, also, prayer and the existence of a soul has been disproven. While I'm tracking that there has been no science to support the idea that God answers prayers, I'm still a bit fuzzy on the scientific proof that there is no soul. I suspect so is Stenger. Chapter 4: If we can describe the origin of the universe with natural means, God does not exist.Chapter 5: Life and the universe does not require that a God existed to create it. Chapter 6 examines biblical veracity. First questioning prophecies, then questioning historical facts. I have the same issues with the former (which hurts evidence for an ""inerrant"" Word only, IMO) and will have look in more depth at the latter. Either way, this does not disprove anything, but does question what theists posit as ""proof"".Chapter 7 is a discussion of arguments for the existence of God based on morality.This is all just poking holes in the current arguments for the existence of God. Which is different from disproving it. So far, there's nothing new here. It's all been done before. In chapter 8, he finally attempts to do what he sets out to do - disprove God (though still not using science). He does this by bringing up the problem of evil and suffering. I'll admit this is one of the biggest concerns with the existence of a benevolent God. But of course, this is one of the shortest chapters in the book, and he doesn't address it very well. But it seems to be the best he's got.In chapter 9, he finally attempts to pull it all together. Using the arguments in previous chapters he tries to weave a cohesive argument against the hypothesis that God exists. Ultimately, he fails. This might be a great primer on the weaknesses of the arguments for a benevolent omnipotent personal God, but it falls way short of what it purports to be: a scientific treatise proving God does not exist.

I remember struggling with quite a bit of it, probably due to my lack of knowledge of physics.When I am suitably enthused, I will re-read, ie, 'listen' to this on audiobook.In the meantime, I am about to listen to Stenger's more recent audiobook: ""God and the Folly of Faith: The Incompatibility of Science and Religion"". I think I am a bit of a glutton for ""physics"" punishment!"

I believe that he convincingly disproves the existence of God. He writes clearly.

If you have already read a couple of books on atheism and science then you will probably find no arguments that you haven't already been exposed to. However, some of these arguments are presented so clumsily that I became skeptical of a conclusion that I already agreed with prior to reading the book. I can only recommend this book to people who have never read anything on the subject before. Reluctantly, at that."
7,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,4,"That's the first time that I read a book written by an atheist and it was really enjoyable, this book makes your mind wonder and think. I loved the chapter about the problem of evil and the qualities of God in which he discussed the contradictions of the qualities of omnipotence and benevolence attributed to God (at least the abrahamic one) with the existence of suffering and evil (espeacially the unnecessary one).I also liked the chapter about our place in the universe which adresses the question whether the universe is fine-tuned for the existence of humanity or not, Stenger answers the question with a big NO with great arguments.I still believe that the question of existence of God cannot and will never be answered neither bu religion nor by science, because they are still debating the question and don't seem to accept a final solution. But Stenger's work is a big step towards solving the God puzzle."
8,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1866292-g-branden,4,"Much better than I expected.I was prepared for a humanist rant. No doubt that's exactly how many people will receive this title--particularly those who don't bother to read it. (The same goes for this review, since the four stars are plainly visible above.)Rather than fulminating, retired physicist Stenger proposes to undertake a scientific exploration of the God concept, and consider the evidence for or against this proposition.George H. Smith, who wrote 
Atheism: The Case Against God
 decades ago, cautioned atheists against getting into existence arguments about God with believers before the essential question of defining one's terms was disposed of.So it is with this author. Stenger does not propose to refute all God concepts, past, present, and future. The God concept he challenges has specific attributes which distinguish it from other conceivable gods.But neither does he set himself too small a task. The God he undertakes to disprove is no less than the one most popularly believed in the Western tradition, that being the personal God who created the universe for the benefit of human beings, who controls all events, who knows your innermost thoughts, who does not hide his existence from those open to evidence, and who will intercede on your behalf, given sufficiently earnest prayer and satisfactory achievements in piety.It is this God, and not the gods of deists, animists, or Buddhists, that Stenger claims is subject to scientific scrutiny and found wanting.Stenger's central thesis is a simple one, and he identifies himself as holding a minority viewpoint even among scientists in frankly stating it: if God's influence can be discerned in the material world, be it through the fine-tuning of the cosmos to permit us, the creator's most beloved creation, to flourish, or through the alteration of physical events--such as the ravages of disease or natural disaster--then such interventions should be empirically measurable. After all, a God whose influence is indistinguishable from random chance is not one who intervenes in any meaningful sense. A devoutly Christian craps-shooter who meticulously measures every throw of his dice over thousands of throws and finds a Gaussian distribution in the sums of the tosses has not benefited from divine influence, no matter how earnest his prayers, because an atheist or worshiper of the wrong god will find the same result in his own craps games (assuming ""fair"" dice used by all involved, of course).Stenger's approach is academically scrupulous and heavy on citations. While small, unreproduced medical studies about the positive effects of intercessory prayers on patient outcomes make headlines in the English-speaking press, subsequent, larger-scale studies with more controls which show no such effect fail to make the news. Stenger brings both sorts to the reader's attention here.For me, the centerpiece of the book is a sequence of chapters aiming to disprove on physical grounds the miraculous creation of the universe. This material will no doubt be the most challenging to most readers, as despite the author's careful explanations for the lay reader, and complete avoidance of equations, it is still somewhat heavy going. For example, the discussion relies heavily upon the reader's grasp of the concept of entropy, which is something even many engineering students struggle with in their thermodynamics courses. Nevertheless, I myself have just enough background in physics to follow his argument, and it is a very neat one.I do think his explanation of ""why there is something rather than nothing"" was hasty. I would liked to have seen more depth. It seemed to boil down to a bare assertion that the amount of entropy in an empty system is necessarily zero, so the second law of thermodynamics necessitates the spontaneous creation of energy (perhaps as a single pair of virtual particles). Put another way (and if my lay understanding of these Big Concepts is accurate), a zero-energy universe is subject to a vacuum metastability event--see Wikipedia for fascinating reading. Of course that on its face violates energy conservation, a law which Stenger otherwise recognizes as sacrosanct, so I'm not seeing how he squares this circle.It is a nifty thought, but it sorely needs more development. As it stands, a believer can simply retort that one has ""merely"" identified the mechanism of miraculous creation. When the rest of Stenger's arguments are brought into play, I don't think this is the case, but the burden of parrying this thrust should fall upon the writer, not the reader.In any case, such a weakness is not fatal to Stenger's enterprise. Why? Because one has to, at all times, be wary of a bait-and-switch attempted by all too many believers. I've participated in many theist-vs.-atheist arguments in my life, and witnessed many more, and hardly a one has gone by without an extraction of an admission of the possibility, however remote, of some creator God, at which point the Bible-believing interlocutor races to force the substitution of *their* God, with Abraham, Noah's flood, the Exodus, the Ten Commandments, the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, salvation exclusive to those who exhort John 3:16, and so forth.In short, the contra argument ""if there is a possibility of any god existing, then my God must exist, and you'd do well to get right with Him right away"" is a colossal non-sequitur for what should be reasons obvious to anyone practiced in elementary reasoning in any other context.In fact, and in an admission I found very interesting, one of the species of gods that Stenger claims not to have refuted is the ""hidden"" God of some strains of evangelical Christianity. This is the God of John Calvin, who is omnipotent, who manipulates all sensory perceptions and instrument readings (if necessary) to eradicate evidence of his own presence, and refuses to reveal himself except to those who abandon evidence-based reasoning and are willing to proclaim themselves in his thrall as an act of blind faith. This God solves the problem of Evil by being not only indifferent to the fates of agnostics or liberal Christians, but by permitting disaster to befall even his own elect so as not to give away the game to those who will infer the existence of a God only from evidence.This God concept runs into major problems with the Cartesian theological argument, which holds that God is not a deceiver. Such a God would, you'd think, be a problem for writers like Karen Armstrong, who wants to rally all believers under one big ecumenical flag.Stenger offers no comfort for such efforts. As he points out, theologians have never reconciled the Problem of Evil with the traditional traits of a Supreme Being who loves humanity--omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence. That is, unless, one redefines one's notion of ""goodness"" to permit a literally cosmic campaign of deceit deliberately aimed at one's own supposedly favorite children.And, as Stenger argues in his final chapter (and consistently with Christopher Hitchens et al.), it is precisely this variety of fervent religious belief which leads people to break from the universal ethical principles that humans uphold when not excessively entangled with religion, and deliberately slaughter innocents in the belief that one is serving a higher power that perfectly conceals itself from all objective observation, and whose moral code works in mysterious ways.Stenger's project is bad news for those who follow in the footsteps of Stephen Jay Gould and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and proclaim that there need be no conflict between the domains of reflection and study considered by religion and those considered by science. Stenger contends that there is no phenomenon not ultimately subject to being reasoned about, though he admits that in many domains we lack both the tools to do so and a clear program for developing them. But to leave to religion only those areas science has not yet penetrated is cold comfort for many believers, and rightfully so. They do not want to see their God boxed into ever-smaller partitions as human knowledge grows without bound.While he does not consider the subject himself, I would regard the evolution of the relationship between science and religion, and the shift of confessional affiliations, over the past couple of generations, as indicative that his thesis has explanatory power. One doesn't need to be a physicist to learn a little bit about the vastness of the universe and the difficulty humans have in surviving beyond the confines of our planet. One doesn't need to be a statistician to understand that prayers to alleviate the sufferings of the innocent, or prevent the deaths of the undeserving, often go unanswered--but not so often that the effects of prayer can be distinguished from random chance. The concept of an all-powerful God who loves all of humanity is hard to square with even the most fleeting glimpse at the evidence. At the same time, our culture prides itself on its theistic and Christian heritage (despite the deliberate efforts of many of the founding fathers, who permitted no allusion to Christian doctrine in the Declaration of Independence nor even mention of God in the federal Constitution). It's easy to identify as a ""soft"" Christian, and almost as easy to identify as agnostic (""leave me alone, and I won't trouble you to examine your beliefs"").With soft infidelity growing in popularity, it is no surprise that growing minorities, particularly in America, find themselves having to choose between fire-breathing, Calvinistic evangelicalism and a rejection of religious belief altogether. At first glance it is an irony that one of the gods Stenger doesn't claim to be able to refute is the one believed in by the most obnoxious of Christians (and, not coincidentally, those most hostile to scientific teachings where these conflict with scripture or the policy objectives of their political allies).However, I think that further reflection reveals that this is not an irony, but rather a great opportunity. The Calvinistic evangelical tradition asks for blind faith in a large, complex tangle of propositions (usually including Biblical literalism, itself a pickle when one encounters mutually contradictory elements of scripture). This tradition bankrolls extreme politicians and supports the bombing of abortion clinics, preaches holy war against Muslims, and wants to enroll the apparatus of the government in inspecting your bed to ensure you're not engaging in forbidden forms of intercourse. (Or, in recent years, wants to prove that gay and lesbian pair-bonds are less stable than hetero ones by prohibiting such couples from explicitly and legally entering into those very forms of stable relationship.) Moreover, this tradition simultaneously claims that we are all miserable sinners, ghastly in our inadequacies, and that we can have perfect knowledge about anything, thanks to divine revelation.The alternative tradition--Stenger's tradition--asks that you have faith only in the human capacity to reason. Granted, it does ask that you credit this ability to some of your fellow human beings some of the time--we can't all be experts in everything. It acknowledges that we are fallible beings who may have to change our minds or expand our perspectives; it furthermore, in some of its more esoteric niches (ask me in comments), actually forecloses the possibility of knowledge to certain levels of detail. But it asks little else, and in return, it makes our current level of civilization possible.Stenger spends a book explaining why this choice isn't a false one; the God concept which permits us to grant pluralistic lip service to both traditions evaporates in the light of reason.In this book, Victor Stenger makes a strong case that cafeteria Christianity, and other modern religious traditions like it, are incompatible with careful reasoning based on our present level of knowledge about the universe. If you find the remaining alternatives--outright atheism; a God who is separate and apart from the universe, does nothing for humans, and does not respond to their prayers; or the vengeful, deceptive, hidden God of John Calvin--all distasteful, then the fact that you're faced with a difficult choice is yet further evidence that God is not inclined to give you a lifetime of easy decisions.And that may be because God simply doesn't exist."
9,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10380469-nour-sharif,2,"Ok, let me put this as simply as possible. I have been an Atheist for the last four years, ever since I was an adorable 14 year-old with long beautiful hair, and as I was reading this book, taking the Atheist stance - which is now second nature to me - I was not convinced by what he was saying. Seriously. Then how about a theist?The arguments were very brief, not elaborated, not justified and not even given enough examples. Most of the examples are even a mention of someone else's book or essay, or even sometimes his books and essays (the author's) without quotes or elaboration of the person's idea. Just a quick mention. To tell you the truth, the book felt like a miniature advertisement electronic board. I can sometimes move from Atheist stance, to theist stance (since I was one myself and since I have a big fat skeptical brain in that cute skull of mine and because I suspect I have multiple characters disorder), and I could tell sufficiently that it was not a book that could convince a theist. It was too brief, and his very frequent mention of the two words ""In short"" three times every single page while not even providing a long argument in the first place made me want to bitch slap his old face. The arguments were good, and I could see a handful (NOT MORE) of new ideas that I have not heard of before. These could come in handy on the long term, maybe if as an Atheist I want to debate someone, and that means I have to find ways of elaborating his ideas. But on the short term, the book seemed like a poor job of organizing jumbled ideas that we see everyday on social networks and blogs and even ideas mentioned in other Atheist books. Let me put the last idea simply. Imagine the book was a text book and it was taught, just as it is in a university course, and then a test about the book was given to students. They have a few days to prepare and study the book. I can tell you, if the book was presented as a science course, no one will pass. The book was very poorly written and poorly elaborated, and poorly justified that a person who doesn't a prior knowledge of things of this kind will have a very very hard job understanding the book due to the lack of explanations. And I want to bitch slap his old face another time because of the amount of times he said ""in short, our universe would look exactly the same if our universe did not have a creator"". Seriously. It is like he made up for the lack of explanation and elaboration and the poorly presented arguments by saying this sentence at the end of every  SUB CHAPTER  . "

The author, unlike most authors who expect readers to have some knowledge of the subject they’re writing about before picking up their books, Stenger doesn’t make this assumption or mistake thus making the book an easy, uncomplicated and non-threatening read.The following quotes were impressive.With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion.""—Steven WeinbergStill, any God model remains a human invention, formulated in terms of human qualities that we can comprehend, such as love and goodness. Indeed, the gods of ancient mythology—including the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God-are clearly models contrived by humans in terms people could understand. What is amazing is that in this sophisticated modern age so many still cling to primitive archaic images from the childhood of humanity.Stenger also proves how statements in the Bible were taken from other sources like The Doctrine of the Mean13, written about 500BCE, Isocrates (c.375 SCE), The Hindu Mahabharata, written around 150 BCE, Taoism. Taote Ching 49, Buddhism Dhammapada 223, Hinduism, Ramayana, and Yuddha Kandall 115 just to name a few sources. This can serve to prove that the Bible is made up of many books.Stinger was also able to prove how many things stated in the Bible never happened: Isaish 17:1, Jeremiah 49:33, Zechariah 10:11 and Ezekiel 29, 30.If you only read a handful of non-fiction books a year let God: The Failed Hypothesis be one of those non-fiction books you read in 2012.

12,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919652-jed,4,"The debate would appear to be settled. There is no God. Now, perhaps we can all get on with the business of building as just a society we can in a world with immeasurable natural beauty without looking for fear or inspiration from a non-existent deity.Stenger calls on a huge volume of sources to make his case. He tries very hard to find something, anything in the Universe that would require the supernatural to describe. He finds nothing. No serious study has ever been able to find anything. At some point, rational creatures must conclude that God, like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, is a human invention.According to the National (US) Bureau of Prisons, 80% of inmates are Christian while .2% are atheist. Born again Christians are more likely than the general population to divorce. Prayer has never been shown to produce a positive effect. Ergo, you can't even really claim that religion makes us live better."
13,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This book is an excellent addition to the literature by the ""New Atheists"". Stenger is a physicist, and he brings a lot of credibility to his arguments. Rather than simply summarizing the debate as stated by others, Stenger brings some new ideas and developments to the debate. The anthropic principle states that the fundamental physical parameters that govern the laws of physics seem to be fine-tuned, to be ""just right"" for the development of life. Previous authors have stated that if the parameters had been just a little bit different, then life would not be sustainable anywhere in the universe. Some authors have claimed that this is an argument in favor of a creator, who deliberately chose these particular values of the physical parameters in order for life to exist.The anthropic principle has long bothered me, because the argument has been echoed by many people in this debate. However, Victor Stenger has looked into this principle in more detail. He showed that most of the fundamental parameters are dependent on one another--only four of the parameters are truly independent. He relates the results of his own calculations, where he allowed the parameters to change, but required the dependent parameters to change together. He found that even when changed over orders of magnitude, the structure of the universe still would have allowed for stars to live long enough to generate heavier elements, and thus be favorable to the development of life.In addition, Stenger describes how the creation of matter ""from nothing"" does not contradict the laws of physics. The rest mass of the universe, when concentrated at a single point, has a certain positive energy (E=mc2) that could be exactly balanced by its negative gravitational energy. Moreover, the generation of this mass does not require a ""causation""--many examples from quantum mechanics show how random events on the quantum scale are probabilistic, and do not require an outside ""cause"". Also, Stenger argues that the so-called ""big bang"" need not have been the beginning of the universe. There is no observational evidence that the big bang that occurred 13.7 billion years ago must have been the first and only big bang.Stenger makes it clear that his arguments disprove only the existence of a Judeo-Christian-Islamic God, with theistic or deistic attributes. Stenger reiterates that his arguments do not necessarily disprove the existence of a god with other attributes. (But he does make such an argument in his later book, Quantum Gods: Creation, Chaos, and the Search for Cosmic Consciousness.)"

God: The Failed Hypothesis
. Considering the religious and political views of the state in which I reside, that is a bold move. A significant portion of the population might well consider the placement of Stenger's book as flaunting the devil's work.[return][return]At the same time, the placement of the book is reflective of some of the buzz the so-called ""new atheism"" has been generating due to the popularity of Sam Harris' Letter to a Christian Nation and Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion. Among the issues they raise is why religion is exempt from the same scrutiny applied to other areas of life and society. Although Stenger does not go as far as Harris or Dawkins in condemning religion itself, he takes the ultimate analytical step in the process. He subjects the question of the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God (and, hence, the very foundation of those religions) to the scrutiny the scientific method would apply to any other hypothesis.[return][return]Stenger is fully aware of and does not hesitate to refer to the cries theists raise to this approach. Specifically, they claim that matters of faith, belief and miracles are not amenable to logic or the scientific method because they are outside science itself. Balderdash, says Stenger. You don't need to apply science to beliefs or faith itself. Instead, it can be applied to the factual foundations of the assertion that God exists.[return][return]Balance of review at http://prairieprogressive.com/?p=976"
15,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/937966-mark,4,"Dr. Stenger does an excellent job of pointing out that propositions such as “God exists” can actually be studied rationally, and answered intelligibly. With such questions as “Does God exist?” typically come problems concerning wishful thinking, false causes and dilemmas, question-begging and the like. Dr. Stenger points out an obvious but often forgotten fact: all of our scientific knowledge is based not on deductive logic but on inductive logic; that is to say that the concept of truth that we all tend to abide by is defined by probability rather than certainty.Given this premise, Dr. Stenger can and does conclude that the existence of God is more improbably than not. This book is able to circumvent typical problems inherent in many discussions concerning the existence of God because it clarifies the definition of “God” that most Judeo-Christian religions (including Islam) desire: an omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent creator. Given such a definition, logical contradiction ensues. It goes further however.Dr. Stenger does not rely upon logical contradiction alone, but points out two things: that no where in the universe is the scientific data that points to there being a creator, and the universe can be explained without having to allude to the existence of a creator at all. The book points out that this point is different than the typical proposition by many: that because God is unknowable by science, his existence cannot be explained by science (and the added proposition), and must be explained elsewhere (spirituality etc…).At times the book can be a little “preachy”, mostly towards the end, but generally speaking, it adheres to its original argument: that given how science works, science can be used to generate truth with regard to the existence of God."
16,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1504787-aaron,5,"The best of the ""neo-atheist"" books, in my opinion. Basically the book attacks the notion that science and religion are ""non-overlapping magisteria"" to quote Steven Jay Gould. He points out that Judeo-Christian religions make claims that are scientifically testable, such as that prayer has an influence on the world. Stenger isn't overzealous: he understands that he is merely showing that there is an utter lack of evidence for the ""Personal God"" of the western tradition that interferes with humans in our day-to-day lives. He isn't providing evidence against an abstract, hands-off God of some sort. So the subtitle should more accurately be: ""How Science Shows That The Personal Judeo-Christian God Does Not Exist."""
17,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"In many ways the best of the ""atheistic"" books recently published""The thesis of this book is that the supernatural hypothesis of God is testable, verifiable, and falsifiable by the established methods of science."" --from page 29""...I will...argue that...science has advanced sufficiently to be able to make a definitive statement on the existence or nonexistence of a God having the attributes that are traditionally associated with the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God."" --from page 11These statements are a great leap forward from the fairly recent belief (I'm thinking of the late, great Stephen Jay Gould, for example) that we ought to render unto science things belonging to science and unto religion things belonging to religion. But what Professor Stenger is saying is that we can look at religion in a scientific sense and decide which aspects of it are true and which are false. In particular Stenger looks at the God of Abraham and fulfills the promise of the subtitle: ""How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist."" Note that it is only the personal God of the three Middle Eastern religions that he specifically lays to rest. The Ineffable God of the Vedas is presumably still standing, as are many other gods who are not defined as personal and possessing the three O's: omnibenevolence, omnipotence, and omniscience. An interesting book including arguments against the existence of some other gods is The Impossibility of God (2003) by Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier (cited by Stenger; see my review at Amazon).Stenger's is a step-by-step consideration of the arguments and the ""evidence"" for God's existence, followed by a demonstration that the arguments are faulty and/or the evidence is lacking. For example, he shows how the evil in the world is inconsistent with a God possessing the three O's; he shows how all the endless stories of miracles and such are easily explained by means not requiring an intervening deity; he (as many others have) demolishes the argument from design; he shows how morality has nothing to do with God or religion, that it is something humans naturally have, and that in fact, followers of especially Islam and Christianity, are less moral by most standards than are unbelievers.The God of the Old Testament is exposed as ruthless and evil; Stenger even refers to the so-called ""hidden"" God (that is, hidden from nonbelievers) of evangelical Christians as a ""hideous God."" His point is that by staying hidden from nonbelievers this God (cf. the God of John Calvin) effectively makes certain that most people will spend an eternity in hell, people such as ""Mahatma Gandhi...along with the six million Jews killed by Hitler and billions of others who died without accepting Jesus."" It is interesting that Stenger allows that such a god could exist, but ""I personally want nothing to do with him."" (pp. 239-240)As significant and important as showing that God is a hypothesis that has failed is, I think some other aspects of this fascinating book are what make it such an important read. I learned that a good answer to the eternal question (and one of my favorites) ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" can be answered by ""nothing is unstable"" (Frank Wilczek) or, to put it another way, it is impossible for there to be nothing but nothing. (pp. 132-133)I also discovered that the universe did not necessarily begin with the Big Bang, that events do not necessarily have causes, and that ""even if the universe does not have a mathematically infinite number of events in the past, it still need not have a beginning."" Additionally (quoting philosopher Keith Parsons), ""To say the universe is infinitely old is to say that it had no beginning--not a beginning that was infinitely long ago."" Here Stenger makes a nice distinction between the infinite of mathematics and the infinite of physics. He writes, ""Physics is counting. In physics, time is simply the count of ticks on a clock. You can count backward as well as forward. Counting forward you can get a very big but never mathematically infinite positive number and time 'never ends.' Counting backward you can get a very big but never mathematically infinite negative number and time 'never begins.'"" (pp. 123-125) The salient point, as Georg Cantor made clear, is that infinity is a mathematical concept and not a number. These points are brought to refute the claim that the universe must have had a beginning and therefore a creator God.Stenger even brings entropy into the picture as an argument against the universe being created. He notes ""If the universe were created, then it should have possessed some degree of order at the creation...."" But according to Big Bang theory the initial state of the universe after the Planck time was one of high entropy or ""total chaos."" He then calls in ""the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy or disorder of a closed system must remain constant or increase with time."" So far it sounds like this is good argument (as it previously might have been) for God the Creator to have injected order into the cosmos since we clearly have order today. But then Stenger shows that because the universe is expanding, the order we see here on earth and elsewhere doesn't violate the second law because ""maximum entropy...increases faster than the actual total entropy...."" (pp. 117-119)I have read and reviewed in recent months The God Delusion (2006) by Richard Dawkins; Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006) by Daniel C. Dennett; and The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason (2004, 2005) by Sam Harris. While all three are excellent books and sorely needed in this time of attempted evangelical takeover of our culture and government, none of them is as closely and convincingly argued as is this book. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
18,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,2,"This book started off fairly interesting. It disputes the common notion that science and religion inhabit separate spheres, since science is the realm of the natural and religion the realm of the supernatural. Science answers how, and religion answers who and why. Science is about mechanisms and religion is about morality.He makes an interesting point about this: if religion were strictly about the supernatural, then it is of no interest to science, but insofar as it purports to have effects in nature, that very much is the realm of science. Any claims about the supernatural influence in the natural world is testable and subject to hypothesis and measurement. Whether a god exists is not all that relevant if it has no impact whatsoever in our daily lives. Being a particle physicist, he gives an analogy of quarks. We can't see quarks. They may not exist, but that's not all that relevant because the effects of quarks are measurable. Quarks, as a model, help us make predictions in the world. If it stops being useful for that, then the model is no longer valid. The same can be said for God. If the model provides measurable effects in the world, and those measurements help us make predictions, then God is valid as a model, irrespective of His existence. Testing the validity of this model is a perfectly valid area of scientific research.He then proceeds to look into the areas that have researched the God hypothesis, and all of them have concluded that there is no god, as defined by the mainstream religions (it's impossible to disprove any possible god, as the definitions of it are endless). Thus follows a shit load of science. I always find it funny when atheists do this. As if the problem is simply a lack of understanding about science. Don't they get that religion's way of gaining knowledge comes from revelation, not research? But what else can they do? The reason for not believing in a god is because the evidence doesn't support it. If they want to demonstrate this, they need to explain the science. It just seems futile.As the book went on, I just kept feeling bored. It's not that he makes terrible arguments. They're decent, just not particularly insightful or new. I didn't find them all that persuasive, and I'm someone who is already persuaded. I can't imagine many religious believers persuaded by this book. I'm sure some would, but even they would probably be better off with some other atheist books.By the end, it just started feeling ranty. He seemed to stop trying to make a solid case, and just wanted to complain about religion."
19,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4446326-daniel,4,"Ya' know, I'm starting to think maybe this whole God thing isn't all true.Well, I've always felt that way with almost 100% confidence, but after reading God: The Failed Hypothesis, I am truly sure that this can be proven. This book is extremely comprehensive. As far as I know, it covers every single argument for the existence of God, and completely demolishes all of them. Not only this, but as the title suggests, it actually proves that god does not, and (perhaps more importantly) cannot exist. Now, I will admit, as I read I did feel that some of the arguments reached their conclusions a bit presumptuously, but rest assured that any gap in logic or potential rebuttal is more than covered in later chapters. I cannot possibly imagine anyone reading this book and still believing, but I know they somehow will. As often happens with science books of this type, some of the chapters in the middle get a bit jargon heavy and tough to follow. Chapter 4, entitled ""Cosmic Evidence"" was really dense for someone with as basic an understanding of cosmology and particle physics as mine, but the general ideas carried well. This was, however, the only chapter in the book where I felt this way; everything else was very interesting. That being said, a lot of this book is pretty clinical and cold. Stenger is there to address his topic, and he doesn't mess around. However, it does warm up, get more comfortable as the discussion progresses, building to an absolutely beautiful concluding chapter. It gave me one of those science-is-so-awesome smiles to which I am so prone. You absolutely need to read this book, whoever you are. "
20,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/523305-prooost-davis,5,"My view for a long time now is that, in our modern world with so much updated information, the fact that so many people believe that a single book thousands of years old is the Word of God is simply astonishing. No less surprising to me is the amount of time and effort by intelligent people to try to fit the ""God of the gaps"" into ever smaller gaps. And the knots that people have tied in logic for thousands of years in an attempt to explain the ""problem of evil"" strikes me as the ultimate in self-delusion.Scientific organizations often distance themselves from arguments over God, mostly to avoid fuss, I think, but physicist Victor J. Stenger has waded into the fray many times, claiming that science can say something about the existence of God, and that, if God exists, there should be measurable evidence for it. Religions do make claims about the world, and these extraordinary claims deserve extraordinary evidence, which we don't find.The book takes on Intelligent Design; the idea of the soul as something that survives the death of the body; the idea that the universe needed a creator; the idea that the universe must have been fine-tuned to make way for life; the divine origins of religious experience; and whether religion is the font of morality.Stenger defines his terms and his God precisely. He is dealing with the theistic God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, a God who is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-loving, and who interacts in human events.That books like this should need to exist in the 21st Century is another thing that baffles me, but I fear we need more of them."
21,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112-scott-lerch,3,"For the most part this book was very objective and clear. It lacked the arrogance of a Richard Dawkins book which I think only helps Stenger's case. However, I feel this book would be lost anyone who isn't already a scientist because the book is more a bulleted list of theories he says disproves God existence due to lack of evidence otherwise, only referring to other works on physics, cosmology, and evolution. It would take a dedicated layperson to research his hundreds of annotations.With that said I think he makes and decent case that the universe shows a clear lack of evidence for God for someone who already understands the basics of the sciences discussed. I thought his strongest arguments related to cosmology and the big bang but will definitely require more research before it fully convinces all scientists. He also did a good job pointing out the logical fallacies related to believing in God and the many contradictions and just plain scientifically inaccurate statements within holy texts such as the Bible. Overall this was a good book on the subject but by no means comprehensive or conclusive, but Stenger makes the point that science has stayed on the sidelines of religious debate for too long and that it's time for science to jump in and show the public what its got to say on the subject of God."
22,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769655-mike,2,"Ok....imagine a universe without god. Now picture this one. But I repeat myself. Paraphrasing very loosely, that's the thesis here. I read this book from the library, thereby depriving myself of the loveliest part, which is a beautifullly haunting photo of the earth from space. The book is OK. Turns out that I value reading good writing more than I would have guessed, as I give this book two stars more for its pedestrian writing style than for its content. It has all the charm of a sink. This dude is a particle physicist, and he's at his best, naturally, when discussing physics. I love reading works for physics written for dummies like me. They provide me with a vocabulary and with a nano-second's worth of delusion that, hey, I GET this. Then after the nano-second elapses, I realize, ummm, yes, I can start talking about quarks and Planck time and whatever else but I have no earthly idea what these things are. Oh Newton, why couldn't you have the final say? Anyway...this book, like the other new atheist books I've read, is best when it discusses science, not religion. Naturally. Sorry for the typos. "

If you want to believe in god, you just counter every argument with: ""Yeah, but god can do whatever he wants."" Or ""Science schmience."" However, if you're at all skeptical of this whole god thing, it kind of spells out how ludicrous the notion is that there is a kindly human-shaped creator to this massive universe, who stuck us on a tiny speck on the edge, who we expect to remember we even exist so we can pray to him regarding the outcome of the football game. If I can break down the argument of the author, who presents it much more scientifically, it's this: get real people, at least the Eastern Bunny brings candy."

However, a good chunk of the book is esoteric if you don't have a firm background in math or physics which is why I docked it one star."

Stenger searches for evidence of a higher power in his new bestseller. Is it time to issue a theological Amber Alert? by Vince Darcangelo For more than four decades physicist Victor J. Stenger has explored that which is undetectable by the human eye. Prior to retiring in 2000, he was a leading researcher in the area of particle physics, a branch of science that studies the elementary constituents of matter and radiation and the interactions between them. As a scientist, Stenger has researched miniscule subatomic particles, but as an author and philosopher he's been searching for something very, very big—the existence of God. Now serving as an adjunct professor of philosophy at CU, and professor emeritus of physics and astronomy at the University of Hawaii, Stenger has authored seven books, the most recent of which, God: The Failed Hypothesis—How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist, is currently a New York Times bestseller. As a theistic roll call, God: The Failed Hypothesis is the philosophical equivalent of Ben Stein's famous ""Bueller? Bueller?"" query with the Big Guy marked as absent. Stenger discusses the scientific evidence and dissects traditional and nontraditional arguments in favor of the existence of God, including the theory du jour, Intelligent Design, and concludes, ""Earth and life look just as they can be expected to look if there is no designer God."" It's the type of book that could be a real buzz kill if you let it, but in the hands of Stenger, a scientific textbook transforms into an existentialist treatise on how to live in a godless world. ""When I recognized that I was not being controlled by supernatural forces but am on my own, I found that fact immensely relieving,"" he says. On Saturday, March 17, at 2 p.m., Stenger will read from and discuss God: The Failed Hypothesis at Borders (1750 29th St., Boulder, 720-565-8266), the first in a summer-long series of speaking engagements that will take the author/scientist throughout America and into Ontario, Canada, and Dublin, Ireland. Stenger recently hooked up with the Boulder Weekly—a newspaper that scientific research has determined does exist—to discuss the absence of God and why Stenger identifies himself as a humanist rather than an atheist. Vince Darcangelo: God: The Failed Hypothesis has become a New York Times bestseller. What do you think has drawn people to this book? Victor J. Stenger: It happened to appear just when there was a surge of interest in criticisms of religion, occurring no doubt as a reaction to the excesses of the religious right and their corrosive influence on the Bush administration. Endorsements by best-selling authors Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, among others, helped enormously. VD: God: The Failed Hypothesis seems to be a progression of your earlier work, including the book, Has Science Found God? How did you come to this line of research? Where do you see yourself heading next? VJS: I have always been interested in seeking answers to the most fundamental questions. My research career, before retirement in 2000, spanned the great developments in elementary particle physics that started when I was a graduate student in the early 1960s. I was a participant in a number of discoveries that lead to the highly successful current standard models of particle physics and cosmology. In the 1980s I began to see how science was being misused to make outlandish claims in religion and what was once called New Age spirituality. I started to speak out critically about those claims. One of my books, The Unconscious Quantum (1995), refuted the assertion that quantum mechanics supports the existence of psychic phenomena such as ESP. As mentioned above, I now see the same thing happening in theology, so my next work is tentatively titled The Godless Quantum. VD: In writing and researching this book, you focus on what you refer to as the ""uppercase"" God, ""not all gods."" So, for those who haven't yet read the book, and may make assumptions based on the title, when you refer to God as a failed hypothesis, are you saying definitively that no god exists or that God as He is understood does not exist? If the latter is the case, do you leave open the possibility that some god or gods could exist? VJS: Yes. I basically rule out the God worshipped by most Jews, Christians and Muslims, along with the creator god of any culture—including the Enlightenment deist god of people like Thomas Jefferson. The only gods remaining are those who care not a whit about humanity and have nothing to do with us or hate us so deeply that they are the cause of human suffering. But, thankfully, we have no reason to believe in these gods any more than we have to believe in Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. VD: You contend in the preface that God ""should be detectable by scientific means simply by virtue of the fact that He is supposed to play such a central role in the operation of the universe and the lives of humans."" In essence, God is in the details—or should be, at least. A common argument for the existence of God, however, is the ""God of the gaps"" theory, as you say, which goes that since science can't explain everything, God must exist in those unexplained areas. How do you dispel the ""God of the gaps"" argument? VJS: The God of the gaps argument usually is applied to some existing gap in scientific knowledge. As long as science can give a plausible explanation for filling that gap, even if it can't yet verify that explanation, then the argument that God is needed to fill the gap fails. Only after you show that no plausible natural explanation is possible can you bring in supernatural explanations. It can happen. I give the hypothetical example where well-conducted experiments in intercessory prayer show that Catholic prayers heal the sick while no other prayers work. I can conceive of no way that could be explained naturally. Indeed, well-conducted experiments have been done and show pretty conclusively that a God does not exist who answers prayer in any significant way. VD: What is your perspective of the theism vs. science debate? How about that of your colleagues? VJS: Dawkins, Harris and I are among a growing minority of scientists who think it is time to take a harder line against superstitious thinking. Most of our colleagues, the majority of whom are atheists, seem to think that they need to pander to religious moderates in order to maintain their support in issues such as creationism vs. evolution and financial support for science. We see a more important debate than creation vs. evolution, namely reason vs. superstition. We look at the disastrous effects of the faith-based, rather than evidence-based, policy making of the Bush administration as ample reason to question all religious thinking, not just the most extreme fundamentalism. VD: Are science and theism incompatible? VJS: I think so, although I do respect the attempts of some theologians to try to come up with a rational basis for beliefs that are compatible with science. The problem they have is that science views humanity as an accident of evolution while most religions place humanity on a step just below God, saints and angels. Most theistic evolutionists still think God stepped in along the way to guarantee that humans evolved, so whether they like it or not they are still in bed with the intelligent design creationists. VD: Are science and theism necessarily at odds as the progress of scientific knowledge has often come at the expense of religious belief? And is this why the battle between science and religion is so contentious right now? VJS: History demonstrates this. Practically every fundamental scientific discovery has called into question traditional religious teachings. The war runs hot and cold. Today it is hot. It will cool as America follows Europe and becomes more secular. The signs are already there, with young people becoming increasingly non-religious. We are about where Europe was 30 years ago. VD: You refer to Intelligent Design as ""stealth creationism."" What is your take on Intelligent Design? Do you see ID as a passing incarnation of the argument from design or a more grounded design theory that has some staying power? VJS: I think ID is now dead, in that name anyway. Rest assured creationism will re-appear under some other pseudoscientific designation that attempts to hide its religious motivation. VD: You address many of the negative aspects of theism, such as its exploitation for power by the ruling class and the numerous wars that have been waged in the name of God, as well as the terrorism we see today. You even state that, ""Many people are good. But they are not good because of religion. They are good despite religion."" Regardless of the truth or falsity of this statement, do you fear that delving into this sort of commentary potentially exposes a bias in your research? VJS: Well, it's an empirical fact, not a bias. If the facts were otherwise, I would say so. VD: What sort of backlash, either scientific or popular, do you anticipate from this book? Have you received any at this point? VJS: Of course I expect letters and e-mails from wackos. I have only had a couple so far. I ignore them. I expect serious challenges to my reasoning by theists, and that is fine. I expect criticisms from scientists and other academics who disagree with my position about religion and science. These are often closet believers. What I hate are the reviews where someone says, ""I have not read this book, but it is wrong because..."" VD: I am an atheist, albeit a reluctant one. In my experience, most atheists are reluctant because they want there to be a higher meaning and an afterlife. What do you make of the human longing for spirituality? What advice do you have for those on the skeptical side of the fence who would prefer if the scientific evidence did prove or at least support possibility of the existence of God? VJS: I can give you a hard-nosed, New Jersey answer and simply say, that's the way it is. Deal with it! But I have a much more positive outlook, which is based on the philosophy of humanism. In fact, I prefer to call myself a humanist rather than an atheist. Humanism is as ancient as any religion and is, from what I know of history, the true source of much what religion has claimed as its own. Take the Golden Rule. Christian preachers will tell you it came from Jesus, but they must know that is not true. Even Jesus did not claim that, if you read the Gospel of Matthew. It was part of human thinking long before Jesus. In fact, there isn't a single original moral teaching in the New Testament. My favorite piece of art is La Pieta by Michelangelo in St. Peter's basilica in Rome. Most people would see this as a religious work, but I see it as intensely human. I am inspired that a member of my own species could take a chunk of marble and carve out of it something so beautiful and so touching. Such magnificent talent gives me hope for the human race. Somehow that talent is diminished by attributing it to some external, supernatural power. When I recognized that I was not being controlled by supernatural forces but am on my own, I found that fact immensely relieving. We are free. There are no gods or ghosts. As an atheist T-shirt says, ""Relax. There is no Hell."" VD: There is a certain comfort in theism, in particular concerning the afterlife. I imagine most people long for an afterlife because they don't want their own consciousness to cease at death. Likewise, most people don't want to think of their dead loved ones as simply decomposing in a burial plot. What is the value of disproving the existence of God and removing these comforts? VJS: What possible benefit can come from living a delusion? Why not just drug yourself into oblivion? I would think that it is better to come to grips with the facts of life and adjust to them. All our thoughts, memories and emotions are carried in our brains. Within minutes after we die and the brain is deprived of oxygen, they are lost forever. That is an almost incontrovertible fact. All we can do is live the best life we can while we have it, and move off the planet so our children and grandchildren can have room to live their lives. VD: In your own way, you necessarily delve into existentialist philosophy in the final chapter, ""Living in the Godless Universe."" Are there any voices from this realm that you feel really resonate today, especially if working under the premise of there being no God? VJS: Carl Sagan and Richard Dawkins have written eloquently from that point of view. But another I can mention is John Shelby Spong, the retired former Episcopal bishop. Unlike Sagan, Dawkins and me, Spong still believes there is some higher power out there. However, he rejects most traditional Christian thinking as delusional, showing better than most atheists why this is so. But I disagree with him about the need for a higher power and do not see anything so special about a Jewish carpenter from Nazareth who damns everyone to eternal fire who does not grovel before him. VD: Has scientific advancement played a role in the prominence of monotheism over polytheism? VJS: Not in any way that I can see. All conceptions of gods are based on human experience. Once we worshiped the sun, moon and animals. Then God was modeled after kings, obviously to justify their power over everyone else. Religion has always been the means by which those in power justify staying in power. We had the divine right of kings, now obsolete with the God-king sure to follow. I was recently in India. There the vast majority live in poverty and squalor. They don't revolt because their religion tells them it is their fate, their dharma. What a terrible thing is religion! VD: In the chapter on ""Cosmic Evidence,"" you discuss the concept of time and the notion that the universe ""need not have a beginning."" There seems to be a logical human conception that everything must have a beginning. In laymen's terms, how could the universe not have a beginning? VJS: Let's first look at whether time can have an end. Time is the count of ticks on a clock. We count forward, tick after tick, event after event, and though the number can be very big it is never infinite. It never comes to an end. Now count backward. Tick precedes tick, event precedes event. That count also never terminates. We never reach a beginning. VD: In the same chapter you argue that an empty universe is less likely, and one that would be more in need of supernatural intervention, than a full one. Could you briefly explain what this means and its consequences?VJS: This is discussed in The Cosmological Cosmos, and I mean to write more about it. Basically, most physical systems that are highly symmetric are unstable. They tend to undergo phase transitions to less symmetric states. Liquid water is more symmetric than an ice crystal and water will change to ice in the absence of any heat. Heat, or energy, is needed to reverse the process. The most symmetric thing you can think of is the void, where you have removed all the matter. So it is also the most unstable. Something is more natural than nothing."

In reading through the various reviews of this book, which has a near-4 rating, it's incredibly funny and predictable how the fundies and other bible thumpers try to attack Stenger -- who allegedly not only doesn't use science in this book, but apparently doesn't even know it; I assume all of the fundies making this criticism have their freaking PhDs themselves in scientific fields since they obviously are claiming authority on what is and isn't science??? Anyway, these people nit pick and target a few select lines or assertions of his to ""prove"" that Stenger did not ""disprove"" god. So predictable. I just read one who was sarcastically (presumably) making fun of his interpretation of Stenger asserting that anything that can be described or generally proven though ""natural,"" scientifically accepted methods means such things aren't God's doing. This critic is making fun of that. Holy crap, what an idiot! Um, yeah, that's basically the massively accepted and assumed consensus on the part of nearly all scientists, as well as freethinkers, rationalists, and plenty of other people. That pretty much nails it on the head. If science can explain natural causes, etc, for a whole variety of things, events, etc, then YES, you don't bring god into it! It's been proven to be non-supernatural. Duh! Fundies excel at nit picking non-fundie philosophers, other religionists (particularly other theists), scientists, and other people of differing persuasion, yet once you start pointing out the thousands of discrepancies, inconsistencies, inaccuracies (god showed Moses the part of Cannan known as ""Dan"" before he died, the irony being, there was NO place named ""Dan"" at the time; how do you know which of the two creation stories to believe in Genesis?; the crucifixion is described in all four gospels, yet while each described a sign above Jesus's head on the cross, they are ALL different from each other, so again, how do you pick out which one to believe?,; Moses, the author of the Torah/first five books of the OT, describes in detail his own death and burial in Deuteronomy, which I guess made him a zombie, and SO many damn more falsehoods and bullshit that countless books many hundreds of pages in length have been authored by Christians, atheists and others, pointing out just a number of them, because to get them all, it would surely exceed 1,000 pages), conflicting information, outright falsehoods (Nazareth evidently did not exist during this alleged census -- which also is verifiably historically wrong: there was none then, and not for about another decade -- and would not exist for several hundred more years, so obviously Joseph did not come from there.), and totally stupid ""evidence"" or ""logic"" (Example, with two problems -- Jesus's genealogy. The Jewish Messiah was supposed to have descended from King David's lineage. So two gospel authors felt it important to include Jesus's genealogy to ""prove"" he descended from David, thus helping to confirm his legitimacy. However, one just goes back some 14 generations to David while the other exceeds 30 and more generations, and to top it off, virtually none of the names of Jesus's ancestors leading to David match! Maybe one name. That's it. So, which one's right? How do you know which to believe? Or are neither of them right? This spurious discrepancy immediately calls into question the credibility of both authors and both gospels. But I said there are two problems. The beauty of the second problem is that it's so much more relevant that it pretty much wipes out any issues with or complaints about the previous problem I just described. The Messiah had to be of the line of David, and if Jesus was the Messiah, he would then have to have descended from the line of David. Well, throughout their history up to and beyond this time in Jewish culture, a person's line and genealogy was defined SOLEY through their fathers! Indeed, these two gospel genealogies refer, as is seen regularly throughout the bible, to a person as ""son of 'X',"" etc. And I hope you're seeing the irony now, and thus the outright bullshit? Joseph, an apparent true descendant of David, was NOT the biological father of Jesus!!! He literally passed no genes or DNA on to Jesus. Meaning that Jesus was absolutely NOT from the line of David, meaning he could not have been the Messiah at all! Freaking beautiful. And yet you'll never hear that mentioned in church, will you?), etc.Look, not everyone will agree with the thesis of this book or Stenger, his points, examples, etc, and I get that. No book is universally loved and respected. And while I agree that a couple of the chapters are certainly weaker than others, which is virtually inevitable in a book such as this, and while Stenger doesn't resort to a Ph.D.-level volume on the subject, I tend to think he does a basically decent job of what he sets out to do, and at a very reader-friendly level, which some can't seem to accomplish. And while I've obviously read better, conversely I've read much, much worse, so I thus think that Stenger did a fairly good job at a complex and incredibly comprehensive subject (books 10 times this length could have been written about this, and you still wouldn't touch on everything), and while Stenger could have chosen to better address a few issues or perhaps have touched on some that are left out of this volume, on the whole, it's not a bad place to start for those who want to see how god stacks up against science. Oh, and I read one or two criticisms that focused on Stenger apparently addressing only the christian god. Well, I'm pretty sure that most points made in this and similar books could and do apply to ALL theistic gods, if not ALL alleged supernatural entities as a whole. The fact that Stenger refers to the christian god should not be held against him, because he is writing from the perspective of one raised and educated in, and almost certainly lives in the primary biggest and best known christian country, one in which you're exposed almost exclusively to the christian god and one in which right wing evangelicals have been working for decades to creative an evangelical theocracy here, and in which they've nearly succeeded and probably will. Thus destroying the country in the process. Finally, I'm very willing to bet the people criticizing this author for focusing on the christian god, apparently to the exclusion of Allah or Yahweh, are believers of and followers of these other religions, or even other ones, and I'd be shocked if these people actually think Stenger should be additionally addressing these other gods, as they share equal importance to the christian god. In fact, I'd be willing to bet a whole lot on that. So, hypocrites, don't be so damn stupid! If you can't fight the facts, shut up. And ultimately, please know that if science doesn't have the answer for everything (and it doesn't - yet), that doesn't freaking automatically mean the answer must obviously be supernatural, and moreso, must also be the christian god! There's no logic to that at all! Even if the supernatural were given partial credence, what gives you or anyone the right to insist it be the damn christian god (yours) instead of Buddha, Allah, Thor, Zeus, or any of the thousands of other gods that have and do swirl around this planet? Geez, try to use your brains for once and stop being a sheeple! What makes you so sure that you are right, in your christian god, while Muslims, who are equally as fervent and devout -- if not moreso -- and equally convinced of their heaven and hell, are obviously wrong, or ditto for Jews, Hindus, and so on? Even IF there were supernatural explanations for anything, why in the world does it have to be your own instead of someone else's? Think about that, why don't you. In the meantime, recommended book.

34,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,2,"How do we reconcile our existence with God's creation?This book appears to capitalize on the much publicized controversy regarding the teaching of Biblical evolution, referred to as intelligent design, as a biology subject. In the federal trial of Tammy Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District during the fall of 2005, Professor Behe of Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a leading proponent of intelligent design gave significant muscle to the argument of fundamentalist Christians that creationism has scientific backing. His argument rested solely on the fact that certain biological systems are too complex to have evolved through natural selection, hence they are created by an ""Intelligent Being."" Television and the media gave significant publicity to this trial which generated enormous public interest. This book makes references to Professor Behe, and attempts to relate God (the author refers to as Judeo- Christian-Islamic God) with laws of physics. The author is a physicist, and I was hoping to read a physical and philosophical discussion about space, time, and matter (or energy) from which life evolved, and invoke God's existence (or His non-existence) through His design of physical laws: These laws hold the ultimate truth. If physical laws are fully set to govern the universe; how would God give himself the option to intervene? The mystery perhaps lies in the physical laws themselves. In quantum reality, matter has wave-particle duality, hence physical existence at subatomic level becomes less-certain, and in fact certainty can be predicted only with a probability (in less certain terms.) Then how do we reconcile the classical reality we observe and experience with quantum reality? This is the area that needs most attention if anyone is addressing a serious physical and philosophical question such as, if God is real? This thought has crossed the mind of mankind ever since man set foot on this planet, but the author conducts his analysis in a ""careless"" manner. He asks himself several key questions, one of them is with respect to the origin of the universe. The author suggests that no known laws of physics are violated during the beginning, therefore it is not God created. The author has discussed the big bang purely from a classical standpoint without giving quantum physical treatment. It is widely believed that there are billions of parallel universes, also known multiverse. Our universe is just one island in Infinite Ocean, with billions of tiny islands, each of which could have there own laws of physics, more than three spatial dimensions, made of antimatter, different kind of forces, and different fundamental particles. Each of these universes is completely isolated by special theory of relativity. On the lesser side of science, the author widely uses the term ""Judeo-Christian-Islamic God"" to refer to God, but doesn't explain how Christian God is the same as Islamic God. Is the author trying to be politically correct to increase marketability of his book or he doesn't understand the difference. The God of New Testament deeply believes in peace, forgiveness, harmony, coexistence and acceptance. This is quite contrasting to a ""holy book"" which preaches jihad, holy war, fatwa, death for apostasy, and intolerance to infidels which are based on revenge, retaliation, and tit-for-tat concepts. Author Moorthy Muthuswamy observes that about 65% of Koran and 75% prophet Muhammad's biography (Sira) call for violent conquest of infidels; one can see where the global Islamic terrorism is coming from. At the end of each argument (many of these are not very convincing), the author concludes that ""God doesn't exist."" I did not itemize how many times I read that phrase in this book. In a scientific assessment, God is regarded as an entity, a creating potential, and the all pervading Supreme Consciousness. Albert Einstein, the greatest physicist of all time frequently referred to God in his discussions, but he did not imply any particular faith. Einstein saw beauty in God's design of spacetime, matter - energy relationship, spacetime - matter relationship, the symmetry in physical laws, mathematical elegance in the physical descriptions and cosmic wonders. One has to accept that religions are man-made and laws of physics are God-created. As long as this simple fact is not recognized, man will continue to fall into the pit he himself dugout. "
35,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988085-marije,3,"Useful collection of empirical evidence, a little short on words and subtletyBraintrainingStenger has a great talent: he is able to translate complicated science into enjoyable reading material.He mentions somewhere that everyone with an undergraduate understanding of physics (or math?) should be able to understand him. Unfortunately, my education in the exact sciences halted after high school. There are three chapters in this book that are particularly concerned with this part of science.Chapter 3, Searching for a World beyond Matter, was enlightening and offered some interesting studies, for example on the efficacy of prayer and the nature of near-death-experiences. Chapter 4, Cosmic Evidence, taught me some useful things about enthropy and order, and assured me that, statistically, the fact that there is something instead of nothing is not miraculous:In the nonboundary scenario for the natural origin of the universe I mentioned earlier, the probability for there being something rather than nothing actually can be calculated; it is over 60 percent.p. 133 I will have to trust Stenger on this. He might be right and he certainly is convincing in his other arguments, but the fact remains that I have no way to check this for myself.This goes even more for chapter 5, The Uncongenial Universe. I get the main point (the universe and laws of physics are not made for us, human beings; the fact that other life forms are possible but rare or non-existent is no proof that a God created the universe just for us), but the science goes right over my head.The good newsHowever, there is still plenty to like and understand about this book, even if you are a simple humanities graduate.Stenger's reasoning about God and religion is not new and not the most profound I've read so far. What makes this book valuable is the amount of empirical evidence he has collected. Many arguments about these issues seem to be stuck in theory; logic and philosophy might have many sensible things to say about it, but empirical facts can come in very handy to simplify the argument and speed things along.Stenger's style is also great to illustrate the beauty of science and the universe, I found myself physically nodding while reading pages 254-258.The bad newsMy main critique on this book is that it tries to put so many subjects in there that none of them get the attention they deserve. It is more a starting point for further reading than a complete and thoughful reflection on religion and God.A more general annoyance is that all these books that are refuting God seem about the same god. A god, accidentily, most liberal and science-minded people don't believe in anyway. Is it because that God a the mostl clearly defined one? Or the easiest to disprove? In any case, it would be interesting to read more about the other gods; the abstract ones, the ones equated with energy or love (to his credit, Stenger pays some attention to the use of energy and quantum mechanics in modern spirituality).Moreover, when Stenger leaves the field of facts to say something about religion, he seems to lack the subtlety and accuracy he portrays when discussing models and photons. I feel like he does not really understand the depth and variety that religion is. His tone of voice will definitely scare away some people, as will the recommendations of Dawkins and Harris. Not neccesarily a bad thing, since those people will find a way to refute his evidence anyway, but maybe something to bear in mind.Lastly, and a little surprisingly, I thought he was a little too compliant on the subject of 'Hypothetical Observations That Would Have Favored the God Hypothesis'. Even if we had a record of an earthquake in Judea at the time of the supposed crucifiction (one of his examples), does he really think that would be a score for the God hypothesis, as proof of the bodily resurrection of Christ? Other, more logical and less supernatural explanations of such an event are available. "

The rational prospect of life after death is close to nil. But, at least, science can assure us that the many who happened to choose the wrong God will not be tortured through all eternity - that those millions who lived and died before the jealous God was invented will rest in peace. As an atheist T-shirt says, ""Smile. There is no hell.""[...]I do not deny that religion has inspired great art and music, which does much to enrich our lives. I personally have spent many happy hours viewing religious art in the great museums of the world and listening to sacred music in concert halls and recordings. [...] Many religious stories appeal to us as poetry and plays do. They are parables speaking to the human condition. Their value has nothing to do with the supernatural or whether they are true.

It offers a short, but compelling set of arguments that set out to do two things. First, to state emphatically that science can (and should) be tested against religion or the supernatural whenever such things make empirical claims. Second, to show how science does not support the Judeo-Christian-Islamic (JCI) God. There is room left for the possibility of a creator of some kind that set things into motion (although it hasn't then interfered with anything else so there might as well not be any god), but such a god would not be the personalized busy-body that is the Abrahamic God. Victor Stenger points out that if the JCI God exists, then there should be evidence of him everywhere because he's supposed to be in everything, and even postulates various forms of evidence that would prove the existence of a god... but none of those bits of evidence have ever been found. ""But God is supposed to be everywhere, including inside every box. So when we search for God inside a single box, no matter how small, we should either find him, thus confirming his existence, or not find him, thus refuting his existence"" (Stenger 27). He also notes ""that the main purpose of scientific models is to describe rather than explain. That is, they are deemed successful when they agree with all observations, especially those that would have falsified the model had those observations turned out otherwise"" (Stenger 13). A few of the later chapters of the book were harder to follow due to technical details and mentioned of some works I hadn't read, but overall the book was a concise and intelligible presentation of the scientific arguments against God.

(Quoted in the book.)My own philosophical or religious beliefs are not relevant to this objective review. If you need to know what my religious affiliations are to determine the relevance of this review, then this book is probably not for you. I will only go so far as to admit that I don't consider myself an atheist. But I am both cynical and skeptical of any group or individual who claims to have 'found it,' as it were.Victor Stenger starts the book slowly, and the first two chapters are laced with complex (to me) academically scientific groundwork that can be off-putting. Once he establishes his credentials, (which are impeccable) and the motives for writing the book, he proceeds to lay out a very cogent and well organized critique of the foundations of religious belief. He lumps the Judeo, Chrisian, and Muslim religions into one general thematic belief system, which, right there, is intriguing because these three religions are set at odds against one another to a large degree.Mr. Stenger provides extensive and detailed references for his conclusions, all conveniently placed at the back of each Chapter. Clearly, this is a man who is well-informed and whose opinion is based on exhaustive research.It's a quick and easy read, with modest amounts of humor sprinkled throughout, and I would recommend it for those who seriously wonder how much truth and fiction there is in our general understanding of religious myths and legends. It's a great book for atheists, scientists, humanists and anyone who's just generally sick of running out of logical and reasonable responses to religious zealots, creationists, evangelists and morons in general. Not that religious people are necessarily morons, but rather that morons do tend to gravitate towards nonspecific religious fervor.I enjoyed the book very much."
39,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9797353-bilal-quadri,5,"This book excellently illustrates with logic and science that although the existence of every imaginable god cannot be scientifically disproven, the existence of a god with certain qualities can. Under the heading ""Gods who disagree with the data"", physicist Victor Stenger shows that science can disprove the existence of ""1. a God who is responsible for the complex structure of the world"", 2. ""a god who has given humans immortal souls"", 3. ""A god whose interactions with humans, including miraculous interventions, have been reported in scriptures"" 4. ""a god who miraculously and supernaturally created the universe"", 5. ""a god who fine-tuned the laws and constants of physics for life, in particular human life"", 6. ""a god who communicates directly with humans by means of revelation,"" 7. ""a god who is the source of morality and human values"", and 8. an omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent god. Stenger goes on to point out to those who accuse science of intentionally ignoring the ""supernatural"" that if scientific observations confirmed even one model of god, scientists would be EXCITED to delve into such a new field. And for those that say science cannot comment on god, he points out that if science ever did find evidence for god, the religious population would immediately use this science to justify their beliefs. For example, if prayer was found to work in the numerous studies which have compared the effectiveness of prayer on health, then this would instantly be brought up. But empirical data from several, valid experiments have shown that prayer has NO effect. The universe looks just as it would be expected to in the absence of god. Why is there ""something"" rather than ""nothing""? ""Because something is more stable than nothing"""

The truth hurts, don't it?I've always consdered myself an antheist, but this book made me a radical one. The physics was rogh going for this liberal-arts major, but the message is clear: The whole concept of the Judeo-Christian-Islamist God is utterly contrary to reason and an effront to nature and science. Stenger also takes on all psychic phenomenon and prophecy as utterly lacking in empirical evidence.He also decimates the ""eyewitness"" accounts of such things as the Resurrection and Exodus. There is no historical record of any Biblical happenings, let alone its supposed miracles. Christ's teachings are unmasked as simple rehashings of those of the Jewish prophets.The origins of the universe are explained as simple natural phenomena that needed no ""Creator"" to kick-start them. Evolution and chaos rule, folks--get over it!I've actually had people ask me,""If you don't believe in God, what is the purpose of your life?"" thsi infuriated me--and now I have an arsenal with which to argue. Stenger can barely contain his contempt for and rage against such thinking, which left me feeling exonerated. My favorite fun fact is that 60% of US prisoners (including hundreds on death row) self-identify as Christian. Oh, and the one about how cardiac patients who were prayed over actually had more reversals and complications. I loved the books concluding chapters about how easy it is to live in a Godless universe and create one's own moral code. Why is this just so damn HARD for people to accept? "
41,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4792664-jason,3,"Most of the new atheist books I have read have been very poor. This book is a notable exception to that trend. I agree with the approach taken by the author on the question of the existence of God, although I have come to a different conclusion on the matter. Two reasons it only got 3 stars instead of 5. The first one was the continual altering of counter arguments. Many times instead of dealing directly with the thesitic arguments, he alters them to make them easy targets. What made it worse was that it was totally unnecessary. He presents good arguments for the atheist position that stand on their own. There was no need to employ cheap strawman arguments. That cost the book one star. The second star deducted was for the last chapter in the book. Up to that point the the author makes a very good and dispassionate case for Athesim. The trivial rantings about all the evils of religion and it being responsible for all the world's problems was notably absent. This really set the book apart from polemic works of others like Dawkins and Hitchens. Unfortunately, in the last chapter Victor decides to go down that road. It was a very bad ending to what was up to that point an excellent work. Overall, I would say that this is the best book I have read advocating the atheist position. People should read it."
42,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4488858-marcel,3,"This books seems rather conflicted as to what its target audience is.While the writing style is very clear and ""readable"" enough to keep you reading as long as you're the slightest bit interested in the topic, especially the physics topics require a lot of previous knowledge and feel more like a check list with brief explanations than an actual explanation for the layman.I've followed the atheist discussion on youtube rather closely, and while the intellectual level there fluctuates greatly, most of the items on the god checklist in this book i had already discussed and researched.Therefore this book only offered me new insights in the more scientifically complicated fields and those i had to research on the internet to get the basic grasp of.This book also gets a BIG SMILEY STICKER for not being a sarcastic demonization of everything religious. Not that i personally dont love Dawkins snarky evil attacks, but they will hardly convince anyone of anything. From all the books of the ""New Atheist"" movement i know, this might be the only one even remotely able to convince (or at least cast doubt in) believers."
43,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5612611-jien,5,"I love this book. It is well written, clear, and very scientific. After reading a great deal about this subject, I can really see that though this is written for a layperson, it also requires a well-educated person to really grasp many of the specific details. Stenger refreshingly does not spend enormous amounts of time explaining every aspect of his subject. He explains enough for a smart reader to get it, and then moves on. It was nice to read a book that actually required my brain to be an active participant in developing my understandings of the subjects. (Even the science books I read seem to be watered down with explanations as they are meant for a broader audience, I like the ""some knowledge required"" aspect of this.) It was also interesting to realize that if I had read this only five years ago, I would have missed many important facts for the sole reason that I hadn't educated myself enough to know about the things that he was referring to throughout these pages.The conciseness of this book is really great, he covers nearly every argument for the existence of god and cleanly refutes them in short sections."
44,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Muddled and disappointing. Stenger's premise is that all mainstream religions—and particularly the Abrahamic ones, which he calls ``the great monotheisms''—make loads of testable predictions about the real world and that Gould's NOMA is a crock of shit, and that's obviously true; his follow-through, however, isn't what it should be.Though most of his actual arguments are correct—it would be sad if they weren't, given how trivially easy the question of religion is—they're often delivered in an unstructured way, or assume the reader is more familiar with specific controversies (usually ones which were discussed at length in talk.origins, the community which has produced some of the more well-known figures in online atheism) than is probably warranted, and the whole thing feels aimless and rushed. He picks up steam near the end, but it's too little, too late.Even the chapter on fine-tuning, which is supposed to be Stenger's strongest suit, isn't very good. I'm told he's written some book-length treatments of the same; I expect those will be better."
45,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56217834-savanah-gray,4,"I actually listened to this book on audible while I was moving. At first I was pretty sure that the arguments were tried and true tropes of the non-scientist, humanist, atheists. But by chapter three this is no longer true. While the book travels down many lanes that are well-traveled by atheists, it also does something that humanists haven't managed to do. It takes religious groups up on their offer and treats the religious arguments ""as science."" Of course, when true believers or creationists say ""teach the controversy"" or ""equal time"" they don't actually mean it. They know that if they held their beliefs to the scientific method, they would fail. Miserably. So Stenger politely agrees to engage with the smoke and mirrors games of the faithful. Removing this debate from the realm of humanist morality is often advised against by atheists. But Stenger manages to do this without wallowing in the muddy traps usually set by believers. He does it well. If you feel overwhelmed with the same information cycle recycled just move forward to chapter three. It's a good read!"
46,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185251-sabio,3,"Stenger argues against Theistic gods. His arguments are very old to me but arelargely sound and well written (albeit dry). This is a good read for those unfamiliar with the standard logical arguments. But beware, believers may contend they believe for logical reasons, but they deceive themselves -- most people believe for very simple emotional reasons. Because of this, logical argument is often wasted.The theist god is easy to argue against. A mystical and inspiring yet non-intervening deity/spirit is much harder to argue against. Indeed, they can't be tested. Make sure when arguing about gods, you first set down clearly what sort of god/spirit is being debated.But remember, people will always create intervening deities, it is in their nature. Here, believers wold say ""God wrote himself into our hearts."" I would contend that NATURE via spandrels wrote much in our minds/hearts."

It strikes me that this would be more useful as a reference than as something that's going to shape your ""belief""** that god is man made. The arguments here are logical and scientific in approach, which is to say, accurate, if boring.Most of this was ground I've already covered in various reading and whatnot, but I was struck by his pointing out that if God designed our universe, he did pretty poor job of it. We have our nice blue planet with temperate temperatures, water, trees, etc. but everything else is just frozen rock. He notes that just two out of every billion photons that our sun gives off come our way. Who would purposefully design something like that? Hint: nobody. ** Note, that of course, this isn't a belief at all. Just as you don't need to believe that 2+2=4, you don't need to ""believe"" that god is not real."

Stenger offers the reader a journey into the strict impossibility of an omnipotent god or gods.The book details a majority of its arguments using philosophy, and then applying the basic scientific method to those ideas. As well as this, physics are used to explain away the possibility of something or someone watching us, every second, every day, for all time.Those of the layman persuasion may find some of Stenger's arguments hard to follow, especially on physics, but they are encouraged to read through the examples given at least philosophically to make their own judgment.Highly recommended for technical and philosophical scholars, atheist/creationist debators, and those interested in technical physics in regards to theology."
49,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198371-jason,5,"This book is absolutely phenomenal. The only way to walk away from reading this book and still believe in deities and other supernatural creatures, is to simply refuse to acknowledge facts and reality. Victor thoroughly dismantles any foundation of theism or deism from an examination of theist/deist claims using the scientific method. He even briefly covers some philosophical and ontological arguments for god and soundly shows how feeble and toothless they are. In fact, that brief section is enough to bury theism/deism, but Victor delivers the death blow to these outdated beliefs with the entirety of his book, destroying any argument for creationism/intelligent design, the kalam argument and many others. This is a MUST READ for anyone with questions about their faith/religion, fence-sitters, or already liberated atheists/agnostics."

And elegant, in that Dr. Stengel goes beyond the traditional scientific dogma that holds we cannot say for sure that god does not exist because it cannot be proven she does not exist. Instead he shows that the god hypothesis is not scientifically valid or even interesting, for it is not falsifiable...i.e. there is no conceivable condition or observation that would negate the hypothesis (that she does exist), q.v. Karl Popper. The author poses a series of criteria or tests which, if met, would support the hypothesis; but of course all fail. It's refreshing to witness many scientists, logicians and philosophers pile on the band wagon of reason and common sense to hasten the demise or at least the salience of that age old bugaboo religion.

And, to those that say that science cannot prove the that God exists or not, this book proves that science, indeed, can and does prove that God does not exist.

""God: The Failed Hypothesis"" offers nothing substantive that the other atheistic books out there don't provide. Stenger is a physicist, and as such, this book will give you a bit more physics than the others, but where this one fell drastically short was the presentation and style. Victor Stenger may well be a fine scientist, but his writing is that of a high school text book; accessible, but humorless and dreadfully boring. The actual content of the book is sound, his arguments and analysis are valid and in accordance with all the available scientific knowledge and data, but good luck getting through this one."

It is very difficult if not impossible to prove a negative.What Stenger does is take various aspects of the above god and show how current scientific thinking makes it highly improbable that such a god actually exists. The writing is clear and forceful, with arguments that are hard to resist. Taken together with ""Letter to a Christian Nation"", Hitchens ""God is not great"", and some of Richard Dawkins writings, I think a reasonable open-minded person would at the very least come to the conclusion that the god as presented in the Bible is full of human failings, contradictions, and pure nonsense.After all, if all things are possible for God, why doesn't He heal amputees?"

However, I found many of his arguments compelling and scientifically sound. While gods can't be disproved, his arguments against the possibility of gods are scientifically sound and compelling.

Stenger contends that science _can_ investigate the supernatural, for if the supernatural can affect physical phenomena, then those phenomena can be studied by science.

76,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10595374-jacob,4,"Stenger addresses god from a scientific, particularly physics standpoint. He looks at the pro god arguments that deal with physics and then shows how there is no evidence for god, tries to look at what evidence for god would look like and shows how it isn't necessary to make an appeal to the supernatural in order to explain the universe.

It is well-stated with a more matter-of-fact tone than his New Atheism peers, which at least partly explains why Stenger is less notorious. Recommended for serial complainers about Dawkins et al being too strident or overstated."

79,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74203269-karthik-s,3,"Some of the arguments in this book are pretty interesting and is great to know about, but majority of the content is just something most people would know if you have a basic understanding of science. Half of it is interesting while the other half is just plain boring. I would still recommend people to read this book as it opens you to a new way of thinking and you'd learn something new."
80,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41486145-james,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It did not read quite like the other popular New Atheist books. This one was less about rhetoric and philosophical disagreements and more about what the hard data say about the probability of certain gods (or particular godly attributes) existing. Stenger very rarely deviates from this course, which makes the book a very linear and smooth read.In some of his later books, Stenger seemed to have trouble explaining concepts in such a way as to give laymen an intuitive understanding of what he was talking about (e.g., some of the physics concepts in ‘God and the Atom’). In this book he had no such trouble, and I felt he managed to explain everything in very simple and digestible terms. Not a lot of the subject matter was particularly complex anyway, but what was complex was well explained.The biggest strength of the book, though, was that Stenger clearly defined the kinds of god concepts he was refuting, and consistently noted the kinds of gods that particular scientific findings (or non-findings) did NOT refute. For example, he notes that the idea of the Enlightenment “Deist’s God” is not refuted by the data, nor is a less-than-benevolent Judeo-Christian-Islamic God who has chosen to hide himself completely. However, Stenger makes a solid case that we can conclude that many commonly believed-in god-beliefs are false, beyond a reasonable doubt. For example, the lack of any evidence for the efficacy of prayer is sufficient evidence that a god who answers prayers does not exist; the absence of any archaeological evidence of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt casts overwhelming doubt on the veracity of the Old Testament (and hence, the god it promotes); the success of models that hold that the universe began from absolute chaos (and now contains only pockets of order) casts considerable doubt on the existence of a god who created the universe from a divine plan; and so on.Not only does the book make solid cases, it utilises arguments from many different areas and references many different thoughts and theories. Stenger went over the implications of evolutionary theory, as well as findings in physics and chemistry. Then Stenger notes many of the failed prophecies of the Old Testament, as well as some prophecies that were posited AFTER the events they purported to predict, and the lack of archaeological and historical evidence for many religious claims (e.g., the lack of references to the massive earthquake that supposedly occurred as Jesus died on the Cross). He even gives mention to a relatively little-known and controversial theory that casts doubt on the historicity of Jesus even as a mere mortal in history (i.e., Jesus mythicism). His awareness of that theory even as far back as 2007 was indicative of some serious study, irrespective of the truth of that theory.It should be noted that while the tone and language are slightly dry throughout the book, I found it refreshingly simple to read. Most scientists and academics use a very rigid prose (I don't mean error-prone or awkward, just dry), but the focus of this book was the communication of the concepts, and sometimes elegance needs to take a back seat. Ensured communication and solid prose are not mutually exclusive, but it is a tight-rope that need not be walked for a book of this type. It does its job with a relentless bombardment of facts and good argumentation. I doubt many people pick up books of this sort for the beauty of the language within them.Positives aside, there was quite a severe little blemish towards the end of the book though, when Stenger started to delve into a political tangent wherein he slandered the late Justice Antonin Scalia. While Stenger’s criticisms of Scalia’s beliefs about the divine ordainment of governments were not unreasonable, many of his criticisms of Scalia were devoid of evidence and dripping with ignorance regarding his judicial philosophy (i.e., textualism and originalism). Stenger ended up advocating for a form of judicial activism, whereby a Justice should follow his conscience, as opposed to the letter of the law. This, of course, is a problem for the separation of powers, as it allows judges to override the legislature. So saying that Scalia would have voted against abolition because the Constitution does not forbid slavery or that he would have voted against women’s suffrage if he’d had the chance are just cheap pot-shots, dripping with ignorance about a Judge’s role.While that was very poor of Stenger, it was fortunately just a brief tangent that did not harm his central thesis, so I felt it should not affect the overall rating. Ultimately, this is a very interesting and well argued book, and makes a more tentative case than many of the other conspicuously atheistic books of its time. In focusing on evidence that we “should see” for particular gods, Stenger reminds us that absence of evidence CAN be evidence of absence (contrary to the complaints of theists). He does not step beyond what the evidence permits, and makes a rigorous case in support of the contention that the most common god concepts in today’s society are not supported by the evidence we have. We can be very certain that those gods (e.g., one who answers prayers or created the universe with an orderly plan) do not exist.I'd have given the book 4.75/5, but since fractions aren't available, 5/5 it is!"

82,1591024811,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1041468-jerry-smith,4,Stenger subjects God in particular and gods in general to scientific standards. Will probably not change anyone from their positions but at least he takes a different tack and avoids the sneering and patronizing tone adopted by Dawkins.
