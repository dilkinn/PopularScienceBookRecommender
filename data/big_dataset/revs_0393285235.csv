0,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"I really can't imagine how any one could recommend this book. There was not one topic in this book where I had not read about elsewhere. An author should always add something new to the topic if they are going to write a book on a topic. Especially, if the topic is as interesting as 'now'. The author knows infinitely more physics than I'll ever know, but he doesn't show it anywhere in this book. I would bet there wasn't a single matter of fact within his book on physics which I had not read elsewhere.Also, when he strayed from his expertise he really ends up talking about things he barely understands. He doesn't know philosophy but tries to weave it into the story. (Hegel says in his introduction to the ""Phenomenology' that 'any shoe salesman thinks they know philosophy', of course, that could also include writers of book reviews or physicist who write books with nothing new. Speaking of Hegel, how can someone be talking about the philosophy of 'now' and not give Hegel's definition as the ""indeterminate immediate'?). Einstein's block universe takes time out of the universe, Henri Bergson doesn't like simultaneity. Bergson has a point. Einstein would even claim that his 'original sin' was tying a physical clock to the speed of light. For a wonderful book, but, regretfully, philosophical, see the audible book of ""The Physicist and the Philosopher: Einstein, Bergson, and the Debate That Changed Our Understanding of Time"" by Canales. I only mention this, because the author never mentions Bergson in his book, and I can't imagine anyone writing a philosophical physics type book on 'now' not mentioning Bergson.He did another thing that always irritates me. He quoted from many philosophers such as Kant, and it was clear he had not read the author's book that he was mentioning, ""Critique of Pure Reason"" (or at least not had read him in recent years). I like Kant. I've read him recently. There just seemed to be a shallowness with the author when he brought philosophy into the story.The author doesn't like 'physicalism'. He'll capitalize it to make it a religion. He'll say atheist that believe in Physicalism have made it a a religion. It just seemed like a comic book straw man characterization he was developing. He brings up Hume (probably my favorite philosopher). Hume knows that we never see the cause just the effect. Hume is probably best characterized as a materialist instead of a physicalist but there are similarities, but Hume knows that, for example, the gravity that holds a vase on the table is never seen. Hume would say that the gravity is not real, but we conjecture it. The author never got beyond the surface when he talked about complex philosophical problems that are mentioned in this book such as cause and effect, free will, the soul, determinism and the flow of time itself. The author brought up Karl Popper and his falsification criterion. For one thing, when one does that they should always add the words 'in principle' after the word 'falsification'. Another thing, science has multiple values for a reason, because there are always ad hoc hypothesis which one can add to make ones theory seem correct. I really felt that the author needed to read a good book on the topic such as ""Philosophy of Science"" by Curd.There are better books on audible on this topic. The author showed a lack of depth on philosophy. I did not learn anything new from reading this book and an author should always assume their reader is interested in the topic and tell them things they didn't already know. I wish I had built a time machine and was able to read this review and then save myself from having read this book which is nothing more than a rehash of stuff told in other books. "
1,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952890-dr-zorlak,2,"A supremely embarrassing book by the lamest science popularizer around. I should have learned my lesson with the incredibly boring Physics for Future Presidents, but I forgot the author's name.If you want to learn about the concept of ""now"", that fleeting sensation of the present moment, this is not the book where you will learn anything, new or not. Muller's thesis is simple, stated at the beginning and again at the end of the book as some sort of big reveal: ""now"" is the feeling of new time being constantly created by the Big Bang (just like space is always being created by the Big Bang). No explanations, no evidence, nothing.The rest of the book is the same old, constantly regurgitated episodes: the cat, the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein saying that his universal constant was his biggest blunder, Dirac, Eddington, blah blah blah.He does present some very interesting new ways for thinking about entropy, but that's about it. The last two chapters are unbelievable: timidly, skulking, tip-toeing, Muller posits the existence of a spiritual realm and defends (weakly but clearly) the thesis that non-physical phenomena exist, right after calling physicalism a religion.I wish I was making this up.He also tackles the problem of free will and empathy (he apparently tackled every topic except ""NOW"") in such an amateurish, parochial manner, that one cannot help but think that he hasn't read the first book about neuroscience. Scientists shipwrecked in their own islands of wisdom.Thoroughly disappointing and a waste of time."
2,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40334778-cj-dufficy,1,"It should be titled ""Pride and Prejudice"" did someone use that already?This book is not named correctly. Very little of the book can really be said to relate to the title. There are two points that resulted in me downgrading the persuasiveness of the book and they relate to the authors disposition shining through. Firstly, he is stuck in the perennial and parochial theorist/experimenter friction. He knows well that it is the current technology deficit that precludes experiments to falsify theory's which depend on probing to a smaller scale with so far unattainable energies, these deficits may or may not be overcome (experimenters job) but this surely is not a reason to suspend theoretical physics or to constrain its creative imperative which his (well provided elsewhere) history so clearly demonstrates the success of. Secondly, and more damning though is the statement around ""his soul"" that if you don't agree with him then you don't understand what he is talking about. There are many circular arguments and internal inconsistencies which I believe above two examples are striking enough to undermine the authors credibility. Mostly arising from not only an anthropocentric view but more ignorantly a western educated view from privilege, he even cites QE2 as an inspirational figure that influenced his child's name (Dante has a special place in hell for those inspired by the outcome of arbitrary benefits at birth afforded to no other). Whether we have free will or not in the exceptionally limited area where it may manifest itself (about 30% of thought is ever expressed by the thinker, I suppose much less has material consequence) is irrelevant on the scale of the universe (about 2 trillion galaxies observable). We cannot decide to be hungry or thirsty or in a fatal accident etc. That we can decide what to eat (if we have means) is surely of fractional importance compared to the uncontrollable nature of hunger (hunger clearly arises from fundamental physics). Over the grand passage of universal time Achims razor I feel would tend toward human free will as a statistical irrelevance rather than Mueller's soul; but who knows? Nobody at present!. Ultimately as I've seen before he falls victim to the crimes of those he accuses, in this I mean he believes what he wants to believe rather than the implications of current evidence to hand, except unlike a true scientist he makes statements like above which preclude further progress on the topic. It does not matter what blue looks like or what a word sounds like. It matters that we understand its meaning, only 100 words are shared across all languages, but they all create poetry, literature, comedy etc. It's the shared understanding not the intrinsic letters or sounds that matters. By the way Mr Mueller math does probe poetry, art, music and language in all kinds of fascinating patterns (eg. see Ziph's law). In order for language to emerge it simply must have sprung from a well where humans acted and thought without it (see Noam Chomsky). I think he deeply confuses at a fundamental level the difference between understanding the cosmos and its physics with understanding our place in it and whether its consequential or not, from this misunderstanding he launches wholly unwarranted and disingenuous criticisms on other people and others opinions. The references used are scify movies sprinkled with (as is usual in physics books) very selective Greek philosopher quotations, without contextualizing them or asking himself what would those great thinkers believe today with the accumulated knowledge we make our views upon? A very illuminating example of his either deliberate or worse his understanding of evolution is so poor he should not be commenting on it in a book he wants people to pay for; is using evolution to demonstrate free will by making the nonsense conclusion that the contradictory consequences of altruism prove his point. Any book on the subject (whether by Dawkins or not) will clearly show the imperfections of evolution, 99% of species are extinct, need more proof than that? No evolutionary biologist claims it a perfect system only that it's potentially a perfect explanation when completed but very impressive right now and continuously affirmed by observation and study of the fossil record. Furthermore he should know (and probably does) that genes can work in concert and their expression can be triggered by environment as well as internally with many unintended consequences that are either deleterious, irrelevant or positive for genes survival. Also culturally (mainly through lies from leaders about better futures) ideas can dominate even though again deleterious, irrelevant or positive to society, religion being a fine example, make your own choice?I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in the physics of time. Its a short history from Einstein to today loosely harping back to time almost as if he realizes he's miles off topic, added to this a list of the unknowns or unknowable's plus his dogma for good measure. I'd strongly recommend Alan Lightman (the accidental universe) for the fine prose version, Lee Smollin (Time Reborn) for the physics of time and What we cannot know by Alan du Sautoy on the subject of scientific limts and David Deutsch (Beginning of Infinity) for the lack of them. Then make up your own mind which will feel better than accepting this dogma on faith. An emphatic 1-star. The real reason for the book appears to be a dog whistle to claim science is religion after he ""ranted"" that hijacking words is almost criminal. And therefore science and religion are equivalent and one not preeminent over the other in terms of enlightening us about reality. All the Augustinian quotes underline the subtlety of the persuasion being attempted. If science is a religion it is surely one without dogma if practiced according to its method, it only preaches the seeking of knowledge where it can be sought, it never suggests violence to opposing views or blind faith where zero evidence exists. Claiming kinship at least intellectually to Richard Feynman seems a prerequisite to get published these days, I doubt Dr Feynman would find much to agree with in the conclusions and assertions in this book. I particularly remember seeing him on YouTube complain that audiences to science are always looking for the unknown instead of appreciating how far knowledge has come and trying to assimilate it and gain understanding of our current approximation. With a completely open mind to what may come that disproves or sharpens that approximation. (See Beauty, Richard Feynman on YouTube and Horizon Feynman meets Hoyle also YouTube)"
3,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11305664-michelle-podsiedlik,2,"The sections on physics history and understanding (the first half of the book) are competent and in the style of Muller's very good ""Physics for Future Presidents."" But Muller's personal asides and grievances enter the scene until ""Now"" becomes a philosophical agenda book (which would be fine, but it's not the book described on the inside flap or by marketing).This book should have been titled ""Free Will: Physicalism Can't Explain it All,"" not ""Now: The Physics of Time."" The actual discussions of ""Now"" - and Muller's theory of it being created continually like new space - contain only a few paragraphs of information which he simply repeats over and over for about fifteen pages at the end.A good editing pass was needed for ""Now."" Much of what Muller says in the last third of the book (about souls and free will) is unfocused and contradictory. Many of his asides don't contribute to the main theme (or, if they do, he did a poor job linking them).I hugely recommend Muller's ""Physics For Future Presidents,"" but would tell you to skip this one unless you're interested in a scientist's thoughts on free will."
4,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57297326-andrew-montgomery,1,"If you were hoping to learn more about the author's hypothesis about ""now"", read only the Introduction. Every single thought he has specifically relating to his idea of ""now"" is spelled out in the Introduction. Throughout the entire book, he doesn't get any more specific about this concept. ""Part V: Now"" is literally a long-winded recap of parts I - IV, with the same frustratingly brief—and vague—description of ""now"" and the flow of time.The rest of the book appears to be something of a ""random walk"" (to borrow a phrase he discusses, for some reason) through ""an enormity of material,"" as he strangely warns us in his introduction. To be fair, it was clear to me that the author intended to (eventually) knit these seemingly poorly-related topics together. But he rarely offers more than a sideways glance in the direction he wants you to go.Instead, he repeats himself—ad nauseam. I hate skimming books, especially books I am excited about. By the middle of this book, however, I found myself needing to skip whole paragraphs of repetitions, just to keep my thoughts straight.The good news was that among his many repetitive ramblings, he manages to give a decent review of Relativity and Quantum physics. He offers several very useful alternative presentations for subjects that are usually more confusing than they need to be. If you've been interested in either of these topics, but frustrated with your unanswered questions, this book might actually help you. But only if you can wade through the rest of the book, of course.The most frustrating (and seemingly pointless) part of this entire book, for me, at least, was his quixotic defense of ""free will"". He goes on and on about it, in multiple chapters. He absolutely rails against anyone who has ever claimed that the universe is purely deterministic, including Einstein—whom he otherwise clearly adores. But the very best argument he presents for the existence of free will is that physics can't (yet) rule it out, since pure determinism (which he derisively blames on physicalists, like Einstein) cannot withstand the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Since two perfectly identical radioactive particles will behave differently, decaying at different times, their behavior is not purely determined by their past, but is instead random (within certain boundaries). And I'm not making this up, he actually ""jokingly"" suggests that those particles have ""free will"":""I may not have free will,"" he quips, defensively, ""but these [pi mesons] sure appear to have it,"" willfully conflating the concepts of ""random"" and ""unpredictable"". He's as serious as you'll let him be. For the author, it seems, ""random behavior based on probabilistic functions"" is where ""free will"" hides. Despite the large amount of words dedicated to the subject, however, he never really comes around to the relevancy of his incessant rants on free will. The best we get is that:""Now [the moment in time] is the only moment when we can exercise influence, the only moment when we can direct entropy away from ourselves so that we can orchestrate local entropy to decrease. Such local decrease is the source of expanded life and civilization. To direct entropy in that way, we must have free will—a capability that physicalists call an illusion, even though current quantum physics theory has similar behavior built into its essence.""Then, in the very next paragraph, after claiming that there is only one way for us to direct entropy (e.g. via free will), he goes on to discuss how free will could be falsified. He then throws in a completely random guess about someday finding a ""special reference frame for causality,"" casually tossing out the Lemaître frame as a ""top candidate"". Full stop, end of discussion. Sure, let's go with that—whatever it takes to save his inexplicably precious free will.On a few occasions, he throws someone under the bus for a crime he will soon commit himself. When discussing Dirac's prediction of the positron, he says, ""it is much more comforting to discover that you can explain a previously known mystery, such as the magnetism of the electron, than to be forced to make a prediction [that the positron exists].... His defensive excuse that the 'probability [of experimentally finding the positron] is negligible' is wrong."" Harsh, perhaps, but seemingly fair.The author, however, is much more forgiving of his own limitations. After spending uncounted pages savagely railing against several pillars of science for suggesting theories that made the cardinal sin of not being falsifiable, and then finally—if vaguely—conveying his own theory, he dutifully makes an attempt to provide a theoretical method for falsifying his own theory. By his own admission, however, his first proposal for falsifying his theory encounters a problem that appears to be ""intractable."" Is he, too, guilty of the sin of hawking an unfalsifiable idea as a theory? Fear not, gentle reader. ""[He takes] heart in the fact that when Dirac proposed his positron, he believed there was no way to detect it for the foreseeable future."" So it's all good. Dirac started it.I definitely enjoyed several parts of this book, most notably the parts that reviewed the inner workings of Relativity and quantum physics. I was consistently frustrated, however, by the author's personal tirades and seemingly frivolous tangents. It happens so often that on one occasion, the author finally asks for permission before beginning yet another rant, saying, ""Excuse me for a moment while I rant about sciencespeak."" He then launches into a completely irrelevant, brutal tirade:""I ask, by what right does a scientist tell us that the American buffalo isn't a buffalo? Or that a spider is not an insect? Or that Pluto is not a planet? Scientists attempt to hijack these words and then tell us when we can and cannot use them. They didn't make up these words, so they don't have the right to narrow their definitions.""It baffles me why he thinks a scientists—a person who specifically and diligently seeks new understanding—should not be allowed to refine the words we use to discuss the world. But his brash stubbornness immediately gets worse:""In my mind, an American buffalo is an American buffalo. In the 1600's, not only spiders but even earthworms and snails were called insects.""Is he suggesting that we should go back to a time when earthworms and snails were called insects? Perhaps he's reminding us that, since it used to be much worse, we should be fine with a little sloppiness in our current nomenclature. Whatever the case, though, he's not finished yet:""I once had a mathematician tell me that I couldn't tie a knot in my shoelace, because by mathematical definition, anything that can be untied is not a knot!""When this mathematician overlooks the homonyms of the word 'knot', presumably to highlight an interesting and distinguishing fact about knots in mathematics, rather than choosing to enjoy the academic exploration of mathematical knots, the author chooses to be insulted, or even offended. The knit-picky sciencespeak has gone too far for the author.Yet, shortly after his blinding rant about scientists using sciencespeak to hijack words they didn't invent, he pulls the same trick in a chapter about black holes entitled, ""Actually, There Are No Black Holes"":""Why do I say that there are no true black holes on the list [of black holes in Wikipedia]? Recall the calculation showing that it takes infinite time to fall into a black hole..."" He goes on to say that, due to relativity, the matter that collapsed to form the black hole has not finished falling yet—and will never quite finish. He quickly apologizes, however:""I am being somewhat pedantic. It takes forever to fall into a black hole, but you get pretty far in just a few minutes, in your own proper time measured by your own co-falling watch. From the outside frame you'll never reach the surface, but you'll be turned into a crepe-like object in relatively short order. So, in some sense, it hardly matters.""One mans outrageously offensive sciencespeak is another man's somewhat pedantic hijacking of words, it would seem.There were, unfortunately, many, many frustrating, self-aggrandizing editorials throughout the book. That, it turns out, is a significant problem, since it can be difficult to distinguish between his opinion and helpful context.For this reason alone, I recommend finding another book."
5,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I enjoyed reading Muller’s book, maybe as much for its loose ends as its clear discussions along the way. He combines a reconstruction of some basics of relativity and quantum physics with an over-riding question — time’s arrow and our experience of a “now” in time — and a general, philosophical position on the limits of scientific knowledge. And, despite the subject matter, it’s written in an almost breezy manner, although you’ll certainly find yourself going back to read passages a second or third time to understand subtle points.The bulk of the book really is Muller’s laying out of his own understanding of the current landscape of physics and cosmology.It deserves being called a “reconstruction” because he seeks to overturn some popular scientific misconceptions along the way. The expansion of the universe, for example, does not mean that galaxies are moving away from one another, but that the space between them is expanding. That may seem like a difference between two ways of describing the same thing, but the difference will become important later when Muller addresses the question of time, “now”, and time’s arrow. Just as space is continually created by cosmological expansion, he will claim that time is also expanding.He also corrects the popular construction of space-time as three axes of space and a fourth time axis, similar to the spatial axes. That popular picture gives us the impression of a linear expanse of time — past, present, and future — on which we just happen to sit at a point we call the present, as if future and past also existed as accessible points, at least in principle. Again, correcting this picture will play an important part in his own conception of time later in the book.Muller devotes extensive discussions to indeterminacy and entropy. He recounts Einstein’s opposition to indeterminacy as an objective characteristic of reality. This is part of his general argument that physics is “incomplete”. Despite Einstein’s protests, indeterminacy actually does turn out to be a feature of objective reality. The common sense determinism of scientific thought, that the past determines the future, turns out to be false. Physics, in turn, is incomplete, in that it cannot compute the future even given complete knowledge of the past and present. The idealized “complete” knowledge of the past and present — the position and velocity of all particles — is unobtainable, because there simply are no such determinate, objective positions and velocities.His discussion of entropy takes up the perhaps dominant explanation of time’s arrow, by Arthur Eddington — that the arrow of time is the arrow of increasing entropy. Muller considers Eddington’s account in some interesting discussions of the relation between local entropy and cosmological entropy. Certainly we, through intentional activity, can decrease local entropy. Our experience of time’s arrow is not one of ever-increasing entropy. Muller wants us to see that, in an important sense, the idea that time as entropy cannot go backwards is illusory — local entropy certainly does go backwards. The familiar illustration of entropy’s direction — reversing the film sequence of a cup breaking, now showing the pieces of the cup bizarrely flying together — is misleading. Cups do actually come together, reversing entropy, when we make them.I’m unsure exactly how to understand the relation between the problem of time’s arrow in physics and the importance that Muller gives to the human experience of time (and local entropy). But he certainly does mean to claim that physics turns out to be incomplete in another sense beyond that implied by objective indeterminacy. That other sense of incompleteness has to do with conscious experience, such as our conscious experience of time.Muller is a scientist who does not think the reach of scientific knowledge is complete — there are phenomena beyond the reach of scientific knowledge. In particular, science cannot grant us knowledge of conscious phenomena, e.g., what it is like to see blue. We can certainly have scientific accounts of what happens when we are conscious (e.g., that certain areas of the brain are active), but that is not a description of the conscious experience itself (see Thomas Nagel’s classic paper, “What Is It Like to be a Bat?” for a fuller treatment of the problem, although Muller doesn’t cite Nagel).All of these themes come together toward the end of the book in Muller’s speculations about “now”. The direction of time, and our position at “now”, are not adequately explained by our current physics. Our experience of “now” is likewise unaccounted for in physics (actually our conscious experience of anything is unaccounted for by physics).We do however, from quantum physics, have a way of distinguishing the past from the present and the future. What separates the past from “now” is the determination of the past — quantum uncertainty has been resolved in the past (through “measurement” — a still mysterious natural process that collapses the wave function of quantum physics). In the present, and in the future, no such determination has occurred. In fact, Muller thinks that time is continuously created, just as space is, in the cosmological expansion of the universe.The claim is speculative, and probably requires a lot more physics (especially concerning measurement). But Muller offers some thoughts on experiments we might make to go forward.Muller’s claims on indeterminacy, local entropy, and the unattainability of scientific accounts of conscious experience also lead him to some conclusions about free will. Certainly indeterminacy is not the same thing as free will — indeterminacy has nothing to do with intentional behavior. But indeterminacy at least may remove one obstacle to accepting free will, that our future actions are not strictly determined by the past or present. His account of free will is, like his account of the continuous creation of “now”, speculative, but interesting. He would like to say that, since “now” and the future are undetermined, in the physical sense, they are open to willful determination — explained by him as generation of local decreases in entropy. Those local decreases are the province of life and its productions (order, structure, intentional action . . . civilization).In my own understanding, from reading Muller, the marriage of all of these themes isn’t really consummated. The flow of time, free will, and what blue looks like are all phenomena that appear not to be well understood, certainly by science, and possibly will never be understood by scientists. I’m just not sure how all are related to one another, or if “now” does not turn out to be inextricable from the conscious experience that Muller thinks cannot be adequately described in scientific terms.But Muller is refreshingly provocative. And I think it is especially refreshing, in not only a scientific but a scientistic age, to find a physicist who does not think that physics can encompass everything.One minor quibble. Well maybe not minor. Muller delves deeply into some important philosophical problems — the status of conscious experience, free will, the limits of objective knowledge. And he does discuss some philosophical treatments of those issues. But, given that he teaches at a university with one of the world’s leading philosophy departments, there’s no evidence (that I could find in the book) that he’d actually walked over to the philosophy department to find out what they thought. Doing so may have substantially enriched and applied additional rigor to his treatments of those issues."
6,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834122-vegantrav,3,"Now is worth reading if only for the author's interesting theory on the generation of the arrow of time. A widely popular view among physicists is that the arrow of time can be explained by entropy: the universe grows ever more disorganized and chaotic, and it is this direction towards increased disorder that accounts for the arrow of time. Richard Muller presents arguments against this view and provides his own theory to replace it. These sections of the book are the best.There are many intervening sections in which Muller presents some of the basics of cosmology, relativity, and quantum theory. There is little new or enlightening in these sections, but for the reader unfamiliar with these areas, this book is a solid introduction.Be forewarned, though: Muller, who is himself a physicist with a number of outstanding achievements in his areas of research, decides, in this book, to dabble in metaphysics. He addresses religion, ethics, and free will, and he has read just enough philosophy to sound like he knows what he is talking about, but his arguments in these areas leave much to be desired. To take just one point: Muller seems to think that quantum indeterminacy somehow is an argument in favor of free will; he clearly has not read (or at least if he has read has not absorbed) any contemporary philosophical work addressing this issue, nor does it seem to have occurred to him that if his ""free"" decision is the result of a quantum fluctuation, it is still highly problematic that his ""free"" decision is based on something (namely, the quantum fluctuation) beyond his own control. He also seems never to have heard of philosophical compatibilism and therefore believes that the only two options are hard determinism or philosophical libertarianism. Muller's novel approach to the arrow of time makes this book worth reading (at least those sections), but one would do well to pass over entirely every word he says about free will, religion, consciousness, and ethics."

But when it started to halfheartedly discredit modern physics, drag and derail, I read some reviews here on goodreads. Apparently, it becomes more of a philosophical discussion of free will than actual science. Very disappointing indeed. "
8,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15078897-ryan-young,2,"why do physicists always think they are sooooo cool and edgy? ugh. muller starts out with a pretty easy to grasp refresher of relativity, cosmology, and quantum physics. he adds the conjecture that in addition to creating new space, the big bang is continuously creating new time, which is what humans experience as the fleeting sense of 'now.' we exist on the eternal boundary of the 4th dimension, experiencing time's flow only because of these new moments. it's interesting to think consider what would happen if that new time ceased to be created.anyway, the book's novelty was that ""4d big bang,"" which could have been imparted in a tweet much more easily. then muller pissed me off by positing a 'spiritual realm' while at the same time railing against people believing things that are unproven. somehow, this concept of now tells him that he has a soul and free will. but please don't ask him how one leads to the others. read my tweet, ""what if we are riding the crest of a wave of new time?"" and skip the book.

9,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Time and physics are inherently fascinating. I enjoyed Carlo Rovelli's The Order of Time more, but Muller managed to add some depth. The more I listen and read about the different theories, the more time seems to be tied to information transfer. Schrodinger's cat enters time when information is transferred. Before that the cat is beyond time in a here/not here limbo. We feel time and realize it can't go backward, because information is a one way ticket. Maybe this is just a classic example of the current zeitgeist (information technology) informing in how I look at the world, but, yeah, you can't go back an unread this can you. Think of this as Schrodinger's review. "

11,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15714659-emma,4,"Perhaps deceivingly, this book does not spend much time going deep into the physics/concept of now. However, if you are interested in modern physics and all the twists and turns, the unexpected interpretations of reality that relativity and quantum physics has led us to, this is a well written and page-turning book. Review of interesting topics:- time is relativistic. If the frame of reference is adjusted, it is possible for two events to seem simultaneous, first before the second, or second before the first- time invariance (laws of physics are same every moment in time) -> conservation of energy (Emmy Noether)- existence of tachyons (particles that travel faster than light) implies no free will (with tachyons it is possible that in some frame of reference, the order of cause & result are reversed.) -the time it takes to reach a black hole is infinite because of relativity of time. unless there were primordial black holes, no completed black holes exist (it will take infinite time to form a completed back hole)- entropy is the logarithm of the number of quantum states accessible to a system. Exercise free will by limiting ""accessible"" states. -the universe is expanding in an accelerated pace. New space is being created at an accelerated pace. More space implies more ways to fill the universe and thus higher max entropy. Our low observed entropy (highly organized) universe results from this. - right after the big bag, quantum fluctuations from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle would cause small lumps that would grow from local gravity, forming structures that would eventually become large-scale clusters of galaxies. - violation of T symmetry has been found. elementary particle interactions can be determined to be running forward or backward. - there is no definition of what ""measurement"" means in quantum physics. the quantum wave function cannot be measured. when measured it collapses to a simpler function.- the Planck length results from the uncertainty principle, which implies that a small region of ""empty"" space cannot have 0 energy (certain energy). if the region is sufficiently tiny, using the Schwarzschild formula, the vacuum will have a microscopic black hole. so it has been proposed that perhaps space is digitized separated by roughly a Planck length. - positrons are theoretically equivalent to electrons moving backward in time. Inspecting a Feynman diagram of ways an electron can scatter of a positron, is it easy to see the interaction as an electron being bounced backwards in time. Wheeler suggested that perhaps all electrons have the same mass and charge because they are the same electron, bouncing forward and backward in time. - Godel's theorem states that all mathematical theories are incomplete, and will contains truths that cannot be proved. Physics using mathematics is also incomplete. - particles that are identical in every aspect at the quantum level (same wave function/charge etc etc) may decay at different times. The author argues that this shows that even if we had every piece of information about the past and present, we still cannot predict the future, and this proves the existence of free will.- author denounces physicalism, which is the belief that anything not based on logic, reason, and cannot be readily quantified is not a part of reality. - finally, the arrow of time is not caused by entropy (Eddington). the author speculates that time is being constantly created just like space. The big bang set this into motion. The later bits:Starting from chapter 22 Cogito Ergo Sum, the book veers off track into the realms of philosophy and religion, and becomes more polemic than science. The writing suffers here, and the ideas are repeated frequently, often with the same wording. This doesn't make his arguments more convincing, and it sounds like ranting. Because he veered so far off from his own field, (into evolution, and empathy, and virtue), even I could spot numerous flaws in his arguments. The last few chapters are short and still worth a quick read. "
12,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66477960-colin-fahrion,2,"The first half of the book is an entertaining look at the history of physics, the people and how the ideas evolved — very little I hadn't read elsewhere but it was entertaining all the same. The second half was ""old man yells at cloud"" of freshman level philosophy against ""physicalism"" and atheism and promoting the idea of freewill and the soul. Mostly it's a lot of straw man arguments and him just shooting from the hip. Not only did this whole mess come out of nowhere but it struck as hypocritical since Muller spends much of the book railing against theories that weren't testable. Also as someone who has read a lot on the nature of freewill, I'm flummoxed that Muller completely ignored all of the neuropsychological research on freewill. His proof that we have freewill is basically ""we can't predict the decay of particles perfectly, thus the world isn't totally deterministic so we must have freewill!"". Which is like claiming that Grandma is telling the truth that she came from Mars because we don't have a copy of her birth certificate. His proof that we have souls is even worse as it boils down to ""we have empathy, thus we have souls."" Showing how shallow he's thought he does mention how sociopaths are missing empathy but then doesn't make 2+2 with his own statement since by his proof this would mean that sociopaths are missing souls — lets ignore the fact that sociopathology is more complicated than that. Oh apparently according to Muller gorillas have souls too — thanks book that is supposed to be about physics for illuminating me on that piece of info. The last sliver of the book finally hits upon the concept that Now is a result of new time being created as the universe grows and adds more space-time. This is supposed to be what the entire books is about but it barely touches on the topic. Seriously, I've read more in-depth discussions on twitter. Muller mentions the idea, mentions there is one or two ways it might be experimentally tested, and then leaves it at that. What I wanted to read was what the ramifications were of this theory. If this is the reason we have a Now then what does that mean for other aspects of physics, what does it mean for the universe? But Muller never touches on that, instead he just circles back to his sophomoric rant on freewill."
13,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10615847-jason,4,"Well, I ain't no scientist. And I am not a regular reader of books on physics. Since some of the issues discussed in Muller's book pertain to issues long mused-upon by philosophers, however, I am not entirely unfamiliar w/ discourse upon the issues under consideration. It is in fact the philosopher Henri Bergson who has most informed my own ideas of time, and much of what he wrote - the very nature of his placement of the manifold of the temporal - has famously inspired and been confirmed by much subsequent physics (Einstein was a fan). Muller never references Bergson, but for a reader of Bergson there is much here that will hardly be unfamiliar in terms of the basic attitude to the human experience of Now, although there is an especially significant divergence in where the book ends up in terms of its situation of the future. A problem I have w/ early Bergson is a problem I also have w/ Muller: the conceptualization of free will. Muller advocates for the rehabilitation of the concept. I am not sold. It is impossible for me to accept that will is ever actually free, and I do not think 20th century progress in quantum physics does anything to problematize my conviction (though I concede that neither does it confirm it). The conclusion Muller arrives at regarding the Now is actually in a sense underwhelming in its fundamental common-sense-type simplicity, though it does indeed diverge from what I have come to understand. In this sense the book radicalizes how I am prepared tot think about time. The main reason I read the book was because I am preparing to write a piece in which entropy plays a significant role, and I wanted to get a better sense of how the second law of thermodynamics works in terms of time. The book did indeed help me in this regard. A good book, then, and recommended for neophytes like myself. "
14,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7115533-friedrick,4,"I picked this book up because I was always seeing reports of distant (I mean across the universe distant) events being described with Earth-bound time frames. I suspected that for very far distant events, Earth-bound time was (is?) meaningless. I'm also fascinated with the physics of time. I learned a very great deal, including about time dilation across black holes, that seemed to confirm my original suspicion that Earth-bound time is meaningless when applied to far distant events. But, I'm not smart enough to tell. I think another timescale (like stardates from Star Trek or something) would be just as invalid, so if Earth-bound time scales makes us feel more comfortable, why not?"
15,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5775132-scott,2,"This book boils down to an unsubstantiated proposition: that the supposed flow of Time is really just the creation of time, occurring alongside the expansion of space (space time). The author waits until the final six pages to reveal this. Significant portions of this book wander off into diatribes against “physicalism,” a supposed pseudo religion and evangelizing the possibility that there are “truths” beyond those that are quantifiable.If you want to learn about time, you’d be better served finding yourself a copy of Sean Carroll’s From Eternity to Here. This book was very disappointing."

17,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66086616-fanie-oosthuysen,5,"I think many reviews are unfair on this book, if you expected to learn something new in physics you don’t understand the current state of physics. I liked it, the authors philosophical perspective on his work in experimental physics, the distance and interplay between the the experimentalists and theoretical physisits and his axioms relating to religion as developed over his lifetime is evident and we'll presented. As for learning about time. He presents some hypothesis and possible experimental directions to prove or disprove them. Some reviewers claim this is not the case. I suspect they missed it due to their distaste possibly induced by the authors wisdom on the constraints of human thought."
18,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5347840-sean,3,"“Shipwrecked on their own islands of wisdom,” I read in another review here, describing experts who just don’t know how much they don’t know outside their own field. A very uneven book that’s well worth reading through chapter 20 before throwing the rest into the nearest black hole.It’s the first physics book I’ve read since the Higgs boson and gravitational waves were discovered, and the first one I’ve read by an experimentalist. Muller co-discovered dark energy in the late 90s. He also, earlier, co-discovered and -mapped the structure of the cosmic background radiation, providing evidence that the entire universe could be a quantum fluctuation. That’s a perspective worth hearing from. The ostensible point of the book - his theory about “now” - is absolute junk, but like many of these books popularizing physics, the meat of it is that it’s one more version of how to explain and grok on some level those irresistible mysterious deep ideas about the world - relativity, quantum mechanics, and the Big Bang - that are otherwise guarded by and for an elite priestly class behind decades of rigorous initiation rituals involving esoteric magic spells (i.e. math).And so I’m happy that this book actually has a bit of simple math in it; it’s patronizing and insulting to censor it like so many authors do, and it really just helps things be a little less abstract, ironically. I’m not sure how understandable the verbal text would be to a reader who doesn’t have prior background in these topics anyway. I just say that because I started reading it while I was in the middle of a huge Wikipedia binge on related topics and I’m sure that helped me follow along, but it still seems like I partly needed the help because of it being pedagogically messy and not just because of the subject matter. What I mean is, whenever he’s referring to background knowledge you do have, his explanations are really clear, but if you forget something he said earlier, or if he’s referencing something he just assumes you know that’s not in the book, you might get lost. The overall arc and the individual topics seem cohesive but on the medium scale I’m not sure what the thread of logic is that crosslinks ideas across sections, and that’s another way you could get lost.That and the asides have something weird about them - it reminds me of how I can’t suppress my own tangential thoughts that seem so useful and interesting but which tie more to my internal web of associations than to considerations about my “audience.” It feels like he didn’t work out a very clear idea of who his target audience is and what they know and don’t know. Aside from the question of general background knowledge, what I can say is that he seems to presume his readers to be middle class (and probably white) parents whose pop culture touchstones are things like Star Trek and who are not in trouble with the law (e.g. he trots out the old “but if there is no free will then how can we put bad guys in prison” canard as though metaphysical moral judgment were the reason “we” put “them” in prison rather than racial and socioeconomic disparity and corporate prison profits). If I ever go to jail I sure hope they let me read about that universe that’s outside my cell.But as far as the random associations aspect (I’ll say with a sad wry smile and rolled eyes), that’s something about the writing that worked for me. He doesn’t come across too charismatic now - a bit self-important with arguments from self-authority (“I myself observed x so it’s extra true,” though that’s not so bad under the idea that his experimentalist insider perspective is uniquely valuable) - but I’d probably have been really stimulated by his lectures as a student.He did explain a lot of physics concepts really well for where I’m at and I feel like I understand it all so much better than before. That’s the biggest reason I would recommend the book. It’s what makes up the bulk of it, even though it’s mostly just the setup for putting forth his own theory.Along the way he successfully put Einstein on a pedestal and gave me that rare (for me) feeling of being willingly united with the rest of humanity in admiring something. I also liked learning about Richard Feynman, who is underrepresented in what I’d previously read. And it’s refreshing to see Emmy Noether get her due.The thesis is basically that the conventional interpretation of time as a mathematical abstraction that’s illusory on our part is wrong and that maybe the universe’s expansion is 4D and not just 3D, that new time is being created, and that’s what “now” is. I could’ve dreamed that up, in fact I did literally dream it, and that’s why I just HAD to read this. But the strength of the argument is in clearing the ground, not in the speculation. I am just really really satisfied with his takedown of the notion that entropy causes the arrow of time. I’ve never found that theory satisfying yet have only been vaguely aware of my discomfort with it.But yeah. With that ground cleared, suddenly at Chapter 21 it all goes to shit. It’s like he thinks his “now” theory is the only thing left once these disagreements with other physicists like about the arrow of time are resolved in his favor, so there’s no need to actually develop or defend it much further than what’s on the inside cover. He does speculate that probing the universe’s expansion rate at an earlier stage than is possible currently could yield a deviation from what would be expected if it were just space that’s expanding, but the reader can’t even tell how much any actual math has been done to specify that hypothesis with enough precision to know if it’s even plausible, and it certainly isn’t obvious how we go from a narrowly technical experiment like that to explaining the “flow” of time. I can visualize spacetime as having an “edge” from which more spacetime “grows” or accretes, but why should it expand from an “edge” and not stretch from within? Which, in the case of time…would that equate to materializing the present on top of the past or actually inserting more time into the past (or even the future)? I am just making this issue up though. He doesn’t actually address anything about what time’s expansion would look like and I of course don’t know how to use general relativity to reason about what kinds of spacetime transformations are possible.But that much at least qualifies as speculation. Most of this part of the book doesn’t reach the lofty status of speculation. Speculation is wondering about the unknown, based what is considered known. That’s not quite the same thing as asserting answers to ill-posed questions based on utter ignorance about not what NO ONE knows, but what LOTS of others know.Since the essential difference between “now” as we intuitively understand it (which we really don’t of course), vs. “time” as it’s modeled in physics, is subjective, you’d think that there’d be some kind of foray into cognitive science, philosophy of mind, neuroscience, something like that. Yeah nope, in fact he seems to even have the naïve notion that the subjective experience of “now” is a simple or precise phenomenon, like the t in a physics equation.He categorically rules out any alternative theories to his, within or outside of physics, that threaten his incredible naïve notion of “free will” which he says right at the beginning of the book is a “religious” feeling of his and that’s how he knows it’s right. Meanwhile he devotes whole chapters to denouncing “physicalism” for being “a religion.” For example, he raises some really interesting questions about thought experiments such as backward time travel through wormholes. But the only consideration strong enough to rule out that (for example) there is any such thing as tachyons (particles that go faster than light and hence back in time) is that to avoid causality violations the future would have to be predetermined to not change the past (technical term: hard determinism). And the only reason that is unacceptable for him (he’s otherwise open to anything the physics might allow) is that it would mean his own personal “soul” wouldn’t have “free will” - but he knows he does have that. He can’t prove it, but there is “nonphysics knowledge,” and to show that he devotes an appendix to proving the irrationality of the square root of 2, SOMEHOW WITHOUT USING PHYSICS.At one point he surprised me by - out of nowhere - actually defining “free will.” He called it “the ability to choose to do something without being externally influenced” - which is a fine definition because it has nothing to do with physics and - best of all - nothing to do with the rest of what he says about it! It’s really sad how confused he is about the fact that the alternative to determinism isn’t free will, it’s just randomness. And this confusion infects anything he connects it to and makes it incoherent, hence for example this fine definition that would render his whole position irrelevant if he followed it through. Even if there is some deeper phenomenon behind the random outcomes quantum physicists observe (which he is hoping some future modification to quantum theory will describe): why any serious theorist would assume that that is their “soul,” and not just some previously unimagined mechanism that has nothing to do with them personally, is escaping me.But then this is right before an appendix on “Physics and God” which is devoted to showing that there are scientists who are theists, followed by a final one titled “Me” that says he prays every day but isn’t sure “to whom.” Maybe it’s to the square root of 2? I’m putting that forward as a serious question, it doesn’t seem any less sensible than any other evaluation you could make of this kind of nonsense being included in a book on physics by a serious scientist."
19,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Unlike some theorists, Muller doesn’t think time is an illusory artifact or that the future is set in stone by a set of quantum physics equations. He thinks time actually exists, and the key to understanding it is to define what we mean by now. This is what he sets out to do. He gets there by summarizing what we do know about time and then stepping into one of its greatest mysteries. Why, unlike just about every other physical process we know of, does time run in only one direction? He incisively dismisses the old, shaky explanation based on the second law of thermodynamics. From there he takes us through relativity and quantum physics and arrives at a startling waypoint: free will.Muller doesn’t claim to prove that free will exists, but he strongly cheerleads in its favor. He also does a good job of showing that the strongest argument against free will—an entirely deterministic physical universe—has been disproven by hardcore physics research. He’s also an enthusiastic booster of dualism, the idea that the mind or spirit, though immaterial, has an existence of its own, perhaps in a sort of parallel universe that can interact with the physical universe. His solid point is that materialism or physicalism—the doctrine that only the quantifiable physical is real—isn’t a scientific outlook because it can’t be scientifically tested. Muller is no fringe kook or New Age guru but right at the center of the scientific establishment—physics professor at Berkeley, a MacArthur “Genius” fellow, and so on. He’s a scientist who humbly (and probably correctly) believes that science can never come close to explaining everything in the world nor solving all its problems.In any event, free will and dualism are not vital to his definition of now. He sees now as the leading edge of the ongoing creation of new time and space begun by the Big Bang. That’s where we live. We can’t move into the past, and the indeterminate future cannot yet exist. He offers several possible experiments to test his ideas and potentially prove them false, which makes the theory scientific. Unfortunately, we don’t yet have the technical means to do the necessary research.He has not convinced me that Occam’s razor can’t slice a few unnecessary complications from his theory. What if time, as an actual entity, doesn’t exist at all? We may find the concept of time handy in adding dimension to our view of things past. It’s also very useful for calculations, but so are negative numbers even though we all agree that there’s no such actual thing as negative-two goldfish in the bowl. Then does space not exist either? We can move through space—we can go back and forth along any of the three spatial dimensions. So why can’t we go backward or forward in time? Maybe simply because there is no such dimension nor any “flow of time,” as Muller sometimes describes it. Everything exists in a perpetually unfolding now. What we call the past is merely a collection of records and remnants, in the now, of “earlier” states. Time is a handy way of thinking about things and computing, but that doesn’t mean it physically exists. Muller calls this mistake, although not in reference to time itself, “interpreting a computational tool as a deep truth.”Muller writes clearly, with enthusiasm and humor, and provides a fascinating, thought-provoking trip through advanced physics and the concept of time in general. That he seems to lead us in a direction that lab-less, math-less mystics have been talking about for millennia by no means detracts from his work. Perhaps just the contrary, to which I think Muller might agree."
20,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18305925-richard-jacobson,3,"To an extent, this book is a collection of isolated observations, many of which have been made before by others. They are strung together, sometimes seemingly at random, sometimes with a sense of purpose but never quite getting to where you think he might be going before veering off in an entirely different direction. Explanations of concepts like entropy, or Noether’s work on the relationship between symmetry and conservation laws, left me feeling like nothing had really been explained, just alluded to. I was captivated by the notion that, as spacetime expands, there is actually new space AND new time being created and I can see how that might explain flow of time—until I realized that, if you think of expanding spacetime, you think of one spacetime that is small, and another that is larger. Those two spacetime must be ordered along some sort of dimension, and it is that dimension which determines which comes before the other. Isn’t that dimension itself temporal in nature? So the question still remains, in my mind, anyway—why is time different from space? This book didn’t address that. "
21,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7270569-tony,5,"Lucid explanations of the history of physics, with an emphasis on what can be proven through observation and experimentation, that veers off into speculation. I was excited to finally read a book about physics that questions the flow of time and points out how unproven the idea is. He has given my intuitive understanding of the idea of time a great deal of accepted scientific background. I was hoping for a more hopeful ending with specific ideas for proving that Now is a distinct state of time, but his vague proposal to distinguish the difference between the red state of light that shows space expanding between galaxies and a possible red shift caused by the acceleration of time was less than I'd hoped for. Still, the possibility that physics will set out to prove the existence of a Now that could serve as a time frame for the entire universe is heartening, and his intuition that no future exists beyond the now is exactly what I have always felt.

23,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Now: The Physics of Time is quite thorough in its scope. Written by Richard A. Muller, the book discusses his personal theories of why time possesses a direction. The question is harder than it seems at first since you must define all of your terms. For instance, what is the past? Why do we remember what has happened rather than what has not happened? This might seem elementary, but it almost requires a tautology to explain. We don’t remember what hasn’t happened because it hasn’t happened yet.Along the way, Muller talks about Relativity and Quantum Physics. Einstein thought of something we take for granted, namely time and simultaneity and threw that notion out the window. According to Relativity, there is no such thing as a universal frame of reference that allows for two events to occur simultaneously under all reference frames. Einstein even had to explain what he meant by “Now,” but he found that difficult as well. How do you explain the concept of Now and not sound like you are talking to a five-year-old?In the main portions of the arguments Muller makes, he points out that a lion’s share of physics contains equations that don’t have a preferred direction in time. You may say that time plays a role in the equations and I would not argue with you there, but think of simple mechanics. If you throw a baseball from the top of a tall building, aren’t there technically two solutions? One doesn’t make sense only because of the frame of the problem. We don’t accept negative time. Many physicists argue that this is because Time is an intrinsic quality of the universe and point to the idea of entropy and how it can only increase.Entropy for those of you not in the know is a concept that I am only familiar with because I read a few books on Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics. Even so, I don’t entirely get the idea of Entropy, so I will turn to a dictionary definition. In Thermodynamics, Entropy is a quantity representing the unavailability of a system’s thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work. Basically, you take gasoline and use it to run an engine. You get waste products from that simple combustion that equal the masses of the gasoline and oxygen put into the system. This is the first law of thermodynamics. The second law states that the process of this is irreversible. Things tend toward disorder and chaos. So many physicists point this out and use this to say that this is why time has an arrow.Professor Muller disagrees though. He comes up with some alternative theories and tells us that Entropy does not determine the arrow of time, it is the other way around. Muller then begins to discuss ideas outside of science, which I found to be fascinating. I have heard of a lot of these arguments before, so none of it was really new to me. Take the idea of teleportation. There is nothing in physics to rule it out as a possibility, but doing so would destroy your original body. Even our perceptions are beyond the realm of physics. Muller illustrates this by talking about how people perceive the color blue. Is my blue your blue? To be more convoluted and precise, is my perception of the color blue the same as yours? It is a question that goes beyond physics. It is like “What is it like to be a bat?” We don’t know how our perceptions would change as a bat. I mean, you can think about what it would be like to have echolocation and fly around eating mosquitoes and other insects but that isn’t the same as having a Chiropteran brain.The final part of the book is a set of six appendices that add to the background of the theories and ideas. The book is really quite enjoyable and interesting, at least to me. I don’t know if it is right or wrong, but the idea is rather compelling."
24,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"I’m not a physicist, definitely not a mathematician—the book knows it too. Now: The Physics of Time might be titled Now...Will be Discussed Later: Because First I Need You to Understand a Lot More About Physics. Personally, I was searching for some science non-fiction after Three-Body Problem left me excited about physics:Physics is very good at predicting the behavior of one or two atoms. It can also handle one or two planets. The toughest realm is when a handful of objects interact. It turns out to be very difficult to predict whether a triple-star system is stable; we know the equations, but math has been unable to “solve” them—that is, to write the solution in terms of the common scientific functions, like exponentials and cosines, that can readily be evaluated.Seeing a reference to the very-real “three body problem” was like when a song references another song you know, or when one of your friends is performing in the play you’re about to see—you feel like you have secret knowledge, some special connection to the material.Now takes this approach and runs with it; take all the things you know about time: the intuitive stuff; the automatic stuff; the bits you don’t even think about; and throw it all out the window. It wants to tell you something, but the something has to come from secret knowledge. You need to be suffused in physics so that there is impact when you start unraveling time; Your song-referencing-another-song knowledge cannot come from daily perception, so that must go, overtaken by a slow but steady rebuilding of where physics is and why time might be what Now says it is.It takes the simple layer: Human perception of the movement of now, the flow of time, seems to be determined by the number of milliseconds it takes to send a signal from the eye or ear or fingertip to the brain and to record and notice and remember. For humans, that’s a few tenths of a second; for a fly, a few thousandths of a second. That’s why it is hard for a human to catch a fly. To a fly, your threatening hand approaches in slow motion. It breaks it apart. It adds the mathematical layer:To calculate the total amplitude, the quantity that gives you the total probability of scattering, you add together the amplitudes for each of the diagrams. That seems reasonable, until you think about it. In the first diagram, the original electron disappears and a newly produced one emerges on the right. In the second one, the same electron enters and leaves. Yet the two processes are happening simultaneously. Physics can’t tell whether the emerged electron is the same or not. In fact, it both is and isn’t. The particles are truly identical, indistinguishable. To repeat, the emerging electron is both the same one that entered and a different one that was created, simultaneously. Shades of Schrodinger’s cat! The probability for the process consists of the amplitudes for both diagrams added together, and then the combination is squared.Remember Feynman’s advice. Don’t think about how this can be so or you will go down the drain.It shreds it.It takes cosmological layer:To say we are looking back in time, we have to make the assumption that the distant universe, 14 billion years ago, was very similar to what our nearby part of the universe was like back then. As I said earlier, that postulate is given a fancy name: the cosmological principle. Specifically, it asserts that the universe is homogeneous (like homogenized milk; it is uniform in composition without big lumps) and isotropic (no special directions; no large-scale organized motion; it isn’t, for example, spinning). If you don’t want other people to realize you are making a drastic assumption, call it a principle. Cosmological principle is an awesome name; if you called it the raisin bread model, it wouldn’t be so compelling. Perfect cosmological principle is an even more awesome name for an extension of the “ordinary” cosmological principle, but it turns out to be wrong.And makes room for doubt to grow.And then it plunks down, after two hundred pages of propping you—the inexperienced reader—on the shoulders of giants, it pushes you off into that great void science. Repeatable, experimentally verifiable, falsifiable hypotheses; it has it all: Is the Big Bang an explosion of 3D space? Yes—but a more reasonable assumption, one closer to the spirit of space-time unification, is that the Big Bang is an explosion of 4D space-time. Just as space is being generated by the Hubble expansion, so time is being created. The continuous and ongoing creation of new time sets both the arrow of time and its pace. Every moment, the universe gets a little bigger, and there is a little more time, and it is this leading edge of time that we refer to as now.Okay, so if you didn’t quite understand the above excerpt—you need to “get” space-time, the Hubble expansion, why we don’t know how to define a quantum measurement, why Einstein was wrong in supporting the Hidden Variable Theory, why Arthur Eddington’s entropy-based Arrow of Time is both wrong and a bad metaphor—then all the background physics you need is available in a very understandable book called Now: The Physics of Time. It isn’t the answer (probably), but it is an answer (definitely), and if you’re intrigued or want to understand more, then read the book. I liked it, and I liked the author, I liked the conversational tone. Review over. Now, though, before I forget or lose the notes; wouldn’t this impact the Drake equation? Given that, from our frame in the Cosmological Principle, we’re the center point of expansion and all the other raisins are moving away from us, those planets would—again, from our perspective—be subject to a time to dilation that is immeasurably vast. Even if they’re advancing at the same rate as we are, from our perspective they’re barely crawling.Put the opposite way: every other galaxy, planet, solar system, they’re all Charlton Heston; from their perspectives, time here on earth would be going incredibly fast. Or would that actually mean, since they’re their own centered raisin, their perceptions from their frame mean that we’re the dilated ones and they are looking out at our dead proto-planet as it stood billions of years ago? If it takes us billions of years to get to where we are, technologically, and the rest of the universe is silent because in our little bubble, we’re having our own tiny slice of now, then we’re never going to be able to see foreign life. Not until we match frames of relativity—until our space-times match. Right? We’re simultaneously the oldest things in the universe, and not even developed yet, depending on where you’re standing. Can we measure ourselves, cogito ergo sum, or will we never fall in line with another part of the universe until we are observed—measured—by something outside ourselves? Wouldn’t other planets be the same, moving at their own simultaneous old/young state until something breaks into their frame? Once we’re observed—measurement taken from another frame—and we snap from our simultaneous fast/slow existence into…wait, where are we now, oldest or youngest?Gosh, Feynman (and Muller) were right—I do feel myself going down the drain…."

His physics answers are so simple and clear, so humble and intuitive. His non-physics answers are at once bold and compelling, clever and novel. In a word, the pinnacle of Quora writers! So naturally, I kept an eye out for his books and finally picked this one up when I found it.As a physics book it does not disappoint. It is every bit as simple and clear and humble and intuitive as it gets. It truly is ""a master class in what time is"", a cherry-picking of all those mind-bending twentieth-century discoveries of relativity and quantum physics which specifically attempt to understand time as a physical concept. Spoiler alert: we don't. That's 90% of the book, and it's as good as they come. If you're well-read in the area, like me, then it won't be anything new, just a more concentrated, curated overview of old material by a masterful teacher. Then 8% consists of Part IV, a well-argued but less-than-convincing philosophical treatment of free will, physicalism, and the human soul.The last 2% consists of Part V, the big reveal of his pet theory, simultaneously compelling and underwhelming. Compelling because it attempts to answer, as no other physical theory does, why we experience the flow of time, a vexing question in the face of a body of physics which treats time as totally static, therefore chalking up our personal feeling of ""flow"" as an illusion. You've got it backwards, he argues. If our theories can't explain our observations and experience, then they're incomplete, a fact we suspected already for other reasons. Underwhelming, because the theory he posits is falsifiable only in principle, requiring some future technology to actually test. I was expecting something like David Deutsch's excellent The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes--and Its Implications. That book is both a master class in the ""many worlds interpretation of quantum physics"" and simultaneously a strong argument for their literal, physical existence, mind-blowing though it may be. Muller, by comparison, throws out his pet theory almost as an afterthought, devoting a few pages to it rather than filling a book with it."
26,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10872522-marko,3,"Now: The Physics of Time is certainly a big undertaking. Muller tries to explain what time is (which is obviously a prerogative of explaining what ""now"" means). This is a hard problem as this is one of the unsolved problems in physics. To achieve this Muller takes some rather long but interesting detours to explain the history of the universe, general relativity and quantum physics among other things. So the book is also a rather useful introduction to those issues as well. Obviously for a single book it's not possible to handle all those theories in detail but for a layman like me it was plenty enough. I'm not totally unfamiliar with them so I'm not sure how well Muller manages to explain them if the reader is completely unfamiliar. On the other hand I do think this book is best consumed if the reader has some rudimentary knowledge about physics. Armed with some knowledge the reader is rewarded with easily understandable (as far as easy can be applied to modern physics) explanations about many of the difficult concepts that arise from general relativity and quantum physics such as causality, time dilation and wave function collapse.According to Muller, time is created just like space is created in spacetime. This makes sense because modern physics already sees time just as one of the dimensions along with the other three dimensions. So why wouldn't it also be created at the same.. ahem, time? Now is just the edge of this creation of time. So we are at the very tip of time, there is no future yet and therefore we shouldn't expect any visitors from the future.All in all, Muller does a good job in explaining a huge amount of modern physics as well as a lot of history behind those theories and in my opinion explains what time and ""now"" is. It is obviously just a theory and I'm not sure if it can even be tested but it is the best explanation I have seen. On the way to that conclusion reader is also rewarded with a better understanding of many of the other issues so the book is well worth reading for anyone interested in these subjects.The reason I only gave three stars is that there is a bit too much metaphysics and religion at the end of the book. I don't really want to read about that stuff in a physics book. It feels like Muller tries to justify his own beliefs and this does not sit well with the rest of the book at all."
27,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108405025-arun-kannawadi,1,"I felt the book covers a wide range of topics for a non-physics audience in a clear manner, particularly those that many other popular science books have not covered and I very much appreciate Prof. Muller to bring out some of those topics in the light. However, given the title, a casual reader looking to read about those topics might not come across this book at all!While I did phrase the introduction as a positive comment, it is also a negative comment. While being interesting, the book takes you through excruciating details of many other topics that make you wonder if many of those things really matter at all for the topic that the book attempts to address. The book discusses the new ""physics"" of time only in the last and short chapter. The book is not about time, as it appears to be. To be precise, the introduction is nice and comprehensive (Parts I to IV), and occupies 72% of the book content (including appendices, indices, etc.) The chapters about the new physics of time occupy only 4% of the book! And, I wouldn’t call it the physics of time. ""Musings about time"" would have been a title.And the disappointing thing is that this theory does not even make sense! The book contains as much pseudoscience as much as it contains science. The book talks about soul, consciousness, free will etc. From other avenues, I am aware that the author is a person with strong Christian beliefs and he tries to push in the concepts he believes in as scientific concepts. The author also comes off obnoxious, inserting himself in sentences when not necessary.The ""Now theory of time"" can be compressed into a single line:- Prof. Muller hypothesizes that time accelerates just as space accelerates.It might be compelling to think that the acceleration of time is a natural possibility when we phrase the statement as space is accelerating. However, we mean something very specific when we say that space is accelerating. The FRW metric that appears out of the Einstein’s GR equations for a homogenous, isotropic Universe has two free terms - a constant curvature term and a time-varying scale factor. When we mean that the Universe is expanding, we mean that the scale factor is increasing with time. The accelerated expansion of the Universe implies that the rate at which the scale factor increases, increase with time. The book makes no mention of this scale factor anywhere! Given that the appendices cover a fair bit of mathematics, I would expect at least a mention of these terms. The accelerating rate of time has no place in the standard GR cosmology; it is absorbed in the speed of light. For Prof Muller’s hypothesis to be true, general relativity must fail. Prof. Muller doesn’t seem to refute the GR theory of gravity either.P.S.: I have written this and more on my post on Quora: https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-re..."
28,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14088812-rizky-maulana-nugraha,3,"I really respected the author, Richard Muller. He is an excellent scientist, he mentored two Nobel laureates with significant key finding in Physics. I want to acknowledge that before my review.However after finished the book, I can’t help but feeling a little bit disappointed. Ok, maybe not little, but moderately disappointed. It maybe partly my fault by hoping too much before actually reading the book.If you are totally unfamiliar with the field of Physics discussed in the books, which is mostly Relativity and Quantum Physics, this book is a great introductory materials. It also serves as a great prologue to the key question that is bothering Physicist. It is a great formulation of the question.However, I can’t really recommend this book to people who is also a Physicist, or maybe people who is not Physicist but already familiar with Quantum Physics and Relativity. This is because there are nothing new to add...The title of the book is “Now”, the theme described in the prologue is about finding the right definition of “Now”, and somewhere in the middle, it’s just a big historical introduction to explain why the question is not addressed. Throughout the middle, I was waiting for when the key topic is going to be discussed: “What is Now?” “How do we formulate Now?” “What is wrong with current understanding of time?” “What are the possible scientific approach to find the correct definitions?”I was waiting and waiting, patiently, consuming information that I already knew, in the hope that it’s just an exposition to the big reveal. Only to be disappointed because when we actually arrived at the key questions... It was just a questions... and the book ends there... To my surprise, because there are a couple of pages left and it turns out it was just the appendix (which is calculations details and formulas, but I already knew about that. Every graduate students will know about that...)So, again, it’s not a bad book. It’s good for beginners. But it was just a disappointing journey for me personally."
29,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1810641-carole-b,2,"It’s ridiculous to attempt to lay out the conceptualization of time throughout recorded thought, to present a primer on the physics (including but not limited to quantum theory and a large part of Einstein’s career) behind theories of time, and to give an account of the ways one’s thoughts on time evolve throughout a career in physics and relate to personal achievements. But this is what Muller attempts, and though it’s an admirable project, it rather predictably fails in thoroughness.His thinking style is engaging, but his writing does not keep up with his rapid-fire jumps from topic to topic. His summaries of complex quantum theory for pedestrian non-physicist rubes like myself are obviously well-intentioned, but didn’t quite do the trick for me; all the same I appreciated the intention to explain rather than dismiss material as too complex for the common audience. I’d agree with other reviewers that his actual addressing of the topic of “Now,” postponed until the last 6 pages of the book, was inadequate. The most significant part of the book, the idea on which he built his ideas of experiencing “now,” was the work he had done at Berkeley. He observed precisely identical particles behaving differently, and deduced that because statistical and quantum physics cannot predict different behaviors for identical particles, they cannot predict the full future, and free will is therefore possible. His history of the philosophical and scientific analyses of time were interesting, and could have been expanded into an interesting book in their own right. This also would’ve provided a more solid foundation for the last two chapters, which explain his personal views on free will, which seemed a bit out of place after several hundred pages on specific physics theories."
30,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63360490-george-f-greenwald,2,"Lee Smolin was quoted regarding this book, “a provocative, strongly argued book on the fundamental nature of time.” Dr. Smolin was way too kind. Dr. Muller may be a very good physicist, but his book reflects a jumble of thoughts. At times the book presents the accepted theories of relativity and quantum physics, while at other times, the writing appears to be totally out of line with the thoughts of any respected scientist. As an example:Dr. Muller states that the expansion of the universe is merely an expansion of space with no expansion of the galaxies involved. What does he think fills the gaps between the suns and planets in a galaxy (clue: space). Just one of numerous inconsistencies in the book. Worse than that, he makes an incredible jumble of the second law of thermodynamics, specifically entropy. No student in that field could gain an understanding by reading his confused state and jumbled explanation.I was very fortunate to have learned Entropy from Dr. Norbert Wiener's ""Cybernetics and Society: Human Use of Human Beings."" Dr. Muller could use some of his brilliant thinking. Dr. Wiener presented some incredibly innovative ideas about information theory and how entropy plays a role in that field. His books are still in print. Thanks to Dr. Wiener I spent my career in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.As for Dr. Muller's philosophies, I suggest that you read Yuval Harari's books, such as ""Sapiens."" Dr. Muller can't decide whether we, as humans have a soul.I can suggest many other physicists such as Brian Greene's writings. I suggest that you forget this jumble of attempts at factual and inventive ideas."
31,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/710326-shawn,2,"If you've already read much in the areas of relativity, quantum physics, entropy, and related topics, this isn't the book for you. And even if you haven't, I don't think this is a very clear introduction to those topics. The only really interesting thing in the book is his theory that the now is the boundary of expanding time -- the result of the big bang and the expansion of space that has already been proven. He believes that it is space-time that is expanding, creating new time along with new space, and that the typical diagram of space-time, which shows a time line that seems to stretch into the future, with now shown as a dot on that line, is misleading and that there should be nothing on the line beyond the point of now, as anything beyond that has yet to be created. He even offers at least one way in which the theory could possibly be falsified, though perhaps not with current technology.The only really appalling parts of the book are those in which he revives the Cartesian Theater, wanting to know (speaking of how one knows what the color blue looks like) ""how I saw, how the signal went beyond my brain, to that place where I could see what the color of blue looked like."" The little homunculus sitting in his Cartesian Theater he wants to call the soul. And from there it's pretty much downhill, with discussions of the soul, empathy and free will that make no pretense of having any scientific basis.One needn't be a thoroughgoing ""physicalist"" to find this a pretty disappointing book from a prize-winning physicist."
32,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,2,"Almost 3 stars. Only because much of it went way over my head. While the subject of astrophysics and space-time fascinates me, I really need watered down versions of the stuff or at least have it explained to me like I'm a five year old with plenty of drawlings. Plus I needed to see the graphs and figures he was talking about. My copy from Overdrive didn't have any attached documents. They need to work on that. The author talked about White Holes. I guess they are time reversed Black Holes. I had never heard of that before.I just want to know why nothing can go faster than the speed of light. Didn't the Big Bang happen faster than that? Isn't Quantum Physics about going faster than the speed of light and things happening almost in an instant?I liked the author's rant against scientists when they made Pluto not a planet anymore. Why are they to do such a thing? And he said his 7th grade math teacher was the worst.Numbers aren't things but concepts useful for calculating and abstractions used to organize our thoughts. All of mathematics is knowledge outside of physical reality.Your velocity depends on the platform you are using as a reference. Time also has a reference frame. Time stretches and shrinks on physics. We need some nice science explanations to explain why time stands still for kids but for adults it goes by so quickly."
33,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11803119-frederick-gault,4,"In short, Muller argues that Physics, like math, is incomplete. ""Now"" is the wavefront of the expansion of the Universe from the big bang. That is to say as 3D space inflates, so does time, ""now"" is the shockwave front. But Muller is quick to point out there are some troubling aspects. Unlike Einstein, who thought that given enough information the past can be used to predict the future, Muller, and many others, believe that it is impossible to predict the future; look to the fact that we can only statistically know when radioactive decay of a particle will occur. This leads to some interesting conclusions, for example; free will is real - and some questions, such as ""does the color blue look the same to me as it does to you?"" is unanswerable. Muller loses me when he contends that the incompleteness of physics suggests that we have an essence, a soul if you will, that is much like the color blue, unknowable using science, but never the less real."
34,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"Well done. Easy to follow along if you have some science background... meaning... if you watch those science TV shows and find them fascinating. Certainly I do.Any problems? They are minor. The author mocks the Anthropic Cosmological Principle by simplifying it to the point of making it sound foolish. It is not foolish. Hawkings addressed the issue seriously in his book ""A Brief History of Time"". While Hawkings rejected the idea, he treated it seriously which it deserves.Although the author discusses the idea of G-d and religion, he seems ambiguous about it. One can hardly discuss physics in a book for a popular audience without discussing G-d. One either takes a solid opinion one way or the other or ignores the issue entirely. The author seemed to vacillate, and ended up waxing poetic.As I say, these are minor points when weighed against the rest of the book which was informative and easy to understand.I'd read this book again."
35,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"I like how Muller rips the ""map"" from the territory and returns time to temporality instead of using the extended 4D spacial metaphor that Einstein utilized to express relativity. Beyond that, Muller seems to be dated, as the connection between information entropy and energy entropy is being redefined today. For Muller NOW and free will appear to be ill defined in that after he recasts time as time instead of space, and time as time instead of causal entropy, he doesn't seem to have any other answers. He does reinsert NOW back into time, and us back into that.While I was blown away when reading this book, I realized that all Muller does, is to undo the metaphorical rhetoric physicists used to describe their theories and revelations. So that is worth while, but beyond that, I am not sure where we could go from there."
36,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23729147-david-lilly,3,"90% of the book is an overview of modern physics, relativity, and quantum mechanics. This was cool, because I'm still fuzzy on some of the things, though I've gone through books with them in them before. Anyway, after he builds this background he gets to his theory of ""Now"". Essentially, his theory is that just as the Universe is expanding with new space being created, also time is being created. Essentially ""now"" is the leading edge of the time expansion wave. He presented some theories about how this theory could be tested (falsified is how he phrased it), I sort of understood what he was saying but have no idea how one could actually conduct any of the experiments he was describing since they all (traditionally) have required the assumption that time was not the variable being tested."
37,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30207794-jon-stonecash,5,"A wonderfully written book about deep subjects. Muller offers an explanation of time that I found feasible. The author does not prove his case, but that lack of hard physical proof is part of his argument. The explanatory power of physics is powerful but not total. There are things, important and real, that physics cannot address. Just as there are mathematical statements that may be true but cannot be proven with conventional mathematical methods. Muller suggests that our perception of time is one of these true but not fully explainable experiences. The uncertainty principle makes it impossible to fully predict the future and thus gives us free will. I cannot say that I understood everything in the book. I never do with this kind of book. But I understood more at the end of the book than at the beginning, and that is the point. "
38,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38614516-clarissa,4,"Muller’s NOW was engaging. He focused a lot on entropy and dabbled with other ideas from religion and philosophy. Though his arguments in proving the NOW time through the arrow of time, entropy, free will and such - I feel in a nutshell, everything single thing he wrote is really subjective. This is not about passing judgment on his work; I will never be able to understand the complexity of Physics nor am I in any way equipped with the knowledge to disprove the things he wrote... However, you can look at time through the lens of different mediums like religion, philosophy, and science and come to a unique understanding of how it is measured. Overall, this book was very informative and I look forward to reading more from the author."
39,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2608203-bob-martin,4,"This is a terrific book. It's a fairly clear explanation of the developments in modern physics and the nature and roll of time. For the first time I feel I have a handle on relativity and the elasticity of time. Some of the concepts, particularly in discussing quantum mechanics and entanglement, were a bit hard to grasp, but I have a much better sense of what they're about. Muller is a very good writer. At then end he goes on to argue that nothing in physics contradicts free will. He has a great deal of respect for the work of other scientists, even those he disagrees with. It gave me a lot to think about."
40,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47069635-mikel-wisler,5,"Far more than on book on the physics of time, Muller gets into the philosophy of science and offers up a compelling argument, as a physicist, that physics is incomplete and cannot describe the entirety of reality. Muller also takes on the highly technical and daunting task of establishing a theory of now and manages to keep it accessible to the non-math types like me. This is a superb achievement and a powerful reminder that while science has a crucial and indispensable role to play in human social evolution, there are mysteries and realities that extend beyond the domain of empirical science. "
41,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20819209-hannah,4,"Muller's explanation of his theory for a 4D space-time expansion explanation for the meaning of ""now"" was a thrilling end to a fascinating history of the discoveries and experiments that brought together modern physics, cosmology, and quantum mechanics. I'm definitely not a physicist myself but I was able to follow along and understand many of the ideas he was presenting (even if I had to skim over the mathematics a little bit) and I found them utterly intriguing. Hard book to put down for those who want to know more about how time works and to finally get an understanding of relativity.

It was consciousness expanding...spatially and temporally. Other books on physics, relativity, quantum physics, etc. can be a slog to make your way through. ""From Eternity to Here"" by Carroll was much more of a challenge and I had to really work to make my way through it. But ""Now"" was much more enjoyable. I did find the ending a bit weak...I felt it sort of ""Petered out"". But these sorts of books are really striving for a dramatic arc with a climax at the end.This book was well worth the time."

For me, the clarification of entropy and it's dissociation from the concept of time is the most important. The idea that time is being continuously created along with space by the expansion of the universe is fascinating, as is the idea that each unique moment of now that we experience is a brand-new instant of time. Because of these wonderful thoughts, it is not hard to spot the author some points for meandering on about the soul."

61,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95164490-richard-stephenson,5,Great read for those with a small to medium background in math and physicsIt did a good job explaining and reiterating concepts of physics I had heard before but needed explaining in another way to help me get it. 
62,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118346790-aaroh-gokhale,3,"The author did a pretty good job of explaining multiple concepts in physics such as the different models of time, but later on in the book he started talking about his own philosophical beliefs and about spirituality and so forth, which was really unpleasant to read."
63,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51571856-katie-suttles,3,It was decent except for bringing people's souls into it. Not sure what that has to do with time.
64,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8088941-doug-lobdell,4,Really made me think about time. Good physics. Wrote the author.
65,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72045622-allen-wang,3,"The book was a nice cornucopia of various interesting topics in modern physics, but I feel it lacks cohesiveness."
66,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50769498-roberto-hortal,1,"This is not a book about now, time or physics. it seems to start that way, but develops into a religious rant about trying to convince the reader that we have a soul. Waste of time."
67,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32568398-rubens-alonso,4,Besides of strong scientific content there is a bit of unfalsifiable statements that soured my feelings about this book
68,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15959052-sally-daggett,4,"Interesting, but tough read."
69,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57334031-madisen,2,Enojoyable and very interesting to read. Although I might need a small degree in quanyum phsics to really understand it all. 
70,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61970961-ray,4,"Very interesting and a contrary approach to the source of and the direction of time than others, such as Sean Carroll, etc. A bit metaphysical at the end but he's allowed to speculate."
71,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54591649-kamal-wafi,4,Good up until the woolly last few chapters where some highly speculative spiritualism is shoehorned in.
72,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5987902-rafalp,3,Chaotic but informative
73,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99609955-oleksandr-olasiuk,3,Good physics and analysis but terrible finish.
74,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4083050-samuel-lubell,3,"I did not fully understand this book, even with the discussion. But the ideas here were interesting and makes me wish I had studied this area more."
75,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92355637-huw,5,"I absolutely loved this book. So many challenging concepts to digest, this book challenged my thinking"
76,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30715669-alberto-laver-n,4,A learning experience I enjoyed the book but I need to confess that the subject was overwhelming and it was hard to keep up 
77,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771063-steen-ledet,4,Solid and eye opening. 
78,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487616-peter-aronson,4,"For the most part this book was well written, well argued, and convincing, but then the author gets into his personal beliefs, and it ran into the usual problem with beliefs: they are not convincing. You may agree with them, you may disagree with them, but they have no power to convince (and calling them ""observations"" does not make them not be beliefs if they are not rooted in consensual reality). Also, if you're going to discuss philosophy, to some extent you need to use the language of philosophy as the philosophers have gotten there first and have examined the issue in excruciating detail.Muller's theory of time and its flow is refreshing, plausible, and best of all, makes testable predictions. This is much more elegant than the view held by many physicists that the flow of time is an illusion -- a view that raises as many questions as it avoids in my opinion. I recommend reading the appendixes too (skipping any too mathematical for you). This book makes an interesting companion to Lee Smolin's Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe."
79,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54185-liz-busby,2,"This was an okay science book, but not great. It's really difficult to write about quantum mechanics in a way the layperson can understand. The book admits at several points that many professors have a hard time expressing it to students. I have half a bachelor's in chemistry, and a full degree in English, and I found this difficult to understand both in terms of science and writing. The beginning was clearly directed at the public, but it felt like it eventually devolved into a list of impenetrable citations and jargon. And then there was that random half-baked chapter critiquing the Enlightenment? In the end, I wasn't sure what point he was trying to make or if he proved it. Just not a good enough writer to pull it off, I think. It had some memorable moments, but overall, tough haul."
80,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5970140-eric-carlson,5,"This is the best book I have read in a long time. Lucid, insightful, and circumspect."
81,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42346884-pietro-condello,5,"An excellent book by a respected quantum physicist that tackles the question of what exactly is the phenomenon that we experience as time. We can move back in forth in the 3 spatial dimensions freely, what makes the 4th so different? How do you define what ""now"" means, and is now the exact same moment in all places? What is the mechanism that dictates time must flow in one direction only? For decades, physicists agreed that the only law whose equations specifically require an arrow of time is the second law of thermodynamics - that entropy always tends to increase over time - that the universe tends to move from order to disorder - that broken teacups never tend to jump back onto tables and reassemble themselves. Run the movie backwards, so to speak, and no other physical laws are broken. That explanation proved for a very long time to be the most reasonable explanation for the arrow of time, and Muller systematically and brilliantly dismantles it, piece by piece. Quantum physics has proven that reality is in fact much stranger still than as described by time dilation and length contraction by relativity. "
82,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43914316-mark,4,"This was an impulse read as I saw it walking into the library. Really enjoyed it. It stretched my brain just enough and didn't bog down in the math. Really good high-level overview of relativity and quantum theory and the author's theory of ""now"" is thought-provoking. I liked it most because it deepened my sense of awe of God."
83,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56987369-eric,5,"Started reading this, the beginning is great for a layman like myself who needs a physics refresher."
84,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"I rate this three stars because I genuinely enjoyed the fresh ways of looking at entropy, time's arrow, and the concept of free will and what an experimental physicist can contribute to those topics and how they intersect. However once he steps out of his element, Muller quickly goes off the rails with ridiculous discussions of so-called ""physicalism,"" religion, leading to such absurd remarks like: ""The US voter does not want to elect a sociopath. Yet sociopaths can be very successful leaders, as evidenced by Mao, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein."" Not only is there no context for that remark in the book, but it might help to define success before you make such a careless statement as that, and there are many others. As a few have already pointed out, ""Now: The Physics of Time,"" is not an appropriate title for this work as most of the discussion rests on the idea of free will and the influence of the physics of time on that concept. Interesting reading in the early going, bizarre and disjunct philosophical meanderings at the end of the book. Partial recommendation."
85,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323455-jeremy,4,"This book exhibits many of the strengths Muller displayed in his previous book, Physics for Future Presidents: a grounding in the realities of experiment and observation, using order-of-magnitude estimates and some straightforward simplified math to help the reader to gain a better understanding of the physics, etc. The counterpart that he offers to the viewpoint of physicists like Sean Carroll (particularly in books like From Eternity to Here) is clear and easy to follow, in contrast to the much more obscure Time Reborn by Lee Smolin.This book gives a lot of food for thought on the question of why we experience a ""now"" in time, though certainly it does not settle the question. It is hard as a no specialist to evaluate just how good his arguments are, but it certainly helps to clarify the questions. The one part of the book I could have done without was Part IV: Physics and Reality, which digresses into issues of free will, identity, et cetera, which are handled pretty shallowly and not particularly pertinent to the argument."
86,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52816046-lynn-romine,5,A great workThis book is great because it makes you think. It makes you realize that there are more questions than answers to time.
87,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17431775-schwarzenberger,2,"To define this very moment, to put your finger on the very pulse of time, to feel the space between heartbeats and the pause between inhale and exhale is a formidable task whether you are a philosopher, poet or even a physicist.Living in these moments of perpetual present as we all do I really wanted to be excited and have my curiosity about these ever present phenomena--maybe ""now"" should be described as a plural--discussed in a book that would give at least some light on the matter. After picking away at it piecemeal for some weeks the same frustrated feeling that I had about trying to discuss what ""now"" is at various late night college bull sessions in my far distant past is still with me. I wanted to be more stimulated and illuminated by what was promised to be explained by this title.Muller does excite my imagination at times relating his various personal experiences about dealing with postdocs and the highs and lows of experimental research in the field of physics both in the visible world and the crazy quantum dimension that we as humans cannot sensually experience.The book has a lot of those incidental facts such as the misspelling of the word gogol (A number named by a nine year old, it is 1 followed by a hundred zeros.) by the company Google that is now in everyone's common experience. All these concepts of science and philosophy and even religion together are interesting just like a great rambling cocktail party conversation that may introduce new found friends to each other.The author ranges far and wide and goes all the way back to the beginnings of what George Gamow described as ""the thirty years that shook physics"" as the world was introduced to quantum and atomic science. I did like how he (or maybe the editor) picked out various cartoons to help illustrate various points--the New Yorker cartoon of Mr Schrödinger at vets waiting for news of his cat got a very loud laugh from me--""...about your cat...I have good and bad news.""Unfortunately, I have give it only 2 stars. I really wanted it to be more satisfying because the subject is fascinating to me but the aggregate of this book does not fully satisfy. I don't want to sound nasty but I am glad that this book of ""Now"" in my past.I did receive this book as a Goodreads Giveaway. The publisher did send me a soft bound advance uncorrected proof that proved frustrating because the pages were numbered but not the table of contents. Even more frustrating there was no index and this kind of book needs an index to get you to the various subjects, characters and concepts right away."
88,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46411315-joe-forgione,5,"Excellent book. Makes you think about not only the physics of time, but also the philosophical and spiritual aspects of it. "
89,0393285235,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16201195-hua-wang,4,"It is more than a book about just talking about time. It is a combination of relativity, quantum physics, big bang, unification theory, and philosophy. It is worth reading."
