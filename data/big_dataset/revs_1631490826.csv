0,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"38th book for 2016. The idea behind this book, that 50% of the World should be put aside as a wildness (half for us, half for the rest), is a big idea very well worth exploring. Unfortunately, this book does no justice to the idea. It rambles along. Talks a lot about the beauty of the natural world, of the joys of being a naturalist, rants against the stupidity of people who somehow see value in half-wild places, and finally in this short book pays a scant few pages to vaguely outlining the idea of putting aside 50% of the World to wilderness. The book ends with random thoughts about robotics, whole-brain-emulation (!), and how free markets will naturally evolve to be eco-friendly so no need to worry about climate change (!!!!). It's a real shame, as the idea behind the book is great and audacious, and someone of the stature of Wilson is needed to really push it forward. What a wasted opportunity."

Wilson gives a well-researched, well-documented, eloquent, but above all, impassioned plea on behalf of our planet and all of those who call it home, human and non-human alike. Species are dying out at an alarming rate and it is Wilson’s contention that “only by setting aside half the planet in reserve, or more, can we save the living part of the environment and achieve the stabilization required for our own survival”.Wilson points out that thanks to our behaviour in just the last two centuries, we are now approaching the Anthropocene, a period created by us at the expense of other species. He gives some very interesting counterpoints to those who would argue that this Anthropocene Epoch is now inevitable; that it is really too late to stop the march to extinction completely and we should put all our energy and resources to saving those species who are most useful to us, that in the end the system will right itself. But, as Wilson shows, nature is a complex system in which species depend on each other for survival. To allow the end of even the tiniest mollusk for example can lead and likely will to the end of species that were dependent on it for sustenance starting a chain of extinctions eventually leading to us. Wilson has a more appropriate albeit emotional name for this period, the Eremocene or the Age of Loneliness.Clearly, Wilson believes that it is time that we stopped seeing ourselves as rulers of the planet and became instead better stewards. He shows clearly and concisely how overpopulation and growing lack of arable land and water rather than religion or historical injustice are driving many of the problems we are facing today in eg the Middle East and, if nothing is done and soon, these problems will only get worse. This book was both fascinating and eye-opening for me. I found the science enlightening and Wilson’s obvious love and wonderment at the beauty and complexity of nature moving. It was only at the end that the book shows weaknesses. When it comes to the question of how these half-earth reserves are to be achieved, he points to technology but he never really addresses how, in this age of perpetual growth, Anthropocene worldview, and climate change denial, the resolve to make the sacrifices that will be necessary can be achieved. Still, he makes it clear that, if we wish to continue on this planet, we must find ways to do so. As he points out in his final sentence: “It is simple and easy to say: Do no further harm to the planet. “"
2,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"Species are going extinct about 1000 times as fast as the “normal” rate of extinction. The solution, argues the author, is to give over half of the earth to the wild animals. I am a nonspecialist, and in addition to Wilson’s book and miscellaneous other articles, I’ve already read Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History as well as Anthony Barnosky’s Dodging Extinction: Power, Food, Money, and the Future of Life on Earth. The strong point of Wilson’s book is that he understands the complexity of nature on earth, and he brings some new information to the table. And for someone who is new to this issue, this book would explain quite a bit about the complexity of life on earth. If you are thinking, “hey, maybe this whole extinction crisis thing is overblown,” and you are not already familiar with e. g. Kolbert’s or Barnosky’s book, well, this book is for you. The weak point, and it is unfortunately a significant problem, is that he never really delivers on his promise of a specific plan, despite the title. Basically what should have been the outcome of Wilson’s book — a concrete plan to deal with biodiversity — doesn’t really happen, and now we, the nonspecialists, are left looking elsewhere and scrambling to answer some significant questions. The most significant questions are: “just where is this half of the earth that you propose returning to wilderness? And wouldn’t your proposal necessitate ending livestock agriculture?”And here’s the bottom line: Anthony Barnosky has written a better book, but Wilson’s book is also valuable and has some material that Barnosky does not, so anyone wanting to know more should read both of them. Kolbert is a great writer, so if you know nothing about any of this and want an entertaining read that will convince you that the extinction crisis is real, read Kolbert. Kolbert doesn’t really offer any specifics on what to do, other than to blame humans for the problem. For specifics, we go to Wilson and to Barnosky. That’s my review. Here are some details, divided into two sections: some new things I got from the book, and some problems that I had with the book. To begin with, here are some new things. These are points that I didn’t get (or didn’t get clearly) from Kolbert or Barnosky. There are people who know how to restore ecosystems, at least to the point of European contact. For example, there are people trying to restore the longleaf pine savannah of the deep South. I had heard of the longleaf pine, but had no idea that this was the key part of a distinct ecosystem. Now I know that this ecosystem is pretty much gone — not just the pine itself, but the ecosystem in which it was dominant — but people are going through and in places restoring it. So we get the impression that when Wilson says that we could restore biodiversity if we really wanted to, he knows what he’s talking about.But there also are actually people out there who are arguing for less biodiversity. Their argument is, roughly, that there is no point in trying to preserve the pre-human ecological habitats, that the old ecosystems are pretty much broken already, and that we are entering a new era, the Anthropocene, and we should try to make the best of it. I could scarcely believe it. And this apparently includes The Nature Conservancy! I knew that perhaps some people might be decreasing biodiversity by accident, or not fully appreciating the reality of the situation, but some people are actually trying to promote this as desirable. What! This is an outrage. These people are the enemy not just of us, but of all life on earth.Another critical and interesting point is that there is a way of quantifying species loss via habitat loss. It is that the species that can survive are the fourth root of the habitat still available. Wilson refers to this rule on several occasions. He gives, as an example, that if 90% of the habitat is destroyed, that about half of the total number of species can survive there. It’s fairly remarkable, because it implies that we know a lot more about species extinction than I thought we did. It’s not at all subjective and qualitative, or not in the way that we imagine. This point could have been explained in more detail. I actually had to “do the math” before I understood what was being said, which I will now do. You’ve heard of square roots and cube roots? Well, this is the fourth root. If Y (species that can survive) = the fourth root of X (habitat still available), then Y * Y * Y * Y = X. So if 10% of the habitat remains (0.1), then the fourth root is 0.56, or roughly half of the species. If 50% of the habitat remains, then about 85% of the species could survive. The habitat decreases a lot faster than the number of species does.Got that? Of course, that’s just the number of species, not the total number of living organisms, which will decrease roughly in proportion with the habitat remaining.And now for the more problematic parts. First of all, the book takes too long to get to the “solution.” We are through 80% of the book before we even get to Part 3, “The Solution.” What’s more, the solution’s details are quite problematic and only sketchily outlined. The book made me think, “Oh God, we’ve got a serious problem fighting for biodiversity,” and looking for other books that might supplement Wilson’s point of view, because the details are totally missing, and it sounds like Wilson is completely oblivious to just how badly he’s missed the boat.How are we going to get half of the earth for the wild animals and plants? I kept expecting him to say something about “limits to growth,” or make a passing reference to livestock agriculture, or refer to the fact that 90% of the biomass of megafauna is now humans, their livestock, and their pets. Nope, nothing like that. Wilson seems to think that the economy will get bigger and better in every way into the indefinite future, through the miracle of the free enterprise system (chapter 20, “Threading the Bottleneck”). The products that will win out will be those that are the least expensive to manufacture. (He assumes, I think, that this also means “least resource intensive” — big mistake.) Current human population is also not a problem. Agriculture is scarcely even mentioned. He spends just a few pages on this whole subject. Interestingly, the bibliography has some references to the “end of economic growth,” but none of that has crept into the text. Well, here’s the deal. There is NO WAY you are going to get to “half earth” unless you pretty much ditch livestock agriculture. That’s because livestock agriculture is the leading human use of land and it’s occupying about 1/3 of the earth’s land surface — and some of the most biologically productive areas, also. That’s why over 90% of the large animal biomass on land is humans, their livestock, and their pets. And what about resource shortages, peak oil, deforestation, groundwater mining, and soil erosion? Couldn’t this throw a monkey wrench into the works? Do you think?Where, exactly, is this half of the earth now dedicated to wilderness? To his credit, Wilson does itemize some ecosystems of the world that deserve to be preserved, in chapter 15, “The best places in the biosphere.” So we have a start, but we do not have a follow-through. This is what we need for Wilson’s plan to be viable. I want to see a map of the world. I want to see areas mapped out in at least some moderate detail, divided between “wild” and “human-dominated.” I want to see half of it marked “wild.” All right? Further, I don’t expect the “wild part” to be just the Sahara Desert, Antarctica, Greenland, and Siberia. I expect the wild parts to be just as biologically productive as the human parts. I expect the large-animal biomass of the “wild” area roughly to equal the large-animal biomass of the “human dominated” area. If you do this honestly, you are going to eliminate all livestock agriculture AND reduce human population from its current bloated status. Again: do the math.Also, what about the oceans? Is “half earth” just half of the land area, or are we going to deal with the oceans also?Wilson should know that natural resources are cheap and THAT’S why we’re pillaging the earth. Fossil fuels are extraordinarily cheap compared to (say) human labor, or even animal labor. And as long as fossil fuels are cheap, minerals are cheap, transportation is cheap, and we have a climate change problem. Yes, technology might come to the rescue, but it can’t be a huge complicated flow chart with the final box reading “then a miracle occurs.” I wish that Wilson would assume currently available technology, and show how we would rope off half the earth for wilderness with that. If we do wind up with some fancy-dancy technology, then we can apply it to the situation. I appreciate the bold proposal in “Half-Earth.” I wish that he had talked some more — a lot more — on the topic proposed in his title, instead of talking around the issue. Anthony Barnosky is more on point here; he is clear that we’re going to be eating a lot less meat. So if you want the bold proposal, read ""Half-Earth."" If you want to know how to implement the bold proposal, read Barnosky’s book, ""Dodging Extinction."" "

Conclusion: humans are stupid and heartless"
4,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward,3,"Wilson argues that humanity's only chance for survival as a species is to cooperate with other life forms that make up the biodiversity of the earth. At the rate we're going, our destruction of the environment, in terms of global-warming, is having a disastrous effect on the millions of other life forms on this planet, most of them as yet undiscovered by humans. The long term effects of such destruction means the extinction of humanity. Many species have appeared and disappeared in the history of the planet, the most notable mammalian example being the dinosaurs, so there is no reason to assume that humans can necessarily avoid this fate. Still, we can try, and Wilson's proposal is that approximately half of the earth should be left in its natural state, protected from human interference, and in this way humans would do minimal harm to the planet. The natural areas would be widespread, so the proposal is not as drastic as it at first sounds, and a hopeful note is that most countries already have protected natural territories. But much more needs to be done. Wilson emphasizes that the biosphere was not intended to be ruled by humans; it does not belong to us, we belong to it.  He takes a very dim view of technology being able to solve the problems of humans existing in a diminished biosphere. This view contends that a good part of the biosphere is already ruined and is beyond repair. No matter, we'll just figure out technological ways to solve our problems, whether it be climate change, food production, species extinction. A much too simplistic approach that doesn't take into account the complexities of the interrelationship of all living things on our planet. Two thirds of all the species on Earth are unknown, and less than one in a thousand have been biologically researched. To wade into this intricacy with crude technological solutions would be the height of folly and would have far-reaching unintended consequences.  Wilson asks where do we think we are going? ""I think the great majority of people on earth would agree with the following goals: a long and healthy life for all, abundant sustainable resources, personal freedom, adventure both virtual and real on demand, status, dignity, membership in respectable groups, obedience to wise rulers and laws, and lots of sex with or without reproduction."" The problem is, though, Wilson writes, that these are also the goals of your family dog. The dog is on automatic pilot, assuming that these things will fill his life, and if we don't rise above this animal level and give serious thought as to how to bring them about, then we are doomed. A worthwhile set of proposals, but the problem may be a political will to achieve them. Most people only pay attention to these basically environmental concerns when they begin to notice disastrous consequences (for example, flooding, violent storms, food shortages, for starters) and then it is too late to integrate humanity into the biosphere, and we'll turn to the kind of clumsy and ultimately destructive technological approaches that Wilson deplores. "
5,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392395-ash,4,"Half-Earth is half distressing biology news, half Edward O. Wilson's love letter to species that are largely ignored by popular conservation because they aren't cute enough. Wilson is a natural biologist who studies ants, and his passion - especially for ants, particularly for bugs, and generally for any living creature - shines through every page of this book. I am a typical city dwelling nerd who hates little crawly things with too many legs, so it's completely foreign for me to imagine a teenage Wilson becoming so enthralled by trail of ants that he literally dedicated his life to them, but Wilson knows his interests are fringe even among the conservation minded so as much as he strays into ant-facts, he always manages to rope bug-haters like me back into the fold. I don't have much of a science background, but Wilson largely did a good job explaining the concepts behind his theories. There were times when he ventured into ideas with a more mathematical basis (things like the percentage of biodiversity lost as related to the percentage of an environment that's been removed) that completely lost me because my math is not up to par; I would have gotten more out of this, I think, if I had a more throrough knowledge of geography and the different types of environments. Like: I get what a forest is; I do not have a specific image of an alpine forest. These are really my own failings that could have been fixed by using Google more while I was reading. He also lost me a bit talking about the differences between varieties of biologists. Anyway,the point is that even skimming over some of the specifics, I have a good understanding of the point Wilson set out to make. And to be fair, that is because this book is very repetitive. It's divided into three sections, and I think I might have been better off reading the chapters from sections one and two as separate essays - a chapter every day or two, taken as a standalone. Insted I read this straight through which just highlighted the repetition; I don't think it was necessary for the reading experience (I do think that the final section should be read in one go; the previous chapters are about specific places and environments and what has been done to them, while the third focuses more on solutions/the future). On the other hand, I can't fault him too much for repetition; this man has probably spent a good majority of his life telling people that they're fucking everything up and need to stop, and so far they have not listened. He may as well repeat it several times per chapter, since clearly humanity at large is selectively choosing not to hear it. The standout chapters for me were the ones that dealt with marine life / the ocean, but that's just my own preferences shining through, and the chapter where he polled other biologists about the places that they thought were very special and should be saved at all costs. And I did enjoy the third section, where he talks more about both his half-earth solution and about how better technology can improve both human life and conservation. He's also a big proponent of creating live feeds out of nature reserves which people can watch on the internet FROM HOME; I don't know why that's so surprising to me, since it makes sense that tourists shouldn't be tramping around in nature reserves, but it's nice to read something conservation themed that also celebrates technology and supports my desire to look at cute animals on the internet all day.Anyway: I enjoyed this and although I feel like Wilson is screaming into the void a little bit, I do wish that more people would listen to what he has to say. This is so important."

7,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"I hate to give E.O. Wilson anything less than 5 stars. However, his writing has really gone downhill, which makes me truly sad. The first book in this trilogy, Social Conquest of Earth, was great until the last chapter. He kept politics out of the whole book and then went on a rant about his political views. I actually agreed with those views but it was off-putting even to me. The rant came out of nowhere. If he had sprinkled his views throughout the book, as if they were not something he was trying to hide, it would not have felt to the reader like they were getting hit by a truck of political beliefs at the end of what was a truly fantastic book. The second book, Meaning of Life, showed that Wilson still excelled in gathering data and updating his views, but that it was a little more difficult for him to convey those views to a general audience. There was a marked difference in his writing from Book One to Book Two of the trilogy. This last book showed an even steeper decline in writing. Maybe it's just that he was too busy to write all three? This is a shame because the deck is already stacked against Wilson, who is a brilliant scientist with important things to say. For example, with comments like, 'Just throw out Wilson's book. Don't even read it!,"" Dawkins has been on a campaign to destroy Wilson for years. This is infuriating, since Wilson has updated his understanding of science over the years, while Dawkins has treated science like a religion, refusing to accept any changes since the 1970s, despite the overwhelming evidence presented to him (e.g. epigenetics). However, even though Wilson's critical thinking and scientific investigation is holding up, his writing is not. This book tries to do great and worthwhile things, but it is a chore to read. It would probably be a very good idea for Wilson to collaborate on future books with a younger colleague who excels at writing for the general public. That was his ideas can still make their way to the public but they will be better organized and far more enjoyable to read. This a 2 star book, but can't bring myself to give it less than 3. "
8,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"This book is a terrific journey through the incredible biodiversity of our planet. Or at least what remains of our biodiversity. In this Anthropocene Age we live in, humans have sacrificed the earth's species on the altar of ""economic development"" and ""freedom"" and ""the accumulation of material wealth."" The result is a blind trip toward oblivion. But for a few brief hours, I could enjoy the world's species and wild areas vicariously through the writing of Edward O. Wilson. There are solutions presented here. The half-earth proposal means setting aside half the planet's land and seas in order to halt the accelerating extinction of biodiversity. When I realize that American voters actually went in to a private voting booth and clicked off the name Donald Trump, and many of those voters are still enabling him, and the organizations and individuals who supported him are still going strong with their supporters, I am not optimistic in the least.

Wilson's comically unfeasible plan is to give over half the planet to wildlife. Given the inability of the world's governments to agree on even the mildest steps to protect the environment, you can safely ignore this pompous, rambling book, whose Pulitzer seems a perfect example of futile virtue signalling."
10,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7257488-fred-rose,2,"E.O. Wilson is a great scientist and writer but this is not a very good book. He doesn't even get to his proposal (if you can call it that) for setting aside wildlife areas until 3/4 of the way through the book and it's so vague, it's hard to call it a plan, more of a plea. It's important stuff, no doubt, the more written about the 6th extinction, the better. It's as big a deal as climate change."
11,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2300344-greg,1,"This book is a mess. The first part of the title, Half-Earth, refers to the supposed main argument that humankind must preserve the Earth's biodiversity by leaving half of the Earth as untouched wilderness (or maybe managed wilderness) in order to ensure humankind's survival. Amazingly, the author spends only a few pages unconvincingly discussing this idea. Instead of discussing the central argument, the book spends a surprising number of pages discussing things like artificial intelligence, the joys of being a naturalist scientist, and a survey of fellow scientists' favorite pockets of biodiversity across the world. It's generally an unfocused discussion of any topic remotely related to biodiversity.On a positive note, the book spends some time discussing the need to defend local ecosystems by defending biodiversity within them. This is an important issue that I agree with. Unfortunately, the arguments aren't very convincing, and they are unlikely to convince people who don't already agree. They basically boil down to the argument that allowing ecosystems to destabilize is playing a game of Russian roulette with the natural world and its ability to support humankind. I'm surprised that a leading scientist in this field can't make stronger arguments based on specific risks."

14,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"Wilson is a scientist and a long-time ardent proponent of saving our planet. He has deep concerns for our biosphere and advocates setting aside half the earth for the natural world. Wilson lays down solid evidence for his worries, and I came away from the book nodding my head in agreement.My takeaways from Half-Earth:Many scientists believe man has had such a profound impact on the planet that we should acknowledge the end of the Holocene Epoch and replace it with the Anthropocene, the Epoch of Man. Apocalyptic extinctions are rare in the history of life, occurring only at about hundred-million year intervals. The planet usually required ten million years to recover from each. Our current peak of destruction initiated by humanity is often called the Sixth Extinction.A census of biodiversity is currently in the process of being taken. It is believed that the total will be much higher than the two million species so far discovered.Nothing causes the destruction of a biosphere as invasive species. It is generally believed that before the coming of humanity about two hundred thousand years ago, the rate of origin of new species per extinction of exiting species was about one species per million species per year. But, due to human activity, it is believed that currently the rate of extension overall is between a hundred and a thousand times higher than it originally was. The rate of extinction is rising in most parts of the world, with the preeminent sites of biodiversity loss being the tropical forests and coral reefs. If ninety percent of a forest is cut, about half of the species will soon disappear. Hawaii has been universally acknowledged as the extinction capital of the world.Scientists use the acronym HIPPO for a quick list of our most ruinous activities: Habitat destruction, invasive species, pollution, population growth, and overhunting.Most experts agree that humanity has raised the concentration of greenhouse gasses, especially carbon dioxide and methane, to a dangerous level. Predictions for the future are generally agreed upon: historic heat records will become routine; severe storms and weather anomalies will be normal; the melting of the ice shields will accelerate; the sea levels will rise exponentially.There are those who are considered Anthropocene optimists, who feel a human-centered world is a good thing and a desirable outcome. A lot to think about."

It is an excellent read, that presented both local and global perspectives on ecological issues. However, I did find that his grand statements about conservation didn’t actually provide a comprehensive plan. This book mostly offered interesting scientific facts, which isn’t a bad thing, but a bit more specificity towards his conservation strategy would’ve been nice."
16,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,2,"This book is half terrifying and half tedious. Raising the alarm over the coming crash of biodiversity is all well and good, but when you sound like Ben Stein from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (“Something-dee-oh-oh economics. Voodoo economics.” https://youtu.be/AyyAh2lQXF8), it kind of undercuts the urgency. It doesn’t help that the text is completely unfocused and he wanders far off topic, even to the point of giving lists of various things repeatedly.Worst of all, he never really explicitly states his solution beyond a vague idea about setting aside half the Earth as wild areas — essentially national parks — to preserve ecosystems and promote the necessary biodiversity.Wilson wrote this in 2015, toward the end of Obama’s presidency, and seems to fall into the intellectual trap of believing that reasonable people will realize the issue at stake and therefore — obviously! — take steps to confront global warming. This is a weird thing that many ivory tower types do, and of all people I expected Wilson to at least recognize the real-world issues conservationists and other scientists face. Yet he seems blind to the reality that the super-rich conservatives are bound and determined to pave over the planet in pursuit of squeezing the very last penny out of it before it dies. Surely Wilson paid attention to the Bush Jr. presidency, which was not just actively but aggressively anti-science. The W administration rewrote scientific papers to remove discussions of global warming. They not only fired but prosecuted scientists who researched climate change. Did he not see how pervasive that sentiment is?I can forgive Wilson for not thinking in 2015 that Trump was going to be a credible candidate, nevermind become President. I thought the same thing right up until the 2016 election. And although technically I was correct — Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million — here we are. Trump hates Obama and has done everything he can over the last two years to erase Obama’s legacy. Aided by the extremist Republican Party controlling all of Congress and the Supreme Court, his anti-science, pro-business stance has been supercharged. The GOP on a state level had already done things like disallow the use of the phrases “global warming” and “climate change”, as in Florida, and in North Carolina legislated that scientists could not use modern models to determine coastal erosion and wetlands endangerment but rather had to use pre-World War I measurements. That was all just an outgrowth of Bush’s policies, which aggressively altered scientific reports to eliminate any mention of climate change, and even prosecuted the federal scientists who were researching it.In the face of that, it’s clear that the few things Obama did to preserve the ecosystem were aberrations compared to business as usual in America. The US isn’t the only country, but we have an outsized presence. As the saying goes: when America sneezes, the world catches a cold.I was also baffled that Wilson didn’t address agriculture, specifically animal farming. We already devote fully 1/3 of our arable land to feed and house livestock. We aren’t going to simply give up our bacon cheeseburgers and chicken nuggets to build parks, and any proposal that doesn’t tackle that issue is doomed.When Wilson also said towards the end that business would find a solution, he struck me as hopelessly naive. There’s no inherent drive in capitalism towards preservation. It focuses on short-term profits, not long-term sustainability. Tomorrow’s problems belong to tomorrow’s boardroom. The entire system is geared that way.I also have The Sixth Extinction in my TBR pile, so hopefully that one is better."
17,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"An Impassioned Plea to Preserve Earth's Biodiversity from the Greatest Evolutionary Ecologist of Our TimeNoted evolutionary biologist Edward O. Wilson has written a polemic, but a polemic based on his life-long work in ant systematics and evolutionary ecology, that offers some glimmer of hope. This is a surprisingly terse book from Wilson, but one of sufficient length that it may serve as a rallying call to anyone who has some interest in conservation biology - which he should be viewed as its ""godfather"" - and a keen desire to preserve much of Earth's biodiversity for future generations of humanity. Divided into three sections, Wilson seeks to enlighten the reader on the nature of the problem, how this relates to Earth's current biodiversity, and then, a general overview on what should be done to preserve Earth's biodiversity. In the first section ""Part I: The Problem"", Wilson describes how and why current biodiversity losses should be seen as a ""Sixth Extinction"", equivalent in its severity with the five major mass extinctions known from the Phanerozoic Eon (approximately the last 543 million years of Earth's history). Those familiar with Elizabeth Kolbert's ""The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural Hisotry"" might regard Wilson's descriptive prose, repetitive, in its bleak picture of current biodiversity loss, but it is a picture well-informed by Wilson's own decades-long research in conservation biology and systematic zoology, especially of ants. In ""Part II: The Real Living World"", Wilson's enthusiastic eloquence is at its finest, as he describes vividly, ecosystems in the deepest parts of the world's oceans and even in the Earth's crust that are largely unknown to all, but the most informed readers familiar with relevant aspects of ecology, molecular biology and geology. He also identifies major ecological habitats on Earth that he regards as reclaimable, ranging from the Californian Redwood Forest to the Amazon River Basin, the flatlands of Northeastern Europe and the Congo Basin, to name but a few. In ""Part III: The Solution"" Wilson advocates for his ""Half-Earth"" biodiversity preservation plan, but it is a plan that may seem to many, an impassioned plea, instead of an extensive plan designed to preserve Earth's biodiversity in more or less its current form for centuries. He does note the ongoing digital revolution as a means of not only cataloging all of Earth's biodiversity but in providing us a future in which human civilization's ""ecological footprint"" will be greatly diminished via the development of new technologies that will not only stem the rapid declines in biodiversity loss but also antrhropogenic global warming. With ""Half-Earth: Our Planet's Fight for Life"", Edward O. Wilson may have written his valedictory address to the public in the hope of fostering greater public understanding and interest in the science behind studying and halting Earth's biodiversity loss. A valedictory address that should be read by a wide audience, not only here in the United States but also elsewhere around the globe, noteworthy for Wilson's superb prose and storytelling talent."
18,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"This important and impassioned book by one of the great botanist-naturalist writers of our time is a stirring account of humanity’s impact on planet Earth. If we view humans as simply one of the millions of species that call Earth home, then mankind has negatively impacted earthly environments more than any other living species. Two important words the reader will learn from this book are biosphere (all the organisms alive in the world at any moment, which together form a thin spherical layer around the planet) and biodiversity (the total variation in organisms, past and present, up to and including the entire planet, when viewed as ecosystems, species comprising the ecosystems, and genes prescribing the traits of species).Wilson structures his short book into three sections. In section 1, “The Problem,” he describes only a fraction of the myriad species that occupy the earth, namely, vertebrate animals and flowering plants, and how their accelerating extinction is driven almost entirely by human activity. Wilson points out, by the way, that this is the human impact on known species. Scientific estimates state that there are several million as-yet unknown species, and we have no idea of the damage being done to them. In “The Real Living World,” Wilson points out the inadequacy of current conservation efforts and, indeed, the misguided philosophies on which they are based. He also begins to lay the foundation of his half-earth solution by surveying world-renown experts in biodiversity and ecosystems on the best existing reserves sheltering species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Finally, in “The Solution,” Wilson eloquently lays out his bold and imaginative half-earth proposal to raise conservation efforts to a new level. Simply put, half-earth proposes that ""half the area of Earth’s land and half the area of its seas are set aside to halt the accelerating extinction of biodiversity."" Desperate times call for desperate measures, and Wilson argues that the problem we face cannot be solved in a piecemeal or fragmented way.The first part of this book is somber and compelling; its urgent message hints at the death knell of biodiversity, and the image of Earth as a “planetary spaceship” of wall-to-wall people with no other species. However, the latter part is one of optimistic possibilities. A key element of Wilson’s half-earth solution derives from the “bnr” industries—biology, nanotechnology, and robotics—which will favor biodiversity and make it possible for the estimated ten billion people at the end of this century to live happily, while reducing humanity’s ecological footprint as well as its demands from Earth’s resources.Half-Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life completes a trilogy: the first two books in the series are The Social Conquest of Earth and The Meaning of Human Existence, both equally thought-provoking reads. I only have one argument with this current work: Wilson’s half-earth solution to halt the accelerating extinction of biodiversity is too vital, too critical to be a mere “proposal.” I believe it is compelling enough to be a human imperative!"
19,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,3,"Half-Earth is Edward O. Wilson’s visionary conclusion to the trilogy he began in The Social Conquest of Earth and continued in The Meaning of Human Existence. In the first book, Wilson described his theory of human evolution (based on group rather than kin selection) and how it led to our domination of the biosphere. The Meaning of Human Existence presented a series of essays exploring more philosophically the question of why humans exist at all and whether we have a special destiny. In Half-Earth Wilson addresses one consequence of the sovereignty of humanity on our planet: our responsibility to be stewards of the earth and its biodiversity, a responsibility that we have too long ignored. The first part of the book describes the importance of biodiversity and how extinction is accelerating due to man’s intrusions during the current “Anthropocene” epoch. The second part surveys the panorama of our living world, be it on the ground, beneath the sea, or too small to be seen. This section includes a (personal and subjective) list of the “best places in the biosphere” and describes in beautiful detail why we should want to save them. The list includes some well-known and unsurprising choices like California’s redwood forests but also lesser known areas like the Bialowieza Forest in Poland and Belarus, which contains, among other life forms, European bison and some of the largest oaks ever recorded.The solution Wilson proposes in the last part of the book is straightforward: set aside half the surface of the earth into an inviolable natural reserve. This should protect at least 85 percent of species, more if the protected areas include the “hot spots” where the largest number of endangered species exist. This half-earth figure was not arbitrary but is based on a mathematical relation between habitat area and number of species that Wilson says is broadly accepted in the field of conservation biology. To me this was perhaps the most disappointing part of the book,though, because most readers will not be familiar with this relation. I wanted to know more about it and how it was determined, since it is interesting in itself and also is the basis for Wilson’s half-earth proposal. He goes on to describe the kinds of actions needed to reduce our ecological footprint and make it possible to preserve the half-earth. This is a fascinating book full of scientific lore, history, and Wilson’s accounts of his own experiences in the field and is worth reading on that basis alone. More importantly, the diversity of life he portrays also serves as an inspiration to heed his call to arms: Do no further harm to the biosphere.NOTE: I received an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
20,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10968957-david-anto,2,"I very much wanted to love this book and ended up being very disappointed. 2 stars are perhaps too harsh but I really cannot find many good things about the book. Perhaps besides a few sentences from the last 20 pages.E. O. Wilson's grand suggestion is that we must set aside roughly 50% of Earth's land as wilderness. Unfortunately, instead of starting with this premise and exploring how it can be achieved and what it would bring he never gets much beyond this vague statement. Which he even admits to be a catchy political tagline rather than a serious proposal.Instead, the book contains loosely connected personal thoughts and memories and seemingly randomly selected natural facts that more often than not seem disconnected with the book's main idea. He also seems to be settling accounts with scientific opponents and he engages in some self-pity over the decline of his field of biology (superseded by microbiology etc).I don't have major interest or education in biology. Yet I didn't find the book bringing almost any new perspective or idea that I haven't encountered before. That's an unforgivable disappointment from a prominent and highly achieved scientist.In the book's conclusion, Wilson suggests that: 1. more efficient and clean energy generation, 2. GMO and synthetic biology, 3. artificial intelligence, 4. lesser need to travel due to virtual/augmented reality, 5. declining fertility rates will make the half-earth wilderness possible. That's something I 'common sense' intuited on my own. I hoped the book would elaborate on practical aspects of these trends in the world with uneven distribution of ecosystems, wealth and population, estimate how quickly we need and can get there and suggest policies and governance that could accelerate the trends. Wilson spends no time on such questions. Perhaps he should've partnered an economist (profession he dreads in an earlier chapter) to help him formulate the issues.The Half-Earth slogan and its implications are attractive and potentially sound. I hope someone else will pick it up and write a better book on the same topic."
21,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,2,"The general message that we should dedicate at least half the land of this planet to wilderness is an important one. However, it's pretty shocking what conclusions E.O. Wilson draws from that premise. According to him we need not just more research into biology, which is crazy enough considering that lack of information is clearly not the problem, but also more progress in robotics, nanotechnology, genetic engineering and the ephemeralization of our gadgets (making them smaller and more efficient so we can do more with less). And not to worry because our free-market capitalist economy will supposedly favor the companies who make long-lasting and efficient products, even though that's the complete opposite of what's actually been happening. Rather than challenge economic growth he sees ""extensive growth"" being replaced by ""intensive growth"", which again basically means that people still buy tons of crap they don't need but the impact on the environment won't double every time that GDP does. Sorry but that is not gonna cut it. E.O. Wilson is just too firmly ensconced in the scientific crusade to accept the need for humility. The good things he has to say are contradicted by demanding that we poke and probe every little thing on the planet until we know how to control everything. It really makes no sense."
22,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,3,"Overall I like the ecological concept of reserving half of the earth non water surface to support the other half and to promote biodiversity. This book blended a lot of current conservation concepts however execution of all of these concepts for the full execution of the half earth concept seems unsustainable provided the growing population. To throw another concept in that Edward Wilson did not think about is that society could build central population areas taller freeing up more of the land masses for conservation and food cultivation. By building centralized cities up and then apportioning a conserved quantity of land per population in that city, he may get the space needed to support a healthy earth. Can we get there as a society, yes. It may not be a carnivorous society and we may need to apportion 2 acres per person, but it is achievable. Just my 2 cents and thumbs up on this concept :)"

Wilson's new book puts that fear in perspective. We know precious little about the diversity of our world and at the rate we are going millions of species of plants and animals will go extinct before we even know about them. The ultimate in ignorance is bliss.Preserving diversity is the key to solving so many of our problems, be they political, scientific, cultural, etc. Some years ago the Savannah River Nuclear site opened up a fenced off contaminated area. No human had set foot in these thousands of acres for decades. Biologists were astonished at the health and diversity of the ""contaminated area."" Wilson just has a wonderful way of describing the wonder and awe of discovery and what we will lose if humans do not get a handle on resource consumption and climate change. Go, EO!"
24,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505757-mark-valentine,4,"Based on the evidence, setting aside even more than half of our earth's area for preservation makes sense but I don't think corporate and national interests will allow this. Wilson's documentation of habitat lose, the rise of invasive species, pollution, over-population, and over-hunting indicates that we have very, very little time left. When combined with methane and CO2 gas emissions, I believe that we need a frantic mobilization of resources now. I can only fault Wilson with one piece of naivete and that has to do with his assumption that AI and technology will save us from the coming extinctions. We have the resources now; even to signal that we should wait for some future salvation shows that a fly has fallen into his scientific ointment."

I realise I have only the vaguest knowledge about the stupendous, awesome, complex world we live in.Living with the knowledge of the sixth extinction has been something I have been doing for many years but the shear love Edward Wilson has for all forms of life on this blue ball floating in space adds immensely to the feeling of horror.It is a lot to digest, I've now ordered one of his earlier books.This clearly meets my criteria for 5 stars, I learnt a great deal, it's beautifully and passionately written and I would definitely give it to others to read"

Unfortunately, it gets pretty darn technical and scientifically worded in lots of the text, making it difficult to stay with and follow. That being said, the message is very clear. We are killing the place where we live and we might or might not be able to make some changes to keep it alive. No, this is not just about climate change, but also about killing flora and fauna and nature's systems that sustain us. The final 50 or so pages, titled ""Solutions"" is more than stimulating. A pretty important read."

He lists a bunch of ""best places"" for biodiversity (determined in consultation with 18 leading ecologists) that we should focus on first, some of which I'd never heard of (e.g. Socotra). The bad: He doesn't specifically dig into how exactly we should set aside half of the earth for wilderness. This is an idea I agree with, so--what should we do? What's the first step? Some of the text is redundant, and some of it feels condescending (how many times does he have to mention that ""genera"" is the plural of ""genus?""). The last bit about AI felt tangential.

They are not gardens to be arranged and tended for our delectation. They are not recreation centers or harborers of natural resources or sanatoriums or undeveloped sites of business opportunities - of any kind. The wildlands and the bulk of Earth's biodiversity protected within them are another world from the one humanity is throwing together pell-mell. What do we receive from them? The stabilization of the global environment they provide and their very existence are the gifts they give to us. We are their stewards, not their owners. End of quote, pp. 84-5The importance of this book lies in chapter 20, ""Threading the Bottleneck,"" where Wilson writes:""The key to saving one-half of the planet is the ecological footprint, defined as the amount of space required to meet all of the needs of an average person. It comprises the land used for habitation, fresh water, food production and delivery, personal transportation, communication, governance, other public functions, medical support, burial, and entertainment. In the same way the ecological footprint is scattered in pieces around the world, so are Earth's surviviing wildlands on the land and in the sea. The pieces range in size from the major desert and forest wildernesses to pockets of restored habitats as small as a few hectares."" p.189And then ensues a discussion of the critical question of the Anthropocene: human population growth.""But, you may ask, doesn't a rising population and per-capita consumption doom the Half-Earth prospect or any other measure aimed at confining the Anthropocene? It does, but only if the human population continues growing as it has in the past, through the remainder of the twenty-first century and on into the twenty-second century. In this aspect of its biology, however, humanity appears to have won a throw of the demographic dice. Its population growth has begun to decelerate autonomously, without pressure one way or the other from law or custom. In every country where women have gained some degree of social and financial independence, their average fertility has dropped by a corresponding amount through individual personal choice. In Europe and among native-born Americans, it has already reached and continued to hold below the zero-growth threshold of 2.1 children per woman surviving to maturity. Given even a modest amount of personal freedom and an expectation of future security, women choose the option of what ecologists call K-selection, that favoring a small number of healthy well-prepared offspring, as opposed to r-selection, hedging the bet with a larger number of poorly prepared offspring."" (p.190)This speaks to the need to educate and empower young girls and women in the developing world.E.O. Wilson is an optimist and provides us with a version of the future that might save the planet.""...(b)y 2100 the world population, even as it decelerates toward zero growth, will reach between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion, up from the 7.2 billion in 2014.That is a heavy burden for an already overpopulated planet to bear,but unless women worldwide switch back from the negative population trend of fewer than 2.1 children per woman, a turn downward n the early twenty-second century is inevitable."" p. 191"
41,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61202980-zdzich,4,"The book is extremely informative providing the readers with a great deal of interesting facts and examples. It was really pleasant to read one more book written by a person who is really conscious of the problems related to the natural environment and are not ignorant of the current state of affairs on the Earth.Yet, there were two issues in this excellent book which have evoked some doubts in me.The first one is a rather popular opinion among the modern naturalists and environmentalists. This issue is the belief in the increase of population being a too heavy burden for our planet. According to these opinions, many scientists and other people who are interested in the future of the natural world, consider the families of underdeveloped countries with many children to be the greatest enemies of the environment. I am afraid it doesn’t work this way. Our planet is suffering from overconsumption which is actually the fault of the most developed countries. As for me, it is really odd to regard a family with ten children who can hardly live up to the age of 20 because of malnutrition, lack of clear water and basic medical help as people who are usurping the natural environment. These people are not using even a quarter of all those products which are available on the modern market of the most developed countries. These people do not drive cars on a daily basis, neither do they through away megatons of plastic wastes annually. Therefore, I suppose the theory of a single child living a healthy and long life according to the rules of the greatest modern civilizations as a better solution for the Earth since such a person will consume far more products during one’s healthy life than a big family living below the poverty line.Furthermore, I can’t agree with another attitude of the author which is, although being quite positive, is unfortunately unrealistic. This is the vision of the modern technology and the rules of the market which the author describes to us. Of course, there was quite a long period in history when the manufacturers were focused entirely on the excessive production of goods which weren’t necessarily of the highest quality. Then, there was a short period when the technological progress brought really effective solutions to various problems related to the processes of production and consumption, thus, increasing the quality of the final products. Still, it didn’t prove “business-friendly”. It is not efficient for any company to produce a small amount of extremely sophisticated goods which can be used during a long period of time. It is obvious that the majority of the manufacturers use various tricks which lead to a quick spoilage of their goods just in order to make you buy another one. As a result, there is absolutely no way of connecting such a policy with an image of the future safe for both people and the natural environment."
42,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,2,"This should have just been a nature documentary. I was ready for a book about the details of how to save half the earth's surface area to preserve biodiversity, some more about the numbers (Wilson doesn't discuss habitat fragmentation-- he makes it sound like a checkerboard pattern of wilderness is okay as long as the area is there, and he barely even mentions edge effects. When he does it's more of an offhand comment about predation and not about the actual ratio of of interior habitat to edge habitat, etc.) The vast majority of this book is just about biodiversity itself, and he doesn't even mention the solution the book is named after until the very end when he has no more time to actually discuss it. He also seems to conflate anthropocene with anthropocentric. ""Anthropocene"" is a description (and an accurate one at that), not an excuse. And I'm not sure about how he dismisses ""novel ecosystems"". All ecosystems were novel at some point. Of course it's bad to throw invasive species around the globe willy-nilly, but not all alien species are invasive, and species move around and colonize new ecosystems on their own. If you have a situation where you fucked up and killed off all the large ungulates in your area, you might as well replace them with cows. The ecosystem wants that niche to be filled, and if you don't like de-extinction and you don't have time to wait for the other species to adapt to the new conditions (which you probably don't, because humans keep changing things too fast for evolution to keep up and the ecosystems were already vulnerable), why not fill the niche with a species that's alive? Of course it's not ideal, loss of biodiversity is never good, but the ecosystem health will be a lot better if you let vacant niches be filled. And what would Wilson have said about the first seeds to land on a new volcanic island, or the first birds to fly there, the first mammals to float there on driftwood, etc? What about the first amphibian eggs to hitch a ride on bird feet-- that's introduction by another species (like what humans do). The only thing wrong with how humans do it is the scale, not the action itself. We obviously need to tone down the whole ""taking over the world and driving extinctions at a ridiculous rate and screwing up the climate even when we know better"" thing, but we don't need to follow the Prime Directive on a planet that we evolved on along with everybody else.Oh, and I almost forgot, toward the end of the book he randomly decides to be optimistic about free-market economics-- you know, the thing that got us into this mess to begin with.

43,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2753253-lyndsay,2,"This book was highly recommended to me, and I went into it hoping for a new perspective on how to solve the crisis we have started. But he offers more fear and less action. If you are already versed on the topics of ecology and biodiversity this isn't an essential read. If you aren't then this is a good book outlining why we should care (spoiler alert: we really, really should). It is not a very scientific read so is easy to access for anyone but we warned, it can be a bit jumpy and boring."
44,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/646953-patrick,2,"I have long enjoyed Wilson's observations on the natural world, especially the deeper discussions of various species and ecosystems. Those parts of this book were also enjoyable, if not particularly novel. However, the main thesis of the book, that we must set aside half of the world to preserve various ecosystems, is long on need and the case for urgency, and very short on any vision for how this might happen, or even whether it would be effective. Wilson's hope that capitalism will somehow just come to its senses and shift course to answer his call, is frustrating in its naivete. Further, the idea that setting aside tracts of land and seas can actually preserve ecosystems, is looking increasingly unsound as climate change wreaks havoc across the planet. As one example, how are we supposed to preserve Monarchs when it seems from recent reports that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide reduces the medicinal properties of milkweed plants that protect the butterflies from predators and parasites? The reduction in milkweed habitat across the vast Monarch migration zones was already challenging the survival of the species; the change in the biology of the plants due to climate change looks even more serious, and will not be addressed by fencing off some land from developers. This is likely a harbinger of other such cases in which global climate changes will render preserve models ineffective. If so, the outcome is that we either reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases, or we endure vast shifts to the world's ecosystems that may make the planet a much less hospitable place for humans. I applaud Wilson's activism to educate the world about the dangers we face in ignoring ecosystems, and/or in focusing on preservation (only) of signature species. However, he really needs to gather together a broader coalition, including economists and climate researchers, if he hopes to do more than plea for a kinder, gentler world. "

Wilson brings his vast knowledge and experience to work in his newest book Half-Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life.

47,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14278737-james-townsend,4,"Super interesting book. Like so many non-fiction books of this type that lend themselves to a kind of succinct summary, I think a lot of people are balking at actually reading the book before commenting on its content, which is a mistake. Yes, Wilson proposes that we set aside half of the earth's landmass for the preservation of biodiversity. Yes that is a totally wild idea. Wilson himself actually admits that. The thought is that we have fucked up the planet so much, and are set to cause only more disruption, that drastic action is needed, hence this proposal. Furthermore, this is not a policy document, so don't go in expecting a detailed proposal of how this would come to pass. Wilson is merely trying to make the case that, 1. Biodiversity is gravely threatened 2. Biodiversity is an intrinsically good and necessary thing 3. Biodiversity must be protected because the results of not doing so, while unpredictable, are most likely to be some flavor of bad. 4. Biodiversity can be protected by people through preserves, so let's do more of that. Basically. And he makes a good case for all those points. In the process, he shares a lot of great insights and experiences that add up to an interesting read. Plus, it's short, you can probably read it in a day or two, so consider doing so before reacting to it."
48,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3081624-ben,2,"I was expecting a more cogent set of arguments for Wilson's vision of protecting half of the Earth's ecosystems, but this book is more an eclectic collection of anecdotes and natural history observations. Certainly, these are beautifully observed, informed by a lifetime's engagement with the natural world and intensely personal, but this is a book that could have benefited from a good editor. Wilson rejects what he calls the ""Anthropocene worldview"" (that humans are now in control of the planet, and should shape it for our own ends) and argues compellingly that we should instead strive to do no further harm to the biosphere. In presenting the complexity and intricacy of life on Earth, Wilson makes the point that we cannot possibly garden and manage it -- we know far too little about how it works. He's right. But I was left wishing he had devoted more space to how his vision might be achieved in practice, and how the grievous injustices of past ""fortress conservation"" can be avoided. For example, how can conservationists and indigenous people work together to protect forests? Wilson's understanding of ecology and natural history is unequaled, but there is little evidence here that he has engaged with the complex social and political questions that ""Half Earth"" raises. This book, sadly, is no match for his much earlier ""The Diversity of Life""."
49,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5926332-claire,4,"""We should forever bear in mind that the beautiful world our species inherited took the biosphere 3.8 billion years to build. The intricacy of its species we know only in part, and the way they work together to create a sustainable balance we have only recently begun to grasp. Like it or not, and prepared or not, we are the mind and stewards of the living world. Our own ultimate future depends upon that understanding. We have come a very long way through the barbaric period in which we still live, and now I believe we’ve learned enough to adopt a transcendent moral precept concerning the rest of life. It is simple and easy to say: Do no further harm to the biosphere.""I simply quote the last couple of paragraph of the book, that summarize the necessity, the why for the concept - All the rest is building to it - a proof of some sort... Although the book is a bit of a repeat of his previous work (even the concept of Half-Earth is not new in his work), I always enjoy reading E.O.Wilson's work. It resets me, and keeps me alert.Explore further the concept, reading for instance the good Smithsonian Magazine article: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science..."

Thinking with a gabble of reason, emotion, and religion. Lucky accident of primate evolution during the late Pleistocene. Mind of the biosphere. Magnificent in imaginative power and exploratory drive, yet yearning to be more master than steward of a declining planet. Born with the capacity to survive and evolve forever, able to render the biosphere eternal also. Yet arrogant, reckless, lethally predisposed to favor self, tribe, and short-term futures. Obsequious to imagined higher beings, contemptuous toward lower forms of life.” “Conservation scientists often use the acronym HIPPO for a quick recall of the most ruinous of our activities, in order of importance: Habitat destruction, Invasive species, Pollution, Population growth, Overhunting.” “I think it relevant to quote the great explorer-naturalist Alexander von Humboldt on this subject, as true in his time as it is in ours: “The most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those who have not viewed the world.” “As John Stuart Mill once put the essence of discourse, both teachers and learners alike fall asleep when there is no enemy in the field.” "
51,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55304184-aleta,4,"Indeed, you could assess this provocative book as a rambling mess...or the musings of a great thinker. When thought of as a collection of musings, its wandering can be forgiven or even enjoyed. He does the necessary work of introducing the importance and vastness of biodiversity to the non-scientist (I am, in fact, a scientist). That is best done by storytelling, and that he does. This book will leave you with a greater sense of what is at stake, and the wonder of it all. Wilson does not fully develop his concept of the half-earth solution, he merely offers it up. If you consider this book a series of essays, then the title is in fact a title of one of the essays, which would explain that it is not really the topic of the book. Wilson likes to introduce big ideas, and sometimes to develop them as theories. Half-Earth is a big idea, and he starts the conversation. Not many well-known writers in this field are willing to be unabashedly eco-centric. In the human oriented ""resource"" view of nature, the idea of Half Earth is galling. I am glad Wilson specifically takes on the human-centric trend in environmental thinking and action in this book, and reminds us that this is not just our planet. "
52,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54049547-samuel-wells,4,"Wilson continues to call for saving the diversity of life on our increasingly impoverished planet. His is an important voice and Half-Earth needs to be taken seriously. His advocacy for the proposal to set aside half of the earth's land for conservation (not his own idea originally) is certainly controversial. And you won't find in this book hard empirical justification for doing so - justification that one might have expected from one of the co-authors of the theory of island biogeography. That said, the argument is an important one. I wasn't impressed by Wilson's continued fascination with technology. It seems in many ways to conflict with his central thesis: lets give almost free reign to technology so we can set aside vast tracts of land to be free of human intervention. This bothers me because our technological history has certainly not been environmentally friendly. Wilson should know better.His argument against the current errors of anthropocene enthusiasts, however, is right on. This, in my opinion, is the most important part of the book - and the reason why I recommend it for a wide general readership. Biology teachers would do well to make this required reading. "
53,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8512171-nan-williams,4,"I love the way Wilson writes and his method of presenting very complex and esoteric scientific information. Mostly, he writes his books for the general public, the laymen, but never writes as though he's looking down on the non-scientist. His enthusiasm for his subject matter is a real treat to read.Among the things I learned in reading this book was that he and I shared the same professor of zoology at the U of Alabama. And yes, Dr. Chermock was one of my all time favorite professors, but I didn't go further in the field as Dr. Wilson did.Included in the criticisms I've read here on Good Reads is the fact that Wilson gave no answers. Well, not in the sense that a mechanic would in assessing a problem with our car, but I felt greatly enlightened by the knowledge I accumulated via this book and also encouraged by the activities taking place to curb the destruction of global biodiversity. I feel that I have a better understanding of what needs to be done and how I can play a part in it.It was an excellent book, most enjoyable and most enlightening."

I learned a LOT about the earth and about its inhabitants. He wrote well and fairly engaging for a non-fiction. I thought it was going to be all doom and gloom, but it does offer hope at the end. We currently have 15% of the Earth in nature reserves, and he wants to push it to 50% and put cameras in the reserves so people can see the animals on a daily basis--thus giving us more incentive to save the planet. He expresses that all animals are vital to the ecosystem. He thinks our population will top off at 10billion and stay there, but that our technology will naturally decrease the amount of resources we use. So, that is hopeful. We just have to keep the animals alive until we reach that point. He hated the idea of drastic changes such as scrubbing CO2 from the atmosphere or putting a chemical in the ocean to make it alkaline and draw in more CO2, as that would kill many animals."

The first third of the book describes where we're at with the global warming crisis and how urgent a problem it is. The middle third describes existing ecosystems and their importance, and the third section supposedly describes the solution. I felt, however, that Wilson did not provide enough detail about this solution of devoting half the world's land to what amounts to wilderness areas. What countries would set aside this land? How much of each country's land would be required for this solution? What incentives would governments receive for setting aside land? Instead of detail, Wilson went into a chapter-long discussion on artificial intelligence. This book just didn't work for me, although I love the idea of making room for the other millions of species that inhabit this planet. "

57,1631490826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/909198-mary,4,"Edward O. Wilson, famed scientist, is a favorite author of mine. In his latest book, Half-Earth, he describes what humans need to do to save our planet. He describes the interrelatedness and interdependence, the balance, keeping all varieties of plants and animals thriving or vanishing in certain environments He also describes the efforts of two wealthy men to return a couple of locations on earth back into a balanced environment. He points out that there are still unspoiled areas of the world. Half-Earth is his argument against those who believe that our planet exists for humans to use its resources for their advancement and development, and the disappearance of certain species of plants and animals is simply a part of this process.

There are plenty of great examples of the inextricable interconnectedness between all living things. The author beseeches readers to use whatever resources are in their power to move towards a half earth view - let's dedicate half of the world to a pre-'human' level of diversity. What a call to action! I think it should be done. The author is positive about the potential; he spends the last couple chapters in this tour de force of reviewing potentially hopeful technologies that can enable humanity to cut down on resource consumption, and limit ourselves to a 0.5 world. I don't know if this hope is reasonable, ut hey, I think when one has hope, then one can achieve great things... "

Tony Hiss who talks with Wilson for an article in Smithsonian Magazine (http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science...) actually makes Half Earth seem plausible.

It’s heartbreaking (to me) because I don’t believe we will rise to the challenge.
