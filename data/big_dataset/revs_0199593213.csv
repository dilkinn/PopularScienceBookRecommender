(Incidentally, these are also considered to be amongst the cutest of all animals.) Which evolutionary innovation allowed the beetles to evolve such a fabulous diversity of species? How many times have invertebrates and vertebrates colonised land? What dramatic event can be seen only in the DNA of vertebrates? Did you know that fish and reptiles can’t be separated into their own groups simply based on superficial appearances? And did you know that, of the 33 animal phyla, 32 comprise only invertebrates whilst one is a mix of both invertebrates and vertebrates?If you’ve ever been tempted to read and learn about the most up-to-date information about the animal kingdom but don’t want to spend a huge sum of money on an oversized textbook, then you’re going to love reading 
The Animal Kingdom: A Very Short Introduction
 by Peter Holland [2011; Oxford University Press]. In this book, Professor Holland takes us on a whirlwind tour through the higher-level groups (phyla) in the animal kingdom, beginning by defining what is an animal (not as obvious as you’d think!), and providing an overview to the biology of each group of animals, to reviewing relevant DNA data and discussing what these data reveal about evolutionary relationships between animals, and reviewing some of our latest findings from the study of evolution and development — “evo-devo”.This book provides an appealing introduction to and summary of the newest information about animals and thus, it is a compact survey suitable for biology and zoology students as well as a fascinating journey for the interested general reader. Without overburdening the reader with excessive details, this volume discusses the evolutionary relatedness amongst and between groups of animals based on analyses of molecular sequencing data and morphological data matrices.Designed for the busy professional as well as the overworked student, this small paperback fits comfortably into your hand for ease of reading whilst strap-hanging on the subway, for example. It is 126 pages long, and includes tables, drawings and diagrammes, a list of additional readings, and an index. Chapters include:-- What is an animal?-- Animal phyla-- The evolutionary tree of animals-- Basal animals: corals, sponges and jellyfish-- The bilaterians: building a body-- Lophotrochozoa: wondrous worms-- Ecdysozoa: insects and nematodes-- Deuterostomes I: starfish, sea squirts and amphioxus-- Deuterostomes II: the rise of vertebrates-- Deuterostomes III: vertebrates on land-- Enigmatic animalsEven though I really like this book, I do have one quibble: I dislike the author’s overly simplified description of the speciation process. Without naming it as such, he describes what sounds like allopatric speciation and ignores the other mechanisms whereby new species arise. Thus, his description of speciation is not entirely accurate and is woefully incomplete. In my opinion, Professor Holland could have easily devoted at least several paragraphs to describing the basic mechanisms whereby species arise and used a diagram to summarise that information. (But I do think that Oxford should have someone write a book about speciation for their “Very Short Introduction” series.) However, that said, I think this book is an engaging introduction or refresher for those who are interested in learning about a few of the many weird and wonderful animals out there.This small paperback is part of Oxford’s growing collection of “Very Short Introduction” books that collectively have sold more than three million copies around the world. Written by experts in their fields and small enough to fit into a pocket, handbag or rucksack, these slim volumes are interesting, informative and very readable. Based on the titles I’ve read so far, I am a fan of this series because each book provides a readable distillation of its topic.NOTE: Originally published at The Guardian on 23 January 2012."

7,0199593213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61489674-eloise-newman,5,"At the beginning of most biology books, most authors attempt to summarise the history of life into a chapter no matter the subject. This is what the animal kingdom is without the drama and long winded explanation. What Peter Holland has done is explained this very clearly and precisely. The diagrams are extraordinarily helpful and it can be used as a springboard for looking at more topics in depth. It really is a short introduction to the “the tree of life” and the branches composing Animalia. It is brief, but well written enough that you can appreciate the organisation and characteristics of each phylum and class. I recommend this book for all thinking about or studying Biology at uni - particularly first year. "

15,0199593213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107911790-ceri-summers,5,A fascinating read. Wanted to read around my A-Levels and zoology is something that I’ve always found interesting. This concise tour of the animal kingdom was informative and inspiring.
16,0199593213,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"Animals are one of the most familiar and ubiquitous mental categories. They surround all of us, whether they are minuscule flies or oversize pets, and the human history would have been unimaginably different without our oversize reliance on animals. Aside from our daily experience, we learn about animals in school, but unless we end up majoring in biology very few of us go through the trouble of learning about these creatures on a deeper and more systematic level.In ""The Animal Kingdom: A Very Short Introduction"" Peter Holland takes us on a journey of rediscovery of animals in all of their fascinating glory. This book can challenge and radically transform one's understanding of what is meant by the word ""animal."" It turns out that animals are much more diverse and heterogeneous than what most of us suspect. There are estimated millions of species of animals out there, and we'll probably never get a full catalog of them. Like with all other branches of the tree of life, most animals are extremely small or microscopic, live in regions far away from human habitats, and engage in lifestyles that make them extremely hard to detect and study. Even with the known species of animals, the process of categorization and classification can be extremely daunting. For the most of human history, including the past couple of centuries of rapid scientific progress, animals had been categorized in terms of their gross physiological features. This sort of classification worked more or less well for the larger species, but for some smaller ones it created a lot of puzzles. All of this has changed with the advent of DNA analysis which has put the task of animal classification on a much more rigorous footing. DNA analysis has brought about many interesting surprises, and it has shed the new light on the evolution of animals. Thanks to the combination of DNA analysis and some older techniques today we can classify animals into about 33 different phyla. Most of these phyla are completely unknown to anyone but the specialized biologists, and this very short introduction tries to shed some light on at least some of them.One of the most wonderful aspects of this little book is that it always tries to keep the big picture in mind. Its aim is to offer understanding, and not just a dry recitation of various animals, species, and phyla. This approach is invaluable and makes even a book that is filled with recondite classification jargon extremely accessible and even fun to read. The evolution of animal life is one of the nature's greatest adventure stories, and Holland manages to convey much of its excitement. It was very hard for me to put this book down, and I found myself reaching for Wikipedia more often than not in order to find out more about some truly amazing animal species. This is definitely one of the best very short introduction books, and one of my favorite overall popular science books. Anyone who has a desire to understand the diversity of animal life will greatly benefit from going through this short and accessible resource."
