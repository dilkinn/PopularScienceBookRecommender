0,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4606766-scott-johnson,4,"This is a weird one for me....On the one hand, I'm not the intended audience. I understand how computers work more than most, that's literally my job to write the software that runs the internet.On the other, I AM the intended audience, because I have zero clue how computers work on a hardware level.On a mutant third hand, I'm not really the intended audience again, because I intimately understand the physics behind all of the individual components....complex impedence, inductance, breakdown voltages, RF circuit resonances, and so on.I'm in a weird place where I write the high level software that makes computers work. I understand the theory behind programming languages, object-oriented design, system design, compilers, parallel processing and multi-threading..... I also understand the physics behind the components and why transistors are able to function as logic switches, how data is stored and read magnetically on a HDD platter or, more recently, SSD chips.What's missing is the middle bit. How does a circuit I know in and out turn into the operating system I'm modifying?I was hoping this book might answer that question. In a sense, it did, but not at a level that left me satisfied. I understand better how memory registers function and how you build blocks of switches that are hard-wired function machines.But I'm still missing the middle bit: How does what's in that data register (the machine code instruction byte(s)) end up at the correct block within the processor? How does the output get routed to the correct destination after it's computed....how does it know one result goes to the USB controller to get sent back to some peripheral device, but another gets sent to another controller to trigger a disk write to save a file?Sadly, this book didn't answer that for me. That process was hand-waved away and simplified. And so my quest to find a book to fill that gap in my knowledge continues....That said, this book is great at what it does. I can't grade it based on my expectations, but on how good it accomplishes its intended goal. I think it achieves that pretty well, with very little in the way of distractions or unnecessary filler."

I highly recommend it to beginning electrical engineering and biomedical engineering students, as well as those interested in broad-based popular science.It provides a great overview of the fields of electrical engineering and even some biomedical engineering, pulling together many of their interdivisional ideas while covering topics like Boolean algebra/logic, feedback control systems, biology, the brain, evolution, neural networks, computer science and programming, nature vs. nurture debate, cognitive psychology, imaging/image processing, signals & systems, technology, ethics, philosophy and even history.It contains an inquisitive feel that is integral to a true understanding of engineering. It also has some broad based questions that students should be made to think about and maybe eventually solve. It wonderfully ties together a lot of theory in to a coherent text that will help create better engineers (and even thinkers). How do we create questions and then go about answering them. Lots of students suffer from not knowing how all the theory and knowledge interrelate. This book helps synthesize many things into a better whole and allows the reader to see the small pieces that integrate into the big picture."
2,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8211260-ovidiu-neatu,4,A good preview of what computer science is about.For a person who wants to join the field this may give a hint for paths you can chose from within the domain.
3,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,3,"Daniel Hillis conceived of this book to explain the holistic view of the modern day computer, how hardware and software combine to generate the final products that we the users see. In a way he succeeded in explaining the concepts such that any person with minimal background knowledge on computers can understand.My qualms with this book are more because of me rather than the book itself. I had picked this book in the hope that it will somehow explain to me how the logic gates and their operations are scaled up to create a programmable system but the book fell short. The question was glossed over...may be it was to reduce complexity or the author did not think it was important, like I said the problem was me and I am sure the author did not write this book with me in mind. I've also read a book with a similar intent D is for Digital by Brian Kernighan which was better written and a bit systematic, not to mention more recent...Though I've labored enough on this point, for the last time the problem with this book was me rather than the book itself and the reader should check it out for themselves to determine from the content what is wheat and what is chaff."
4,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"The Pattern on the Stone : The Simple Ideas that Make Computers Work (1999) by Danny Hillis is an excellent book by an important figure in computing history. If you're looking for an impressively short book to get an overview of how computers work this is definitely worth reading. Hillis starts from the ground up, describing how switches can be combined to perform more complicated operations. Then what programming does and how programming languages work are described. Hillis goes on to Turing Machines and computability, heuristics and algorithms. Parallel computing and neural networks are also covered. For the length the coverage is remarkable. But the book doesn't quite join up the basics of operation with how programs sit on top of a computer, that is to say the role of operating systems isn't well described. However, The Pattern on the Stone is overall a very good book and would be ideal for anyone who wants to start getting and understanding of computers. Code by Charles Petzold is possibly a slightly better book but it is twice as long. The Pattern on the Stone is definitely worth reading. "
5,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42272701-prashob-m,5,An awesome book on classic computer science from addition operation to inception of AI within 200 pages is remarkable feat and author's lucid writing style and concise content make it delightful read.
6,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608811-david,5,"I was very, very impressed by The Pattern on the Stone. Hillis explains, in terms that anyone can understand, how computers work from the most basic principals. A previous familiarity with any or all of the principals will make understanding easier, but is entirely unnecessary. There is no prerequisite to reading this book.I will be completely honest: I don't think there is any one topic in this book that I had not already explored in other reading. However, I've never seen it all described together in one seamless narrative before! That's an amazing feat, especially considering the brevity of the book.Computer Science is a huge subject with applications (and implications) that reach far beyond crunching numbers. Hillis describes many mind-expanding topics, such as Turing's hypothesis of universal computing, with wonderful lucidity and clarity.The ability to put together a book like this with just the right amount of information to be clear, but no more, is rare. I'm sure the author's temptation to write much more on each topic was very strong.I honestly believe everyone should read this book. People with no previous knowledge of the computer sciences would benefit enormously. Those of us who're already familiar with some or all of the topics will still, I think, gain insight by seeing the big picture. At the very least, it will surely jog the memory quite thoroughly. Even if all of those reasons fail, it's a quick, thoughtful read.Other interesting note: I thought Daniel Hillis' name seemed familiar. I was delighted to discover he's also the creator of the ""Clock of the Long Now"", the 10,000 year clock, a project that has long been a fascination of mine. ""Holy crap,"" I thought, ""he's that Daniel Hillis!"" Here's Hillis on the clock:I want to build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every one hundred years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years. If I hurry I should finish the clock in time to see the cuckoo come out for the first time.Awesome stuff!"
7,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/230249-rachel-smalter-hall,4,"I was super excited to dig into this book and FINALLY understand everything there is to know about computers! It promised to be written for morons like me who didn't understand the first thing about input, output, and boolean logic gates. Transistors, what? Functional abstraction??? Anyway, I think I sort-of get it now. Hillis is pretty good at transforming all that linear engineer stuff into a narrative that I can grasp and understand. Nevertheless, it's all still a little bit hazy, and the last half of the book was sort-of a bore -- the 4th grade approach to otherwise interesting topics such as algorithms, heuristics, sorting, parallel computing and artificial intelligence."
8,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Though dated, this is a still-relevant high-level basic tour on the architecture of digital computers. It goes through the processor, memory, disk, and how computation is executed through these and other components. One big omission of detail is anything to do with circuit topology and gate-logics. Though, a good layman book on that is ""The Engineer and the Logician"", parts of which are fairly technical, and thus at a slightly higher level of difficulty with respect to written detail.This book has charms of its own. Early in the text, the author uses the construction and functioning of a hydraulic tube-based analogue computer, which sort of fills in for the dearth on the topic circuitry. In effect, the author seems to be making the connection between this analogue computer as a type of ""system dynamic"", and uses this construct as his way of characterizing computers.This choice of narrative isn't surprising since the book was written within the decade bound by the mid-1980s to the mid-90s when Chaos theory was ascendant. The author makes reference to self-organizing systems, artificial evolution, and emergence at several points in the book, especially when discussing the notion of intelligence towards the end of the text.This book would be great for someone of any age getting into computing. Perhaps read as an ancillary text in their CS101 course, or just for pleasure by someone already in the field, but who may operate at a much higher level of abstraction (software), and want to review how instruction is carried out at a more literal level.My only critique is the author is a bit naive in his perception that intelligence may evolve from the architecture of the internet. Though, he was hardly unique in this naivete for thinkers in computing at the time. Recommend"
9,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22203333-mark-miller,3,"Since I have a Computer Science degree, I found this an easy read. Nevertheless, I learned some things from it. I think only a basic understanding of CS, and high school math, is necessary to understand what Hillis talks about in it, which is a compliment to what he gets across.I'd say this book is divided into two subjects:First, what a computer is. Some satisfying things about it are he covers both analog and digital computers, what characterizes them, and the advantages of each, though he mostly covers/prefers digital computers (and he states why); quantum computing, and why it's still theoretical; and I think importantly, parallel computing, and where it's most useful. He talks about how the best use of parallel computation is a misunderstood subject, even within the field.Second, he gets into what computers can and can't do. He talks about this with simplicity and clarity.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in, or currently taking computer science in school. It is a good complement to what a typical CS curriculum covers."
10,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47032429-kenta-suzuki,4,"This book is good for someone who wants to understand overall concepts of CS; hardware, software, algorithms, artificial intelligence. This book scratches the surface of these subjects and this does not go into depth. This book may not be for type of person who likes to study calculus with precise limit approach (meaning that clear and rigorous definition are better than fuzzy explanation to understanding) since there are lots of abstractions and analogy of concepts in this book which some people do not clear. For FYI, Alan Kay recommends this book to understand CS concepts https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-be... "
11,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1452001-chris,4,"A nice short book explaining generally how computers work, from things like boolean logic, to how we build up complex architectures, to more advanced topics like parallel and evolutionary computing. I read this to see if it might be something my kids could read, or could be a general explanation for various people. I think if you're interested in computers, and want an easy to read explanation of the basics of how they work and a few other topics, it's a nice short read."
12,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30897464-mark-schulz,3,Not quite sure who is the intended audience for this book. Many of the explanations are quite short. If I wasn’t already a computer engineer I would have found some explanations left me a little in the dark. I understand that the book was intended to be short but I felt that a little more detailed explanation would improve the experience for the reader. Would I attempt to write a book like this - no way. It is far too Duffy for me.
13,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23878945-mitch-mckinnon,4,"This book took familiar concepts and was able to explain them in terms that were not too complex. I was a bit (pleasantly) surprised by the advanced topics that it ventured into by the end and it's fun to read his perspective as we see some of these technologies becoming realized right now. Since the book was written in 1998, the age is definitely starting to show in some of the language used."
14,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116131320-elizabeth,5,Very informative and easy to read. It gives me an overall view about the theories of computation which made me appreciate computing advances more without the need to deal with technical jargons. It is a very good read for beginners who do not have any knowledge in this field and want to learn more and have a good overall picture
15,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114863805-omar-nuboer,0,Amazing explanation of building blocks that make a computer. I highly recommend this for anyone who does not have an information technology background but wants to learn. I read this book specifically before I start ramping up my coding self-education. 
16,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27455217-nick-jones,4,Remarkably relevant for a tech book from the 90s. The concepts haven’t changed much since the 60s so it might be just as useful in 30 years as it is now. Excellent for somebody who doesn’t care to know the particulars of computer science and is happy with a general overview.

19,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4485647-joni-baboci,5,"A fantastic brief read describing the hardware and logic of programming. If I would have read this at 14, I probably would not be an architect today. Highly recommended."
20,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48895956-sananab,1,"In the first chapter, he writes about what a precocious child he was again, and again, and again, and again. That's more psychology than I want in a computer science book."
21,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53770425-huy-vo,4,"This book is for people who have just got into computing or computer-related fields. After reading this book, you'll see the world as simple as an electrical switch with on and off buttons (say 1 and 0 in bits). For instance, a light can be either on or off (1 or 0). A house is either built or unbuilt. An idea could be either developed or undeveloped. You haven't thought of them as a same thing before? Well, me neither..but we'll change this.The book will give you a deeper dig into more fascinating things. From a fairly simple tic-tac-toe machine which is also built out of a hundred of switches (that are either on or off describing either X or O), to a complicated thing like a computer or a robot which has millions of switches (what we call transistors today). Interestingly, they all work the same. They may seemingly have a lot of differences and but it's the same PATTERN being used on every machines nowadays."
22,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57288485-lawrence,5,"I think it is a marvelous introductory book to the field of CS. It guides you to a glimpse of a number of most tempting aspects of this subject, although it is not in-depth and detailed. At least it triggered my motive to study CS for at least 4 years in the university."
23,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2348903-greg-talbot,4,"Our dependence on computers is hardly questionable. Email, social media, typing, and searching for information, it's hard to imagine going back to the old days.Hillis is a book about ideas. Ideas about what computers are, some processes they are involved with, and the future of what computers can be. Some of my favorite things from the book is how Hillis deconstructs what computers are. Using the simple functions - and, or, invent, he not only opens the doors to programming instructions and languages, he gives some unique examples, a hydraulic tic-tac toe game, or creating a rock-paper-scissors game via winning strategies. Quoting Gregory Bateson, information is ""the difference that makes a difference"". ""Pattern on the Stone"" won't help you build the rocket ship, but it will give an appreciate for it's design and power."
24,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"After reading this, I think I should add a ""logic gates"" unit to my intro logic course, explaining the relevance of Boolean logic to the foundations of computer science. The opening sections of this book would be ideal for teaching undergrads that material. This also contains some anti-""What Computers Can't Do"" disses if you're into that kind of thing. "
25,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68029956-paul,4,"A very interesting book. As Hillis points out in the intro, anyone reading Pattern on the Stone will likely already be familiar with most of the concepts involved, but his simple, elegant description of the basics of computing is never less than fascinating. The bootstrapping through layers of abstraction is particularly well-described, and this book marks the first time that I actually understood what would make quantum computing so powerful. The only downside of this book is Hillis's random interjections of AI wishful thinking nonsense; e.g., he thinks that the Internet will become . . . uh . . . a self-aware AI? Given that this book was published in 1998 I guess we can count that one out! But these moments are mercifully rare."
26,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1666575-senthil-kumaran,5,"Clearly written account on what is Computer Science. This is book is not about technology, but the concepts and ideas which make the computers work. While reading the first chapter itself, I recollected the Computer Built using MineCraft (Check the video in youtube if you did not know already) because it details about Computers built using sticks. It goes on to explain about Finite state machines, computer architecture, Programming languages and storage, error detecting and error correcting codes, parallelism and our path to future. Author tries to help the readers realize their kinship with computers. Draws the parallels to how our brains think and how computer operate."
27,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,5,"This is everything that popular science writing should be, and it's the product not of a professional writer, but of an engineer who clearly loves what he does. Full of clever, non-technical analogies and explanations that make you go ""Ah, OK! That's what people mean by that term!"" Also helpful is a warning before a tricky section, explaining that if you get lost you'll still follow the rest of the book. Hillis, a long-time AI evangelist, says some not very nice things about philosophers of mind - this book escapes its remit to follow avenues of emergent intelligence, quantum mechanics and biological models for computing. Not one boring page. Five stars. "
28,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4895150-nayef-ahmad,5,"Lucid and concise. And there's no question that the author knows his stuff: in the 1980s, he pioneered the idea of massively parallel computing, which is now ubiquitous in supercomputers. Excerpt: ""Of course, I had heard of Amdahl's Law [check Wikipedia]... yet I was certain, though I could not prove it, that Amdahl's Law did not apply to the problems I was trying to solve. The reason I was so confident was that the problems I was working on had already been solved on a massively parallel processor - the human brain. I was a student at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT, and I wanted to build a machine that could think."" "
29,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50800952-eyana,4,"Provides comprehensive introduction about fundamentals in computer science. I still find this book too verbose for beginners, but concepts introduced are good starting point for further study and research.

30,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159325-emily,4,"This is a great introduction to computers, especially on the hardware side. I thought that I would be ""beyond it,"" but my knowledge of what actually goes on inside the computer turns out to be pretty small. :) Since the basics of computers have stayed similar over the years, it is remarkably relevant for a computer book of its age, and concludes with an interesting disucssion of AI that makes me want to dig more into the subject. I definitely recommend it -- for budding computer scientists and hobbyists alike."
31,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55631754-chris,3,I like the concept of the book but mostly felt disappointed. The illustrations are crude and a wasted opportunity. Hillis's discussion of algorithm versus heuristics is unhelpful as he implies that an algorithm that uses heuristics is not an algorithm (?). I have never seen such an opinion before. His obsession with parallel computing shines through and he rather quickly waves his hands at his objectors. 
32,046502596X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8396455-john-orman,3,"How do computers really work? That is the question this book attempts to answer.
