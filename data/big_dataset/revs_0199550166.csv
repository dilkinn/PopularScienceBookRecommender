It's got a slightly odd narrative; it kicks off by laying out all the ideas that exist about antimatter and it's possibilities and then ends by saying but actually none of that is true or possible.What Close does tell us about antimatter is, however, really interesting. The book is well organised into fairly short chapters so it's not a struggle to follow and keep on top of what you're thinking about at a given time. Definitions are often refreshed so it's no huge drama if you forget what a lepton is from one chapter to the next! I'm quite sure I've understood and retained less than half of it, but it's written really well and maintains a good sense of the big concepts that you can just about grasp.Regardless of how much I have or haven't learnt, I really enjoyed the experience of reading this book."

The beginning gave the impression of being more of a popular science book with lots of bad jokes and whatnot but things grew in complexity to the point where I was rereading certain sentences again and again. I don't regret reading it because its specificity to antimatter makes it different than the more general physics material I've read (like when I read that book on black holes, The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics), but it was tough going. It's also almost 10 years out of date now, so if I really want to know about antimatter, I'm going to have to update myself on the more recent discoveries."
2,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"Pop culture uses a lot of science buzzwords that it doesn't well understand. Words like ""quantum mechanics"", ""relativity"" and ""antimatter"" get thrown around all the time in books, action movies, and science fiction with very little awareness of their reality. Though it is a great way to introduce people to science, but leads to misunderstanding, and even fear. I'm glad Close wrote this nifty little book to help fix some of these . In this short volume, (yes another one, I know), ""Antimatter"" looks at the history and science of these strange particles that are annihilated by their matter counterparts. Reviewing the history of antimatter from Dirac's early theorizing of their existence to modern research in laboratories worldwide, Close's accessible writing lets you understand much of the dark matter(tee-hee) surrounding not only antimatter, but subatomic physics as a whole. He also examines claims of a lump of antimatter hitting Tunguska, Russia in 1908, as well as the economic feasibility of antimatter propulsion and weaponry. Close's chapter on matrices was a bit clunky, but the rest of the book was easy to comprehend. If you have a couple hours to kill, and want to know about subatomic physics, this is a really great read."

4,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63804580-arno-mosikyan,5,"EXCERPTS:In the entire universe, as far as we can tell, matter and not antimatter is the norm. It seems that the destruction of antimatter was one of the first acts after the Big Bang. If a lump of matter is your fuel, then antimatter is the spark that will release its energy in ways that, theoretically at least, cannot be bettered in nature. This is why some have cited the Tunguska event to have been the result of antimatter hitting the atmosphere. The positron did not pre-exist within that atom any more than a bark exists inside a dog; it was the energy release that created it. The positron flies away from the atom and lives only so long as it avoids meeting an electron. As our world is made of atoms, which all contain electrons, the positron soon bumps into one, these counterbalanced opposites disappearing in a flash of gamma rays, which is light far beyond the part of the spectrum that our eyes can see. Special instruments however can detect these rays, which are exploited in medicine in the PET scanner— positron emission tomography. Antimatter destroys, but in controlled circumstances this can paradoxically be a life saver.On a larger scale, nature produces positrons in the heart of the sun. The sunlight that shines on us today is in part a result of positrons that were created in the centre of the sun some 100,000 years ago, only to be annihilated almost immediately. The sun is mostly hydrogen, the simplest element. In its centre where the temperature exceeds 10 million degrees, the hydrogen atoms are disrupted into their component pieces, electrons and protons swarming independently and at random. The protons occasionally bump into one another and through a sequence of processes link together, eventually forming the seed of helium, which is the next simplest element. Helium is the ash from this fusion reaction and has less mass than the protons that were used to make it. This loss in mass has turned into energy, E = mc2 at work, which is ultimately the energy that emerges as sunlight. So what do positrons have to do with this? A helium nucleus contains two protons and two neutrons. Under suitable circumstances a proton can change into a neutron and emit energy some of which materializes as a positron, similar to what happens in the positron emitters of earthly medicine. The positron finds itself in the heart of the sun, where there are lots of electrons, and is instantly destroyed, turned into gamma rays. These try to rush away at the speed of light but are interrupted by the crowd of electrically charged particles, electrons, and protons that form the seething star. Buffeted this way and that, repeatedly absorbed by electrons and then emitted with less energy than before, it will take a hundred thousand years before gamma rays manage to reach the surface, hundreds of thousands of kilometers above. In doing so the rays lose lots of energy, their character changing from X-rays to ultra-violet and at last into the rainbow of colours that are visible to our eyes. So daylight is the result of antimatter being produced in the heart of the sun and, in part, of its annihilation. It would require more than a billion atoms in a chemical explosive to produce as much energy as could be liberated by the annihilation of a single electron. Annihilate a single gram of antimatter, (about 1/25th of an ounce), and you would obtain as much energy as you could get from the fuel tanks of two dozen conventional space shuttles. Positron energy conversion would be a revolutionary energy source which would interest those who wage war as just half a gram explosively equates to 20 kilotons, the size of the bomb at Hiroshima.4 It is no surprise then that if antimatter can be produced and stored until needed, it has the potential for power that would interest the space industry, or for weapons that would excite the military. I have no doubt that these possibilities are being actively investigated. This book will tell the story of antimatter, what it is, how it was discovered, how we can make it, and what opportunities and threats it could pose. It will also assess the reality of antimatter as fuel for space odysseys and for weapons. So, what is antimatter? Saying that it is the opposite of matter is easy on the ear, but what actually is ‘opposite’ about it? Nearly all of the atoms of oxygen that you breathe, and of the carbon in your skin or the ink on this page, were made in stars about five billion years ago when the earth was first forming. So we are all stardust or, if you are less romantic, nuclear waste, for stars are nuclear furnaces with hydrogen as their primary fuel, starlight their energy output and assorted elements their ‘ash’ or waste products. So even at the basic level of atoms, matter and antimatter look the same: the source of their contrast is buried deeper still. The force of gravity rules the galaxies, planets, and falling apples, and keeps our feet on the ground. However it is electric and magnetic forces that give us shape and structure. The electromagnetic force is much more powerful than gravity, but in bulk matter the attractions and repulsions of the positive and negative charges tend to cancel out, leaving the all-attractive force of gravity as dominant. Such a swapping of charges would turn what we know as matter into what we call antimatter. An anti-atom of antihydrogen would consist of a negative ‘antiproton’ encircled by a positively charged ‘positron’. Paul Dirac, who first predicted that such a mirror image of matter should exist, summarized this enigma on receiving his Nobel Prize in 1933: We must regard it rather as an accident that the Earth (and presumably the whole Solar System) contains a preponderance of negative electrons and positive protons. It is quite possible that for some of the stars it is the other way about, these stars being built up mainly of [positively charged electrons] and negative protons. When large numbers of atoms are involved, Newton’s laws of certainty emerge from the underlying quantum rules. It is these quantum laws, when combined with Einstein’s theory of relativity, that reveal that just one form of matter is not enough: the act of creation in the Big Bang must have made two counterbalanced varieties. Said another way: in a millionth of a second an electron makes more circuits of the central proton than the earth has made around the sun in its entire history. The emergence of substance from pure energy, of which the purest form is light, is almost biblical in scope. With antimatter, the negative image of matter, we make contact with the gods of creation.There’s matter, like the electron; antimatter, like the positron; and then there are things that are neither matter nor antimatter. The most familiar example of something that is beyond substance is electromagnetic radiation. All electromagnetic radiation, from gamma rays through X-rays and ultra-violet to visible light, infrared, and radio waves, consists of photons of different energies. Matter and antimatter can cancel one another out, their annihilation leaving non-substance in the form of photons; if the conditions are right this sequence can happen in reverse where photons turn into pieces of matter and antimatter. The photon of light is just one example of over a hundred known examples of particles that are non-substance. Such entities are known as ‘bosons’, after the Indian physicist Satyendranath Bose. By contrast, substantial particles that are basic pieces of matter or of antimatter are known as ‘fermions’, after the Italian Enrico Fermi. The behaviour of fermions is described by Dirac’s equation; bosons follow different rules. One of the results of Dirac’s work was the discovery that the electromagnetic field itself is ruled by quantum theory. Photons are particle-like bundles of electromagnetic radiation, and they transmit the electromagnetic force as they flit between one charged particle and another. In modern ‘quantum field theory’, not just the electromagnetic force but all the forces are transmitted by bosons. What the photon does for the electromagnetic force, so the ‘graviton’ is believed to do for gravity. No one has yet detected a graviton, but few doubt that it exists and that some day it will be found. The battle between matter and antimatter in the universe was fought fourteen billion years ago, and matter won. Fermions give rise to structure, they have stability and lead to life. We are formed from atoms that have existed for billions of years, it is only now that they are configured in combinations that think they are us. We breathe in oxygen, exhale carbon dioxide, grow and die, but our atoms will go on. Their basic pieces will recombine with infinite variety into the distant future, so long as they do not meet antimatter. Dehmelt had proved what the theorists suspected: we live in a world of matter, but the vacuum is full of both ‘virtual’ antimatter and ‘virtual’ matter, virtual in the sense that it does not materialize (maybe that should read ‘anti-materialize’) but whose presence can be inferred by its effects on passing particles of matter. One of the implications of Stueckelberg’s diagrams was that an antiparticle could be regarded as a particle that was travelling backwards in time. This creates mental images of antimatter being truly exotic; that in watching positrons we are sensing electrons arriving from the future. If in the first moment matter and antimatter emerged equally from the Big Bang, an instant later they should have annihilated one another. This gives another perspective on the question. The mystery is less about why antimatter has disappeared, and more a question of why has matter survived? Perhaps the answer is that there is some difference between them, that they are not perfect mirrors of one another. The complex interactions that make amino-acids, DNA, and life will equally allow anti-elements to make everything in anti-DNA, even anti-life. The chemistry of antimatter is the same as matter: antiplanets and antimatter in all its forms are as realizable as the more familiar matter which dominates the known universe. Are antigalaxies of antistars surrounded by antiplanets of antimatter awaiting unsuspecting astronauts in the far reaches of the universe? How sure are we that there is no antimatter at large, out there somewhere? How can we know the make-up of a distant star, seen only as a faint candle across the vastness of space? All we see from earth is the starlight and as we have no reason to suppose that the spectra of the anti-elements are any different from those of the elements, we cannot tell stars from antistars simply by looking out into the night sky. All of the evidence suggests that, with the exception of transient antiparticles produced like the above, everything within several hundred million light years of us is made of matter. This is a huge volume, to be sure, but only a fraction of the visible universe. There is still a lot of unexplored space where antimatter could dominate. Could matter and antimatter have become separated into large independent domains? On the average every five cubic metres of outer space contains one proton, no antiprotons and ten billion quanta of radiation. Everything that we know about the early universe, from theory, observations and the results of experiments at LEP, suggests that in the hot aftermath of the Big Bang those numbers would have been ten billion quanta of radiation, ten billion antiprotons, and ten billion and one protons. The inference is that one of the first acts after creation was a Great Annihilation such that the matter-dominated universe today is made from the surviving one out of ten billion protons. Everything out there today is the remnant of an even grander creation. So whereas chemical reactions convert just one part in a billion of matter’s trapped energy, nuclear reactions can liberate up to about 1 per cent. If we could transform larger fractions of matter into energy, our ambitions would expand in parallel. In principle we could liberate the full mc2 latent within matter into energy. That is the promise of antimatter.All cultures have wondered about their origins, and the paradox of how something came from nothing. Why the Big Bang occurred no one yet knows, but out of its energy everything that we know was born. And it is beams of antimatter, first antiprotons and then positrons, that have enabled us to simulate the early universe in experiments, and begin to understand what it was like when less than a billionth of a second old. This is an astounding achievement of the human intellect: of groups of atoms collected together and able to think, to look out in wonder at the universe that made us, and build machines that can revisit our origins in the Big Bang. And the tool that made all this possible is antimatter. With such inspirations in fact, who needs fiction?"
5,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74503248-samsara,4,"Short but concise. Manage to get anti-matter explained clearly. Smart choice of topic. It might be wise to focus in one topic, and do it well!Though, it still has not explained why nothing can give Boson and Fermion, both energy and matter (as well as anti-matter). We don't know, right?=============================================A helium nucleus contains two protons and two neutrons. Under suitable circumstances a proton can change into a neutron and emit energy some of which materializes as a positron. The positron finds itself in the heart of the sun, where there are lots of electrons, and is instantly destroyed, turned into gamma rays. Buffeted this way and that, repeatedly absorbed by electrons and then emitted with less energy than before, it will take a hundred thousand years before gamma rays manage to reach the surface. In doing so the rays lose lots of energy, their character changing from X-rays to ultra-violet and at last into the rainbow of colours that are visible to our eyes.‘The Dirac Code’. iγ · ∂ψ =mψTo get the accounting right, Dirac needed to find two quantitties that when multiplied together give zero, whereas each individually squared gives one.Solutoin: Matrixif you multiply two matrices in the order a ×b the answer is not necessarily the same as if you do it in reverse order, b ×a. They can satisfy a2 = 1; b2 = 1. And although a ×b is not zero, neiher is b ×a zero, their sum can be: a × b + b × a = 0. He had been forced to write his theory with simple numbers replaced by matrices that consisted of four columns with four numbers in each.Apparently Einstein could only be satisfied if an electron both had spin and also either positive or negative energy.The top of the ladder corresponds to zero energy, all the rungs below being the possible negative energy states for electrons.In Dirac’s interpretation of the vacuum, if one electron in this sea were missing, it would leave a hole. The absence of a negatively charged electron with energy that is negative relative to sea-level, will appear as a positively charged particle with positive energy, namely with all the attributes of what was later called a positron.PTE Scan:There might be nuclear decays where a proton turned into a neutron, the electric charge being taken away by a positron. Some examples of such nuclei are carbon-11, nitrogen-13, and oxygen-15, which are radioactive forms of common elements in the body and can be used, along with positron emission, to trace bodily functions such as those in the brain. to use sugars that emit positrons. The positrons are immediately annihilated by the ubiquitous electrons in nearby atoms. We can tell where in space the annihilation took place, and hence where the sugar was located, simply by using special cameras to detect the gamma rays that come flying out.Elementary Atom:Although a neutron’s total charges add to zero, their motions produce swirling electric currents and magnetism, which can be sensed by watching how a neutron moves in a magnetic field.Proton and neutron, are themselves made of two varieties of quark. Where the proton has one unit of positive charge, an up quark has ⅔ positive and a down has ⅓ negative. Two ups and one down then make a proton (⅔ + ⅔ −⅓ = 1); two downs and one up add to zero charge (⅔ −⅓ −⅓ = 0), which is a neutron.Add to this pair a third type of quark known as ‘strange’, which has the same electrical charge as a down quark (−⅓) and is effectively identical in all respects except that it is about 20 per cent heavier.Annihilation:If the antiproton approaches the proton relatively slowly, it will be entrapped by the attraction of opposite charges and start to orbit around the proton much as an electron might do in a conventional atom.Initially this orbit will be far away, but the antiproton will lose energy, dropping from outer orbits to inner ones, emitting gamma rays as it does so. The antiproton tumbles into a close-in orbit, and comes within the range of the strong force, which is irresistible for protons and antiprotons. within less than a billionth of a billionth of a second they are gone, leaving gamma rays and pions. the pions, short-lived constructs of a quark and an antiquark, self-destruct, turning into yet more gamma rays, or into electrons, positrons, and ghostly neutrinos, all of which carry away the energy from the annihilation.Cage for Anit-MatterSince antimatter will destroy any material object, it must be kept in a cage without material walls. The solution is to have a vacuum that is better than in outer space with magnetic and electric fields that confine the antiparticles, positrons, or antiprotons, as circulating beams. If the magnetic field is powerful enough, it can steer the electrons in tight circles, trapping them in these orbits where they are unable to cross to the far end of the tube. What Dehmelt did was to change the voltage so that current never flowed, but instead the electrons wandered around for ever in the magnetic field. Nuttie-Nut:- We live in a world of matter, but the vacuum is full of both ‘virtual’ antimatter and ‘virtual’ matter, virtual in the sense that it does not materialize (maybe that should read ‘anti-materialize’) but whose presence can be inferred by its effects on passing particles of matter.- an antiparticle could be regarded as a particle that was travelling backwards in time.- Although electrons are matter and antiprotons are antimatter, they are no danger to one another: electrons are destroyed by their antiparticle, the positron, while the antiproton is at risk only from protons or neutrons.Neutrino:Particles that have mass, which we now know includes the neutrino, can spin either left-or right-handed, and it is possible for interactions with other particles to switch them from one to the other. Whether these ghostly entities follow the ‘left-hand matter, right-hand antimatter’ rule, or whether a neutrino is ‘both’ matter and antimatter, in the sense that a neutrino and its antiparticle are not really distinct objects, is an open question.Majoron - Monsterly Heavy Neutrino, that make Higg's Boson, and make matter more than anti-matter:According to theory the majoron, which is a massive neutral fermion, could radiate energy in the form of a ‘Higgs Boson’ and turn into a neutrino or an antineutrino. what the majorons have contributed. Their deaths gave birth to an imbalance between neutrinos and antineutrinos; it was in the subsequent turmoil, as the myriad particles and antiparticles were hit by the asymmetric mix of neutrinos and antineutrinos, that an excess of quarks over antiquarks emerged.Assymetry of the Universe and Physics Law:1. Neutral kaon, written K0 is a Boson, made from a quark and an anti-quark.2. A quark of the down flavour together with an antiquark of the strange variety form the K0. Interchanging matter and antimatter, so you have a strange quark and a down antiquark, produces the anti-version of the K03. A strange quark is more massive than a down quark but otherwise very much the same. As a result a strange quark can shed some energy and convert into a down quark; likewise an anti-strange one can convert into an antidown.4. If matter and antimatter are symmetric, then the change from K0 to anti-K0 is as likely to happen as the reverse process.5. If you create a beam that is a 50:50 mixture of K0 and its anti-twin, you can compare the mix at their deaths. If you find anything other than 50:50, it’s because either there is an asymmetry in the oscillation,6. However, the long-lived one where the effect is biggest, the decay that leads to a positron being slightly more likely to happen than that giving an electron: out of every two-thousand examples, on the average 1,003 will give a positron and 997 give an electron.7. In our world of matter, when the long-lived K decays into a pion and an electron or positron, it is the positron mode that is the most likely."

I also had no idea what antimatter actually was and I probably still don't really get it, I understand it a little more. The most mind boggling thing I learned was that an atomic explosion spits out a couple % of the available energy while an anti-matter bomb would be 100% and no radiation issues.

I get the impression that a big part of the impetus for writing this book was as a response to everyone getting excited over Antimatter after Dan Brown's novel ""Angels and Demons"" (anyone remember that?). In fact, the last chapter is pretty much dedicated to debunking all of the ""FACTS"" from that book. Part of this seems directed at the US military, which seemed to be considering using Antimatter as a weapon, possibly after having read that book. I think this book's explanation of the theory of relativity finally got through to me, at least in terms of how we can't travel faster than the speed of light:""In Einstein’s theory of relativity the mass of a body gets larger and larger the faster it travels. As it approaches the speed of light, the mass grows extremely fast, making the object ever more resistant to acceleration. Eventually, as one tries to reach the speed of light, the mass becomes inﬁnite. It is thus impossible to accelerate a massive object to the speed of light; the only things that travel at light speed are things with no mass, such as light itself! (p. 28)It is also interesting to see how unique earth really is, in terms of all the perfect elements available in one place, as illustrated by this footnote (p. 115): ""if you selected at random a volume of the universe that is millions of light years in diameter, atomic elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, iron, silver, and gold would be all but absent""Regardless, every time I read about physics I seem to understand marginally more. Maybe after a couple hundred more books I'll get it. I do wonder how out of date this book is, however. Maybe a new edition is in order? Interesting passage about Paul Dirac:""During a lecture at the University of Toronto a member of the audience asked politely ‘I do not understand how you derived that formula on the board’. There was a long silence, and it was only after being prompted by the chairman to give an answer that Dirac responded ‘It was not a question; it was a statement’."" (p.35)The whole section ""Don't shake hands with an Anti-alien"" (p. 110) was fascinating"

The initial pages dealing with Dirac (and the appendix on the ""gammas"") are interesting, and I could say this is a nice pamphlet for the purpose of mispelling fears in those (not few, at the time) that believed the perfect destruction weapon was at hand. Most of the arguments against that are, guess what, about the immense costs in time and energy (we would anyway at most what we put in) of producing reasonable quantities of antimatter, and even then the trouble of storing that amount of antimatter."

The discovery of a remarkable sub atomic world that seemingly does not operate by the same set of natural laws as the visible world has challenged our most basic beliefs on life. Is it really possible that the world operates on two different sets of laws or (as many scientists believe) is there one unifying theory of physics yet to be discovered? What do the sub atomic laws tell us about the big bang or the existence of God? And what of the concept of antimatter - a substance that is utterly annihilated when it comes into contact with matter, in the process releasing nearly unlimited energy?Frank Close has written a brilliant, accessible book that explains the theory behind antimatter, its physical attributes, the history behind how it was discovered, and the experiments that proved its existence. As with much of theoretical physics, there is some heavy duty mathematics behind the discovery of antimatter. But Close has written this book for the layman and does a brilliant job of keeping the high level math in the background. It's there in the appendix if you want to dive into the detail, but it is not necessary to follow the stream of the book or to understand the brilliance of the theoretical physicists who first projected the existence of antimatter. In part, it's clear that the author wrote this book to debunk many of the misunderstandings about antimatter that exist in the modern press or in the minds of the general public. He begins the book by noting that conspiracy theorists have claimed that the U.S. Defense Department is close to producing an antimatter bomb. To some extent, he notes, this kind of thinking is encouraged by the mass popularity of books like Dan Brown's Angels & Demons whose plot is based on the presence of an antimatter bomb under the Vatican. Yet the reality makes this idea impossible. For example, it requires as much energy to produce antimatter as is released in it's annihilation which makes its production unrealistic. Second, based on the world's capacity to produce antimatter (it requires exceptionally large facilities and billion's of dollars of investment with current technology) it would take millions of years to produce sufficient antimatter mass for a bomb. Finally, since antimatter is annihilated when it comes into contact with matter, the ability to store large quantities of antimatter for the periods of time necessary to weaponize it is well beyond the capacity of current technologies. That is the point of the book, but along the way Close does a remarkable job of giving us a layman's understanding of the wonders of the sub-atomic universe and telling us a thrilling tale of the discovery and attributes of antimatter. If you are interested in the science behind an understanding of how our universe works (without the complex mathematics) I would argue that this is among the best books I've ever read. Well done Mr. Close!"
24,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186015-mike-s,4,"This book is packed with information, you'll get a good snapshot of the current thinking about particles, anti-particles, the strong and weak force; a little about quarks, cloud chambers and particle accelerators, collectors, and colliders; and some history about the steps it took to get us here. The book is interesting, it doesn't answer questions like how particles transmit forces, and a book I read on quarks made it seem unlikely that they are the most fundamental particle, making a good case for requiring a whole family of sub=quarks to create them. So if you don't take the book too seriously, but as another step towards a complete understanding which is still quite a ways off, then it is interesting. I can't help but think that in the future they will look back at a lot of the ideas we had and chuckle. For instance, how can photons have energy but not mass, if E=mc^2? Can there be particles with mass but no energy, and particles with energy but no mass? I wouldn't be surprised to see science discover that our observations and measurements break down because we are trying to squeeze higher dimensional events into too few dimensions to comfortably handle them. So I guess for me the book illustrates how much we don't know more than what we do. I have to say that Dirac stood out as the most interesting scientist in the book, but then I read ""The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Quantum Genius"" recently and that was really interesting, if you want to read a good book about Dirac and the people who developed quantum mechanics, not to mention anti-matter, I highly recommend it. It manages to make them seem less like super-men and more like interesting people with interesting quirks, strengths, and weaknesses. "
25,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"Frank Close is Professor of Physics at Oxford University, a Fellow of Exeter College, and has written a number of books, including Lucifer’s Legacy and The Void; so he really knows a thing or two about relativity, quantum theory, and more importantly, antimatter. Close says he wrote the book after a BBC Radio 4 discussion in 2007 that sparked a lot of emails and questions concerning antimatter and its possible power, especially when considered in the hands of the US military or perhaps a terrorist organization. Coupled with this is the new movie of Angels & Demons, based on the Dan Brown book, involving an antimatter bomb secreted beneath the Vatican. In Antimatter Close does his best to dispel this notion of antimatter being something that can be easily made and used for devastation. He takes readers on a history lesson into the discovery of antimatter, as well as explaining how it was physically found from a mathematical point of view. This book is not for those who don’t have a solid grasp of mathematics, otherwise readers will get lost in the jargon and mental loops and whirls. But for those who know math and want some questions answered about this relatively new and certainly misunderstood “matter,” Antimatter is a short and perfect book for this.For more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter."
26,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809206-nick-gotch,5,"If you're into particle physics Frank Close gives you a reading experience well worth the time. Territory like particle and high-energy physics are typically notorious for being mathematically rigorous and dull. Close does an amazing job at actually keeping the reader excited and engaged. He takes a subject as complex and abstract as these and brings them down to a casual, comfortable level. That said, a slight caveat: the book can get technical and people without at least some background in the subject might be overwhelmed.One thing worth noting about Close's style in Antimatter is he likes to work up the imagination with some fantastic ideas shortly before he dissects them with physical principles. This can be a little disappointing on initial read but after some reflection one can appreciate how the hype of urban myths gets warped and spread about. Close is good to point out that the real story of antimatter is wonderfully exciting on its own right and there's no need for the exaggerated hype. And the dissection of the flaws in Angels & Demons is very satisfying.""Antimatter"" is an excellent read for anyone interested in particle/high-energy physics and particularly the strange material known as antimatter. In fact, I enjoyed the read so much, I'm already on to Close's next work, ""Nothing: A Very Short Introduction."""
27,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2466135-leonardo-duenas-osorio,3,"The author provides a compelling narrative on anti-matter from its theoretical predictions by Paul Dirac to the production of anti-hydrogen atoms at CERN. He also spices the book with many of the sagas and rivalries for Nobel prices awarded to physicists, mathematicians and engineers in their sometimes simultaneous quests to identify, measure, create, and store anti-particles. This book is accessible and provides some adequate details on the derivation of Dirac’s equation and the use of matrices to reconcile Einstein’s theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. However, when the author decides to settle some of the myths on anti-matter in the last chapter (Tunguska, weapons, energy, etc.) he becomes repetitive and immature, diminishing the good quality of his contribution. Personally, I enjoyed the discussion on Dirac’s equation, the applications of anti-matter in medical equipment, and a reminder of the many particles that are part of the Standard Model. Also, the discussion on the prevailing hypothesis to explain matter dominance was thought provoking. "
28,0199550166,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7508091-jasim,5,"The book is really Anti boring. It gives an immense knowledge about the sub atomic particles, I would rather say that it’s a WIKI of sub atomic particles, from their discoveries , winning Nobel prize , internal quarrels are mentioned in a short, precise and in a beautiful way. The book gets more attention just thinking “How to keep an Object captured which destroys everything when it comes to its contact”. The working of Cloud Chamber experiment is explained neatly. They also made a trap which captures that object that destroys everything when it comes to its contact and its known PENNING TRAP which uses the electric and magnetic field to keep the Antimatter inside it.  The sentence which admired me the most is “The Laws of Nature Are Not WRONG, Though They Have Turned Out To Be More Subtle Than Any One Expected”. This book is must read for all the physics lovers and student. I recommend this book to those who have more interest in nuclear and particle physics. Have fun……. Happy reading"

The subject matter - antimatter - is one I've been intrigued by for some time, and having read this book I can say that I know much more about it. The concept and the dimensions (size) involved make it very challenging to understand the deeper details of this world we inhabit, but the book was short enough not to make it boring. However, there were many sections where I felt much was being left out or not properly explained. Likely the page count would at least double if to go into more detail, but I didn't enjoy being left with more unanswered questions. There are a few mathematical details involved, but they're mostly in the appendix so that wasn't an issue.I suppose as an introduction to antimatter it served its purpose ok, but I'm looking forward to finding a book which will explain in more detail."

In this case Close give the reader an hearty appreciation for the world of anti-matter while simultaneously debunking the number of apocalyptic scenarios that have been built around it. Another great aspect of the book is that Close does not underestimate the reader intelligence and discusses honestly the unknowns that any new discovery highlights.

I came into this knowing practically nothing about the topic and came away with a working understanding of the importance, uses, and history of Antimatter. The only questions that Close leaves you with are ones that he (or any other scientist) cannot explain as of yet. The book is also impressively well written for a science book, making it easy to understand. My only gripe with this book is that parts of it focus on discounting current ""myths"" instead of just stating the facts and letting the obvious differences from Brown's Angels and Demons to show themselves.

In it include the cosmic question: why did matter win, a discussion about majorana neutrinos, CP violations, and the all important, if aliens came to the earth how could we be sure that they weren't made out of antimatter?
