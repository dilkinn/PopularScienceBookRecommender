0,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"e: The Story of a Number certainly lives up to its title!The book begins with an introduction to logarithms, highlighting the relationship between the arithmetic and geometric progressions contained therein. Then we learn how the enigmatic number e was already slyly peeking out at us, way back in the day, in the realm of compound interest. Next we have a fairly decent discussion of limits and infinity. Then, after some binomial formula gymnastics, which are aided by an obliging infinite series, we see why the limit of (1 + (1/n))^n, a formula related to compound interest, tends to e as n tends to infinity. A slightly more rigorous proof is fortunately included in the appendices, which, among other things, also offer a gorgeous proof of the irrationality of e. Elegant, elegant math.The author briefly discusses the Greeks’ treatment of geometry and area, and then he explores some really fascinating territory: the manner in which the very large (infinites) can be harnessed together with the very small (infinitesimals) to determine the area under a curve. This brings us to e: Grégoire de Saint-Vincent, that brilliant fiend, discovered the formula for the area under a truly stubborn little hyperbola, y = 1/x. The area in question is expressed by the logarithmic function with base e, or the natural log. You’ve just gotta love those logs! :DNext, the whole Newton/Leibniz “I invented calculus first!” bitchfit is covered. We soon discover, through differential calculus, that e is pretty badass. And get this: the exponential function e^x is equal to its own derivative. Kinky! Then a few rather run-of-the-mill physical applications of the function are perfunctorily trotted out. Blah.Now we investigate the natural log function, or the inverse of the exponential function. The logarithmic spiral, or ""spira mirabilis,"" plotted in polar coordinates, is really quite pretty (check out that equiangular property in action!):Next we examine e as it relates to hyperbolic trig functions, and then we get to some good stuff: e^ix and Euler! Included is a simple derivation which shows that e^ix = cos x + i sin x, which thus links the exponential function (of an imaginary variable) to trigonometric functions. Sweet Jesus, how do they think of these things?? (Euler was a legend.) Also, when x = π, we obtain the stunning e^πi + 1 = 0, a formula that connects the five most important constants in mathematics. Now we’re talking! The rest of the book deals with mapping complex functions, complex analysis, polar representations of complex functions, etc. The big star of this section is how ""the imaginary becomes real."" Long story short: Euler managed to determine that i^i = e^-((π/2) + 2kπ), k an integer. Math is weird as hell, I’m telling you. Also, it is pointed out that hyperbolic functions are, like, super well-behaved when they play with purely imaginary variables.Well, that was a long-ass summary! Here are some pros and cons I believe are worth mentioning:Pros: The book does a much better job than most pop science books with its balance of history and actual math—it’s decidedly skewed toward the math! Also, the math in question, while detailed, can still be grasped by those who have studied a bit of calculus at the university level. Cons: The book did not really explore the more interesting real-life applications of e. Also, I had some issues with the organization of the book. For instance, the last chapter looked at different types of numbers (integers, rational versus irrational numbers, and algebraic versus transcendental numbers). It seems to me that this material ought by rights to have been presented in the beginning of the goddamn book! Seriously, I have no idea why he jammed this shit into the conclusion. Yuck city. Bottom line: if you’re keen on math, or really any STEM discipline, this book provides a decidedly comprehensive look at a number that deserves more attention than it usually receives.Also, here’s a final gift from the book I’d like to give anyone still reading. Look at this sexy girl:
""…the number pi, originally defined in connection with the circle, can be expressed in terms of integers alone, albeit through an infinite process.""
 Yes."
1,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"Eli Maor wrote quite a few books about the history of Mathematics. They are wonderful in combining interesting historical insights with the maths per se, but on the level of a school program. I loved his ""Infinity"" book. This is as well extremely erudite and fascinating. e - is irrational number which is the basis of the natural logarithm. Sounds daunting, but one can think of this number as a basis for measuring rate of change in many processes involving so called exponential growth (the rate of growth is proportional to the current state of the system). It is very relevant nowadays while almost everything what matters grows exponentially including information, population, pollution etc.The book is not very technical at all. It explains underlying maths. But also talks about fascinating historical characters and anecdotes. To illustrate, I will just mention here one episode:As the story goes, the Calculus were ""discovered"" in the 17th simultaneously by Newton in England and Leibniz on the continent. Apparently, it was huge unresolved argument who hold the priority over this discovery. The majority of academy in England claimed it was Newton and that Leibniz has stollen his ideas after seeing some of the Newton's papers. This was severely rejected by the Leibniz's defenders on the continent. Nevertheless, Leibnitz's system of notation was more intuitive and easier to understand and apply.""Knowledge of the calculus has become the dominating mathematical topic of the 18th century and quickly spread throughout the Continent. In England, where it originated, the calculus fared less well. Newton's towering figure discouraged British mathematicians from pursuing the subject with vigor. Worse, by siding completely with Newton in the priority dispute, they cut themselves off from developments on the Continent. The stubbornly stuck to Newton's dot notation, failing to see the advantages of Leibniz's differential notation. As a result, over the next hundred years, while mathematics flourished in Europe as never before, England did not produce a single first-rate mathematician. ""It is so true that history does not teach people any lessons; does it?"
2,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2554312-bill-ward,4,"Everyone knows about π, the ratio 3.14159... the universal constant governing circles. The constant e is just as important if not more so, but never managed to break its way into popular culture because it's a little hard to understand just what makes it so special. This book makes a valiant effort to redress that shortcoming, by explaining the history of logarithms and calculus and how the last 400 years of mathematics developed, empowered largely by this mysterious number which, before the invention of computers and calculators, was critical in doing any kind of serious arithmetic. Nowadays they don't even teach how logarithms are used to do multiplication - I'm 40 years old, and it was not taught when I was a kid either - but for hundreds of years the only realistic way to do it was to look up the numbers in a log table, add them up, look the sum up in another table, and get your result.This book talks about the lives of mathematicians and their discoveries, and how those built on each other to produce the knowledge we now have about the amazing world of numbers. But books like this tend to have a fatal flaw, either dumbing down the math so much that it becomes basically just biography and handwaving, or having so much math that you need an advanced math degree to understand it. This one strikes a very careful balance between those extremes. There were definitely parts where I had to stretch my brain back 20 years to high school and college calculus classes, but each of the formulas was pretty well explained, and I'd like to think you could come away from this book with some understanding even if you'd never taken any advanced math."
3,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25094561-elijah-oyekunle,5,"I love this concise history of one of Mathematics' most interesting numbers. e is usually dominated by pi in mathematical history, but e also has an interesting story behind it. Calculus was required to explain and understand it, which brought the Bernoullis, Leibnitz, Newton, Euler and a lot of other scientific geniuses to tackle it.Unlike pi, which has been known for thousands of years, and which was foundational to geometry, one of Mathematics' oldest branches, e has been around for a shorter period of time (about 400 years), and deals with a bunch of things like irrationality, infinity and stuff that ancient mathematicians never liked to think much about.I always find interesting the story of Hippasus, a Pythagorean who is famous for getting drowned by other Pythagoreans for his threat to expose irrationality.Although a lot of stuff in the book was over my head and I steadily refused the urge to read the Appendices, I still think this book is a good work of mathematical history."
4,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1929917-andy,2,"One hundred and thirty pages into Eli Maor’s history of Euler’s number (e), Maor experiences what can only be described as a ""John Nash moment"". Here he departs from his straight-laced account to describe, at length, an imagined conversation between J. S. Bach and Johann Bernoulli.Bernoulli: That perfectly fits my love for orderly sequences of numbers.Bach: But there is a problem. A scale constructed from these ratios consists of three basic intervals: 9:8, 10:9, and 16:15. The first two are nearly identical, and each is called a whole tone, or a second… But the same ratios should hold regardless of which note we start from. Every major scale consists of the same sequence of intervals.Bernoulli: I can see the confusion…This bizarre interlude aside, Maor has a difficult time keeping to the project he outlines in his introduction. Maor says he hope his book will live up to Beckmann’s A History of ∏, which he describes as model of clarity and accessibility. Unfortunately, e doesn’t lend itself easily to non-mathematical description. After a brief and entertaining history of logarithms, as Maor begins his approach to the subject at hand, his text quickly becomes mired in equations—limits, infinite series, and calculus notation.Readers equipped with some basic grounding in calculus will certainly be able to trudge through Maor’s book, and along with the history, Maor touches on many interesting applications of e—to such diverse fields as finance, number theory, physics, and architecture. All in all, though, Maor’s book is a rather whimsical attempt at a history of e, certainly nothing that will satisfy either armchair or academically-minded mathematicians."
5,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1006205-jeffrey,4,"OK, so books on math, not going to become national best sellers by any stretch of the imagination. But any story in the field of math be it zero, 'e,' Phi, PI tells us more about that mystical, insightful language that can tell us so much about the why's and what's of our surroundings, as well as provide the more practical to suit our human needs. Math is interesting in the sense that it dictates to the mathematician not the mathematician to it to determine outcome. ie: in string theory, the math tells the mathematician that not only is a fourth dimension needed but up to a seventh. So, to the book. Maor has done a great job giving us some background on 'e' and its beginnings in logarithmic use. And even though 'e's use can be found in diverse places--""the interest earned in a bank account, the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower, and the shape of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis""--its significance, only second to PI in importance, as a number is greatly and clearly expressed by Maor. It's written for the non-mathematician, no great depth of understanding needed to get the points here. Some anecdotes and diversions to bring home points made. Good effort. "
6,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983981-ben-pace,2,"Enjoyable skim through the basics of logarithms, conic sections, calculus, and various other areas of mathematics relating to e. Not a textbook, so don't read this to learn those subjects, only to glance at them. The historical aspects add a narrative element, and of course the writing is far more pleasant than a textbook too. The background given, and also the original explanations, helped me to understand some of the concepts better, so I am glad that I read it. I will only be giving it a cursory glance though.(Subject to edit on completion)"
7,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91560761-stanley-xue,4,"Great book to explore mathematics from a different perspective (recreational rather than traditional mathematics education). Even suitable if you haven't touched and been learning more maths for a while. Many of the explanations were built from first principles. Although there was a lot of overlap initially with mathematics covered in high school cirricula (e.g. logarithms, compound interest formula, limits & Zeno's paradox, differentiation from first principles, binomial theorem/Pascal's triangle, differentiation and integration). Similarly to An Imaginary Tale, this subject matter was approached in a chronological manner, with stories about the characters and mathematicians involved in the story of e. This improved the ease of the read and helped maintan my interest in combination with other general trivial facts and case studies e.g. the story of the Bernoulli family, the tables of logarithms.There was ample new subject matter especially in the latter half of the book for me (stuff that wasn't covered in high school, wasn't proven and accepted as fact, or just forgotten by me): spira mirabillis, squaring of the hyperbola (proof for area under hyperbola without use of calculus), hyperbolic functions, mapping of complex functions etc. It was especially satisfying to read about the relationship between e and pi (e.g. Euler's formula); as well as e appearing in the Prime Number Theorem; AND THAT YOU CAN EVALUATE LOGARITHMS OF NEGATIVE NUMBERS (explanation also in An Imaginary Tale (below)). Would recommend reading in conjunction with An Imaginary Tale (a book about the imaginary number: i) - although the material of the latter seems to be more advanced. Having only read that book a month ago, I seem to have forgotten some of the theorems and proofs within. As such, this book was great to remind me of those theorems and the beauty of their proofs. (NB: some overlap in the content of the book e.g. Euler's thoerem, Laplace's equations, hyperbolic functions).Maybe I wish that there was more maths in this book. Some proofs seem to be glossed over and ""outside the scope of this book"". Some of the explanations seem less clear than those within An Imaginary Tale. Maybe this is why I rate this book 4 starts instead of 5. (As well since the novelty of a book (that is not a textbook) fiddling with a lot of maths has been attenuated for me). I do wish there were more math equations/proofs rather than maths mixed in with wordy explanations. Although I'm not sure which one I retain better since it seems that a lot of the proofs and examples in An Imaginary Tale have already been lost on me. "
8,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349312-andrew-y,5,"As said by others - picked this up wanting to understand a complex mathematical topic, got this and also an awesome historical overview of the development of the calculus and more over hundreds of years. Awesome!"
9,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46092811-jennifer,2,"Too. Much. Calculus. I was hoping this would be more like The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number, but it wasn't. For one thing, this book has differential equations. A lot of them. As a STEM major, I did study calculus at the university level (but not Dif Eq), but this was still hard going. What really helped get me through the book were the historical anecdotes, and the parts of the book I was able to follow well were also well-done."
10,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2057893-tim,4,"Maor's account of the place of e, the base of the natural logarithms, in the history of mathematics provides a peek inside a mathematician's brain. More connected by mathematical ideas than by chronology or the usual social, cultural, economic, or political themes taken up by historians, Maor's book opened vistas in the calculus I did not see when I first ploddingly confronted derivatives and integrals some decades ago. He thoroughly covers the differing views of Newton and Leibniz as they developed the calculus. He discusses some of the special characteristics of e revealed in the fact that the exponential function is its own derivative. He shows how e appeared in nature and the arts - musical scales, the spiral mirablis, a hanging chain, the parabolic arc of a projectile, the Gateway Arch. More than other of recent books focused on a particular number, Maor explores the mathematics of e with a mathematician's interest. But metaphysics creeps in as it seems to in discursive accounts of mathematical developments and achievements. Numbers - in particular special numbers like e - have been imbued with mystical connections to larger or hidden things. This account of e raises the questions again, ""What is this language of numbers that humans have developed and how is this language linked to the world 'out there'?"" In one sense, the number e, like its more famous companion pi, turns out to be not only an irrational number but also non-algebraic - not a solution (root) of a polynomial equation. Such numbers are called transcendental, meaning merely 'beyond algebraic'. In the end, Maor's story of e is an account of human activity in a world of patterns. And it is an excellent companion to a course in calculus."
11,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,2,"Like its more famous cousin pi, e is an irrational number that shows up in unexpected places all over mathematics. It also has a much more recent history, not appearing on the scene until the 16th century. My favorite parts of this book were the historical anecdotes such as the competitive Bernoullis and the Nerwton-Leibniz cross-Channel calculus feud. Unfortunately, this math history text is much heavier on the math than the history, including detailed descriptions of limits, derivatives, integrals, and imaginary numbers. The trouble with this large number of equationsis that if you’re already familiar with the concepts you’ll be doing a lot of skimming, but if the subject is confusing then reading this book will probably not give you any new insights. In short, as much as I normally enjoy books about math and science, this particular one felt too much like a textbook. Recommended only for those folks with a very strong love for the calculus and related topics."
12,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21445480-aakash-subhankar-bhowmick,5,"The book takes you through an amazing journey of time in which you will be fascinated and humbled by the efforts which mathematician have put in to develop mathematics as it is today. The book is perfect to arouse interest in mathematics in your children, and to make them realize that more than its regular textbook form, mathematics is fun, inspiring and beautiful."
13,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6705357-dan,1,"Maor did not do a good job at staying remotely on-topic. This would be better advertised as a history of calculus, as more time was devoted to that than to e. While the historical content of the book is certainly fascinating, it is not what I signed up for when I started reading."
14,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,1,"I found this basically unreadable. It oscillated too quickly between ""history"" and ""refresher of AP calculus"" and lacked any real unifying themes. It felt very rambly. The author has a lot of facts more or less related to logarithms, or exponentials, or infinite series, and wants to share them all."
15,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43532248-swhite,4,"This is a fairly straightforward book, doing essentially what it set out to do. It gives you a history of how *e* came to be and shows you how it became increasingly important in mathematics. The one interesting wrinkle is the author's view of the Newton & Leibniz, where the author clearly takes a pro Leibniz stand. Having read other books by other authors with a distinctly different tone, I found the author's opinions troubling. For one, the author seemed to be somewhat dismissive of physics and other applied aspects of math. For example, the author says, in so many words, that Newton's syntax and approach were polluted by the real world applications to which it was applied, while Leibniz approached calculus with the eye of a true mathematician. And the one thing the book really has trouble explaining is why Leibniz died somewhat in obscurity while Newton was given great honors. Both had equal numbers of defenders and detractors. Why were Germany and France not honoring Leibniz and giving him accolades? The answer is that the author left out critical pieces of information and let his bias for mathematics against applied sciences warp his view of the players.One accusation the author makes is that England essentially went into a temporary dark period for the development of mathematics until the 1830s because of their unwillingness to adopt the superior notation and reasoning made by Leibniz. But did that slow the advancement of physics, chemistry, engineering, mechanics in England? Leibniz was a giant of mathematics and probably better at the theoretical aspects of Calculus, but Newton had F = ma and history rightfully judges Newton the giant and Leibniz a far behind runner up. Also, though Leibniz wrote the superior Calculus textbook with superior insight and syntax, Newton was far better at actually solving challenging math problems with real world implications. And finally, though I believe Leibniz should get equal claim for developing Calculus and I disagree with those who wish to give majority credit to Newton, Leibniz and his supporters used dishonest methods, such as back dating documents, to make their case. They also wrote anonymous scurilious attacks which they denied they wrote and then were later found out to have actually written. Or to put it another way, Leibniz and his defenders behaved in ways that were perceived by others to be dishonorable.There is one interesting subtext that the author does not really go into as well. In later years, Leibniz and Newton did make up to a certain extent and acknowledged each others roles as being vital. The real controversies started when Leibniz and Newton had gotten quite old and the dispute was taken up by other players. Then the controversy had more to do with politics than any real interest to determining who was responsible for what."
16,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96227065-guardingnome,5,"I can trace all of my interest, and success, in mathematics back to this book. I read it at a far too young age, and harassed my friends with my otherworldly knowledge of numbers and mathematics for years.Eli Maor is extremely capable at distilling complex concepts into simple and intuitive explanations, and weaving the human nature of discovery into the story of this number.e, the number, is visible so much in the world around us, and this book does an excellent job at explaining the significance and peculiarity of this relation.I cannot stress enough that this book should not be passed up, especially by curious children."
17,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8028326-david,5,Absolutely brilliant. Among my favorite books. It has everything---from the infamous Newton/Leibniz controversy and the first derivation of Euler's constant from compound-interest calculations to the rectification of the logarithmic spiral and the Cauchy-Riemann equations for (complex) analytic functions. The appendix alone is nearly worth the price of the book. A true gem. Riveting and well written. Essential reading. 
18,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3269664-matt,3,"This book is, I think, as good as it could be given its dry subject matter. The histotical portion of the book was well written and well researched, but it's not a page-turner. The math was well explained, although, I think you had better understand calculus to get much out of it. In his preface, Maor's stated goal is for the book to be ""accessible to readers with only a modest background in mathematics"". In that, I think he falls well short."
19,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272430-daniel,3,"Interesting enough. Best thing about the book IMO is the appendix that offers proofs for the existence of the number in its earliest form (i.e., limit of (1+1/n)^n). I always find the typical discussions of e or of that limit to be circular, so it's nice to have a from-scratch defense of the number!"

I was mainly reading it to see if it would be appropriate for teaching in a seminar-style course to get students interested in mathematics; maybe it would work for that purpose, but it probably would be best read by students already fairly interested in mathematics. A minor criticism I have is that the author is too taken by musical theory for my tastes, going so far as to create a fictional conversation between Bach and a Bernoulli. "

For many of those people, the math in this book might be a bit intimidating. If it discourages them from picking up this book, that would be unfortunate, because the author does a pretty good job of explaining the history of the math that involves the use of e and its importance in solving a number of difficult problems.I encountered most of the math in this book in college as I pursued my engineering degree, so I was able to follow along pretty easily. But even without a full understanding of the formulas, the history described here is pretty fascinating, and was mostly new to me. While you hear the names when they teach the math, it is rare that you are told the stories of the people who lent their names to the various formulas and concepts. It is fascinating to see how the solutions we take for granted were discovered and how the various developments build upon each other.Those who find math and science interesting will certainly appreciate this book. Others may struggle to understand parts of it, but still should find some of the history of interest."
37,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8223441-moctar-bebaha,5,"This books is certainly one of the best books on the history of Math, Mathematicians, and numbers. Although from the title of the book it seems that the book only concerns exponentials and logarithms, the fact is the author takes you from the first attempts of humans to understand numbers and their nature, to the discovery of irrational numbers and, later on, to transcendental numbers, the creation of imaginary numbers and the struggle to ""make peace"" with them. The author beautifully introduces all the great names of Math and science throughout history to the reader, he beautifully builds the connection between their lives and the work they've undetake in the development of mathematics to what we know today. the illustrations and appendices in the book are very helpful and the simple approach the author takes to explain the problems at the origin of the discoveries is outstanding. one needs a basic background in mathematics to read the book, and also should be familiar with most of the formula involving logarithms, exponentials and periodic function. complex numbers too.I definitely recommend this book to anybody interested in history of math and science."
38,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"This book surprised me a bit by being more of an actual maths book (ie. not just a maths history / popularisation book) than I expected. Having said that, it stayed mainly on the right side of the line for me and I could skate over it without much impact in those places where the maths got a bit more technical than I wanted to bother with. And it was good to be reminded what actual maths is about in a way that wasn't too disconcerting. The maths in the book is followable to anyone with A-level standard, although some of the subjects (eg. complex analysis) are things you'd only cover in a degree course. I liked the attempts to get under the skin of some of the maths and examine, for example, the ways in which e is analogous to pi. Perhaps the hyperbolic functions were explained that way to me when I learned about them at school, but the exposition here was definitely illuminating. Worth a read if you want to skip the actual maths for the historical and big picture stuff, and even more useful if you don't mind ploughing through the maths for a deeper understanding."
39,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"A good book from Eli Maor. Nearly rated 4 stars but I'm a bit of a meanie. The book is a nice mixture of history / biography and mathematics. Rather more actual mathematics than is usual for this type of book but it's well presented and, of course, the reader can skip the bits of maths wherever s/he gets bored of them (I did, quite a lot!) The author writes really well and the text is a joy to read.For my part I would have liked more of the history / biography stuff and a little less of the mathematical proofs. I was also left with the faint impression that there were reasons why some of the amazing facts about e, the exponential function and the logarithmic function were true, but that the book didn't quite manage to elucidate them - just demonstrating them as amazing peculiarities. Of course, a proper mathematician would reject my sensation and tell me that there is no ""why"", there's just ""is"", and that the proofs themselves are all the ""why"" that can be provided, but then that (and a lack of ability) is why I gave up maths :-)Good book, well worth a read."
40,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898019-vernon,4,"I recently gave a speech in my Toastmasters club titled ""The Power of e."" I have always had a little place in my heart for this irrational, transcendental number. This speech gave me the chance to talk about the origins of e and where we can find evidence of it in our lives. After the speech, one of the club members told me about this book. I checked it out and really quite enjoyed reading it.It is not a really light read, but it is easy enough for anyone who has studied calculus to understand. Maor does not go into the nitty gritty of all the proofs he mentions and gives some very useful examples. The figures are also very helpful. It has been many years since I have done much with calculus so much of the material had to get dredged up from my secondary storage location in my brain. It is really a history of mathematics and science that spirals around e, which is exactly what the title would infer. Well written and a fun read."
41,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47621876-braden-weber,4,"I would've liked this book much more if it actually fulfilled its claims. ""Designed for a reader with only a modest background in mathematics.""""This biography of e brings out that number's central importance in mathematics""Neither seemed to apply to the book I was reading. It was as challenging as any math book I've ever read, and the tangents -- either I'm too stupid to understand how the tangents tie into e, or they actually don't tie into e. Neither should be true because a) it's a book about e and b) it's supposed to be for people of modest mathematical backgrounds. I will admit, however, that I've never taken calculus, so I might've understood 90% more if I had just waited a year to read it. Too late now.But all that aside, I can't stay angry for long. Math has always been a passion of mine, and even a book like this helps to open up the world in my eyes. So I'm giving it 4 stars, not because it was everything I wanted, but because math is awesome."
42,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4698893-brent-neal,4,"Maor's treatise on the history of the Naperian base is an simple, interesting read beginning with a short biography of Napier himself. As is customary with any history of science or math of that time, Maor provides the reader with an obligatory look into the infamous conflict between Newton and Leibniz. While the history itself was not terribly new to me, my attention and delight was found in Maor's very instructive sidebars demonstrating applications, including the logarithmic spiral in art and the Weber-Fechner law. While I don't think that one has to be fully conversant in calculus to enjoy this book, some awareness of math may be necessary to fully grasp everything that Maor offers. For myself, I found it to be perfect light reading for those occasions when the mind needs diversion without fluff."
43,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42010300-kristina-brown,3,"Despite being described as accesible to readers with 'only a modest background in mathematics', the equations depicted are fairly complicated. Whether because the workings of logarithms with a slide rule is now obsolete, or because I haven't studied math for several years, I found the proofs and explanations difficult to get my head round.However all this was interspersed with chapters on the major figures in mathematical history, and a sequential description of it's advancement, which was interesting. Some parts were even amusing and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in mathematics."
44,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2251491-ringthebells,3,"This one didn't really work for me. It wasn't really readable as a story -- the math was too dense, the narrative too thin. On the other hand, there wasn't much math that I didn't already know from teaching first-year calculus a bunch of times.Still, it was interesting reading Maor's summary of the whole Newton/Liebniz kerfuffle (of course I knew there had been one, but I'd never read about it in detail before). And it was neat seeing how Newton's notation worked. Plus, the stuff about the invention of logarithms was cool."
45,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1776553-mark-schomburg,4,"It's a great telling of mathematical history, and I wish this kind of material were more known in undergraduate calculus circles - just to set a context for what is otherwise arcane formulation without end. We learn here the tale of the ""calculus"" between Newton and Leibniz, and much, much more in terms of what developments set the stage for e to appear. The text does not shy away from using mathematical language and formulas which would be expected of a student of this subject. Highly recommended! "
46,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246265-nick,4,"In this book we learn about e, a number closely connected to Calculus. In order to understand e, you must understand Calculus. The author explains the subject in the booka at various points.I last Calculus class I had was in June of last year. Although it was a fair review for some topics, I couldn't say I understood everything explained or learned anything new. For an author trying to each a standard audience I don't think he did well.I did find the historical sections of the book interesting."
47,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038792-rick,5,"I wish new concepts were introduced this way by teachers. They typically race through a derivation and then spend time on what ""really matters"", i.e., being able to correctly answer test questions. Here we learn the mystery of why anybody would even derive such a strange number and then find it appearing all over the place. That's what I like about math anyway: something begins as a purely abstract discovery and then turns out to have more practical significance than anybody could have imagined."
48,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3285557-louis,5,"If you can handle the math, this is a fun book about Napier's important number. Although it is not in the Kaplan method of math tomes, with a lot of cultural background and personality profiles of the key players, it does have some on the way to explaining the topics. Yes, there are problems to follow and formulas to understand. They don't particularly hang together in an ongoing story, but they are informative. This would be a good book for a high school senior who is good at math and might enjoy a more broad background to calculus than his high school course."
49,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/668250-jessica,3,"I liked this better than many of the math-themed books I've read, but I think that's because I've been so much more involved in math since I started teaching. There's so much I'd forgotten about, but now that I'm teaching it, I understand these books a lot better. I really liked the way this book explained logarithms, and I liked all the historical tidbits. Definitely not for non-mathematicians though."
50,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1007053-paul-de-barros,4,"There is a great deal of fascinating historical information in this book. I recommend it in particular to anyone who has just taken calculus, or remembers it fairly well. A knowledge of calculus is not necessary to enjoy the book, but those who are acquainted with the subject will appreciate some of the mathematics more. This book is not for those who dislike mathematics or don't remember high school math at all."
51,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"A impressively thorough discussion of the role of 'e' in mathematics. I liked that the content was a bit more mathematically-grounded than most pop-math books, without ever getting dense. The variety of content is pretty remarkable. My only complaint was that some of the content relates to 'e' in only a roundabout manner and could have been done away with (for instance, there's a bit too much emphasis on the rational for and history of calculus)."
52,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,4,"This book talks more about the history of math than it does specifically about the number e, but that was just fine with me. The downside, though, was how inadequate it made me feel at times. Once upon a time, I knew smart(ish) math things, but it's been so long, that I've forgotten most of it! Argh!"
53,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575757-ilya,4,really well presented overview of how we came to learn about and appreciate e. some highlights:* history of logarithms* description of bernoulli's logarithmic spiral - showing how the spiral can be used to represent musical notes* explanation of hyperbolic sines and cosinesi wish the book had gone into a little more detail about the relationship of e with complex numbers. 
54,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3706682-greg-howard,3,"This book was a goodbye gift from a job I had two years ago, so it's good that I finally finished it. If you find the premise of this book enticing, you'll probably enjoy it. There's a good mix of math (fairly basic to anyone that majored in math) and math history, so it stays engaging throughout."
55,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17009470-bob-woodley,5,"An enjoyable trip through the history of e, i, pi, natural logs, musical harmonics, the Bernoulli family, integrating the hyperbola and the life of Euler. The history of math is a great way to tie together all the threads that were taught to as separately in school. And by the way, we were rarely taught the history of math, which is the fun bit it turns out."

The author says that the math in the book is not complicated and can be understood by anyone with a modest knowledge of math. Well, forget that if you are mathematically challenged as I am. But it is easy to skip/skim the math parts that are above your level and still find the book fascinating."
58,0691058547,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653451-ajp3,5,"great little book about the number e. the mathematics is not complicated, but must be understood to fully enjoy this book. lots of insight here, should be required of all trigonometry/algebra/calculus students.
