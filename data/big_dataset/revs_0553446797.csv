As a Scientist my teacher talked a lot about Rosalind Franklin, and how her data was key to the double helix model. But she was never credited for her work, And i'm glad that the truth got out, and everyone now knows that it was a team work, Not just Watson and Crick. my teacher also talked a lot about Barbara mCclintock, and how she was treated and isolated but she made a major breakthrough when she discovered transposition and used it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for changing corn's color (phenotype). i learned about the rest of these strong, successful women from this book."
1,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233482-kevin-mcallister,3,"While there's no doubt that all 52 of the amazing woman covered in this book are more than deserving of recognition (I've never heard of most of them) there is the matter of quality over quantity. Each of these woman's achievements we're covered in about two or three pages and they all left me wanting more. I couldn't help but feel this book would have been a more enjoyable reading experience if the author had narrowed down the selection to a round number, of lets say 10. And then dedicated more time to flesh out and further discuss how they were able to change science and the world deposit all the obstacles placed in their way."
2,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,4,"The premise of this book is basically the best. It was written in response to Yvonne Brill's obituary in the New York Times in March 2013, which honored her not for being an actual rocket scientist, but for her ""mean beef stroganoff."" After the public outcry, the Times amended the obituary—which, along with this book, is the perfect example of how social media can be worthwhile. This absurd thing happened, and even though it's been happening for decades and centuries, the fact that we're all connected online means that now we can do something about it. Women said ""excuse us, this is stupid,"" and the newspaper changed what it printed. Rachel Swaby said ""excuse me, this is stupid,"" and wrote this book about all the women we didn't know because that same stupid thing probably happened to them. There are women in medicine, genetics, engineering, physics, astronomy, mathematics, and biology. There are inventors and environmentalists. There are the names we already know—Sally Ride, Rachel Carson, Hedy Lamarr, Ada Lovelace, Florence Nightingale—but mostly there are names I'd never heard of. Inge Lehmann discovered Earth's inner core; Annie Jump Cannon classified hundreds of thousands of stars; Helen Taussig revolutionized heart surgery. Alice Ball was a black woman in her early twenties who found a way to treat leprosy. Chien-Shiung Wu disproved what had been thought to be a fundamental law of physics. Each of these women gets only three or four pages, but their determination, intelligence, and significant contributions are conveyed clearly. Most of them sound like people I would love to have known personally (like Rosalyn Sussman Yalow, who hung from the rafters to see Enrico Fermi speak when she was in college). This is a book that should be studied in schools. The information is concise, and their careers are summarized with a sense for their overall impact on their fields. Nowhere else do you see so clearly how women have been ignored and excluded from STEM history, but this book draws attention to and rights that wrong all at once."
3,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,4,"Can you name any women scientists? Okay, Marie Curie, that's good. Anyone else? While I might have been able to come up with a few (Rosalind Franklin, Irene Joliot-Curie), the names wouldn't spring to mind as easily as I would like. Now that I've read Headstrong, I'll have no trouble coming up with a dozen or more off the top of my head. The best way to remember things is to connect a story to it. Here are 52 short stories of a few pages each, and you'll definitely remember at least a few of them.Author Rachel Swaby summarizes the accomplishments of each of these women and tells something of the challenges they overcame or how they became scientists. A common thread is the quirky nature of most of the women. They seemed to care less than most of us about what others thought of them. They didn't do as they were told and charged ahead, swatting aside obstacles. Headstrong, indeed.While I enjoyed reading these thumbnail biographies, I found Swaby's informal style a tiny bit odd at times: ""...MIT put the kibosh on her progress."" ""...made sure Heezen, who was tenured, had a wicked hard time carrying out his work."" For anyone who wants more information than the quick bios here, Swaby has provided a bibliography for each scientist. Since she only has room here to scratch the surface, she has thoughtfully pointed us in the right direction to find out more about these fascinating women."
4,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,5,"After recently reading a book with a very similar scope, but made for kids, I wanted something a little more adult on the subject of women in the STEM fields. This fit the bill. Swaby's book is a primer for the topic with which to discover some of the lesser-known but very important women of the world, and a great jumping-off point from which to learn more elsewhere. Because of Headstrong I'm going to seek out full bios of some of these fascinating people. "
5,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4057501-karissa,3,"I got this book to review through the Amazon Vine program. This book goes through quick profiles of 52 women who had large contributions to science. The women are divided into different areas of science by the science they contributed to (physics, math, earth and stars, medicine, etc). This is a decent book. My biggest complaints are that the sections on each woman are so brief that just as you are getting interesting in that woman the section ends. It only gives you a very brief look into their lives.Also the sections are a bit sloppy...some start at the beginning of the woman's life, some at the end. It would have been nice to have a bit more format to each section.Additionally I would have loved to see a few pictures in here. Of the women themselves or of the work they did...this would have really enhanced this book quite a bit. As is the book is a bit dry and it’s hard to engage in.Overall it's a good book but not a great book. I enjoyed learning about these fascinating women but wish the sections had been more consistent, had some pictures, and had a bit more detail. There aren't a lot of books available give an overview of women in science, so it was nice to see this one come out. I would recommend if you are interested in learning more about influential women in science."
6,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,4,"This book is about 52 women who did have an impact on our lives, and what saddened me is that I didn't know the majority of them..Few pages for mini biographies, the idea is awesome, some readers said the author should have narrowed the number to 10 or less and spoke more of these ten, but no, I love the fact that 52 women were mentionned, you get to know a little about them, their fights, struggles and passion, this will tease your curiosity to find out more, leading you to more books and a whole new load of information and inspiration :)"
7,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35928172-kristina,4,"This lovely little collection does a fantastic job of providing brief, comprehensive summaries of brilliant female scientists, many of whom are virtually unknown. These admirable ladies are grouped by their scientific specialties and each is lauded for her accomplishments as well as her quirks and originality. Overall, Headstrong is an inspiring book that provides a wonderful starting point for exploring the lives of women who have shaped scientific history (mostly anonymously) for four centuries."
8,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,3,"I'll start by saying my science knowledge and background is limited. Headstrong provided an easy-to-read, brief overview of 52 women who contributed to science in one way or another. I had heard of some of the women before but there were many I had not.The book is divided into sections: Medicine, Biology and the Environment, Genetics and Development, Physics, Earth and Stars, Math and Technology, and Invention. I personally found the invention and biology sections to be most interesting, but as with any book that covers multiple topics, this likely varies from person to person. It was disappointing, although no big secret, to read how often the women were dismissed strictly on the basis of gender. Their scientific contributions were frequently downplayed or accredited to men, and many were not rightfully recognized until after they'd died. Some of these women were denied titles, offices, and raises (or any pay in a few instances) at research universities or did not receive proper acceptance as students. Good thing women, as always, continued to persevere anyway :) I read a few reviews prior to reading Headstrong myself, where readers shared they felt the profiles were too short, and just as they were getting into it, the profile would end. I agree with this, in some instances but also acknowledge 52 is not a small number. Headstrong is good for providing a brief overview and could also serve as a decent source for identifying what scientific subjects you'd want to learn more about - then selecting other books to delve into said subjects further. "
9,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18529932-amanda,5,"I'd probably knock off half a star for some of the writers literary choices (I swear, there was a line that was like, ""He made her career there wicked hard"", and a lot of time the tone dropped into slang, which isn't a bad choice on it's own, but it didn't fit the tone of the rest of the book), but to be honest, I have pretty low standards when it comes to books about women in science.You know, because it's freaking hard to find them, and when you do, it's even harder to find books about women in science that aren't like ""Look at this one woman, who is special, and not like other women, so she could do math and science!"" So, basically, I'd be hard pressed to rate this book anything other than five stars. To be fair, this is a pretty decent book. It's very hard to fit any of the accomplishments of any of the women selected into three to five pages, and sometimes clarity suffers. Because each chapter generally covers a different time period (but not always) part of the synopsis always ended up being dedicated to the challenges of the time, which could get repetitive if you had three women from roughly the same time period in a row. I'm hoping this book does well enough that we get a second one done, with women who are currently alive. Also, I want a mixture those two books, redone as a children's book. "
10,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/946659-andi,5,"Rachel Swaby has written brief biographies of 52 amazing women. While no biography is more than 5 or 6 pages, it is just enough information and background to bring these women out of the shadows and peak my curiosity to find out more about their backgrounds and achievements with further research and reading.The only thing that I didn't like about this book is that there exists a need for a book such as this. I have read about many of the men mentioned in this book (mostly in the Physics section) but not many of the women were ever mentioned alongside those men, and that is a serious problem. To read about so many women who had credit stolen from them by their male colleagues or who were refused education and or pay for their work is infuriating. "
11,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35291599-brenda-hoffman,5,"I just started reading the ARC, and it is written very well. In the first hour, I have already read three chapters, and find myself researching more about these women of science. There are some universal themes that emerge about determination, skill, and collaboration. I could see this book on library shelves or having students research further. "
12,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"Yes, yes, yes. More like this please. Short bios about women in science. Only a page or two each, but they give you just enough information. Some women I'd heard of, some I hadn't. Some it's made me want to learn more about. My overwhelming conclusion was that many really great women have really been shit on by men in the past. Here's to moving forward together. "
13,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63612882-crazytourists-books,5,"Wow! 52 amazing, extraordinary women that not only did they change science (and the world) but also cleared the path for the generations that followed. Some of them I knew, some of them I didn't, but they all are role models to look up to, no matter your professional or life aspirations."
14,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"This is a wonderful little book, an introduction to 52 brilliant, driven scientists who fought great odds to do what they loved and get recognition for it. Some reviewers are critical of the fact that the literary quality is not consistently great and the pieces so short there is a ""quantity over quality"" problem. I can see where they are coming from. On the other hand, I find the book fascinating, edifying and very skillfully put together. I love hearing (listening to the audiobook) short piece after short piece in which the scientists' careers and to some degree life stories are compactly and richly rendered.The book is broken up into seven sections. Medicine, Biology and the Environment, Genetics and Development, Physics, Earth and Stars (disappointed Caroline Herschel isn't in here), Math and Technology, Invention and covers scientists who lived between the 1600s and the present.One thing I thought was interesting was the way each biography starts off with, under the scientists' name, their area of study and nationality. But several of the women are Jewish refugees during WWII and I wonder if they would identify themselves with their country of birth in such a brief and simple way. And I'm sure this issue comes up with others as well. (I haven't finished the book. Only about half way through. But so excited about it wanted to write at least a preliminary review.) Just got me thinking about the complications of identity as it relates to place and other cultural locations.Speaking of location and identity, I'm about to listen to the section about Lynn Margulis who is from the area where I'm currently residing. I believe she's most famous for her Gaia theory/theories of symbiosis."
15,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"So many wonderful women in science. I am thankful for Rachel Swaby for bringing them to society's awareness. I have heard better versions of some of these histories, but have never heard them compiled together in a book like this, which really highlights the accomplishments of women, despite all they had to overcome to force their way into education and the sciences. Further, even though I was aware of many women in the book, because I love the history of science, there were still some new biographies for me to enjoy.I often had to stop reading to reflect on how much they suffered and how hard they worked some that women today could get an education and have an easier time entering science related professions. The story of Mary Taussig was my favorite. Rejected by Harvard and other universities, she persevered only to change the face of medicine. Babies born with heart defects died. There was not a whole lot that could be done. But Taussig changed all that. She is my new hero. My favorite part of the book was the history of Harvard, thrown into many of the biographies, and how it worked so hard to keep women from entering universities, not just their university, but all universities. The way male experts in a position of power treated intelligent women is without question an important thing to understand and remember. So many wonderful women. A must read. "
16,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1146532-robin,5,"This is a great book. The introduction recommends reading one profile per week, for a full year of inspiration. I ate it up over the summer and I highly recommend it.Swaby's writing style is entertaining and informative. Each 3-4 page entry covers a scientist's major contribution to her field and gives a glimpse into her personality. The book is thematically arranged, with sections on medicine, genetics, the environment, physics, earth and stars, math, and invention, and organized chronologically within those, making it clear that women have been doing great science since forever.This is a fine jumping off point for further explorations, as it introduces some scientists you probably had not heard of before; it would be great for high school students starting a longer project, or kids who know they like science but aren't 100% clear what's out there for career options. This belongs in every middle and high school library and I am giving it to one of my favorite science-leaning kids."
17,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"What a great read. I tore through this in under a day, and science isn't even an area of particular interest for me. The book illuminates many female scientists of history that I must shamefully admit I had never heard of (along with a decent scattering I recognised), going into their background, work, and what their contribution meant as part of the bigger picture. More than that, the book is eminently readable; each scientist gets a handful of pages, meaning it's easy to pick up, read a few pages and come to a point and then decide you probably have enough time to read the next entry, and the next..."
18,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5261455-caroline,1,"Unfortunate execution of a good idea. Too many people for one book, so superficial, so colloquial, so bad. If someone has a recommendation for a good book about women scientists I’d love to hear it; I’m also working on American Women Scientists: 23 Inspiring Biographies, which is better but a) limited to Americans, b) doesn’t include some women I’m interested in like Maria Mitchell, c) still aimed a bit to a younger audience. Interested more in physical sciences/math."

WHY DID YOU MAKE THEM 2-3 PAGES LONG. and it's probably only me, but i did not feel like reading them. i'm sorry.#5: kudos for the backwhile the writing in this book is satisfactory, the back description always makes me laugh. read below the beginning-In 2013, the New York Times published an obituary for Yvonne Brill. It began: “She made a mean beef stroganoff, followed her husband from job to job, and took eight years off from work to raise three children.”and that, ladies and gents, is how you start a description. indicating how brill made a ""mean beef stroganoff"" rally emphasizes what woman were thought as. and that's my five thoughts. this quote though “The materials of science are the materials of life itself. Science is part of the reality of living; it is the what, the how, and the why of everything in our experience.” "
21,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/698464-erin,4,"How have I gone through life without knowing that Lord Byron's daughter was the first one to broach the idea of using algorithms for computing machines? I feel like a failure as a feminist and an English major.3.5 stars. I'll be honest - I didn't love Swaby's writing style. I found it overly slangy & sometimes confusing. That said, she exposed me to dozens of women I had no idea existed. I enjoyed learning about the women that discovered the Earth's Inner Core, started pediatric cardiology, disproved concepts that were considered to be fundamental laws of physics, created successful forms of treating leprosy, and more. What Swaby does well is create enthusiasm about the breadth of accomplishments of these women, and appreciation for how difficult it was for these women to overcome sexism, anti-Semitism, racism and poverty to rise to the levels they did. And while the brevity of the sketches sometimes left me wanting more, I'll admit that I probably wouldn't have attempted something with more depth, so I think I'm solidly in the target audience for a book like this (and not alone there). I would gladly hand this book to a teenager to expose them not only to female role models in the field, but also the diverse spheres of the sciences and mathematics that are available to them, and the creativity involved in the work (something I feel I lacked as a teenager)."
22,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5099486-lynndee-lynndee-s-library,4,"Science is not my forte whatsoever, so about 75% of the time I was like, ""that sounds really cool, and I'm definitely impressed, but I still have no idea what it means"". Either way, this is a great book to learn about female scientists from around the world and throughout history that have ""changed science...and the world"". A lot of them I had never heard of before, probably because they weren't given credit when credit was due, and they didn't really teach about famous female scientists (except for Marie Curie) when I was in elementary/middle school. This should definitely be required reading. "
23,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2999717-jacqueline-j,3,Read this for bookclub and was totally not looking forward to it. I expected it to be very dry. Instead it was quite entertaining and easy to read. The book is a series of short bios of women in STEM fields throughout history. These are not the women you have heard of like Curie but women who made important contributions who you've never heard of. This would be a wonderful read for middle school or high school girls who are interested in the STEM fields. Quite inspiring.

26,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"These 52 capsule biographies of women scientists were a little too brief and superficial for my taste, but I'm so pleased that people are reading/listening to this book (my library's wait-list is surprisingly long). If I were a parent I would put this recording into the car's audio system and let this thing play on an everlasting loop - girls and boys both should hear about Barbara McClintock and Lise Meitner, Marie Tharp, Ada Lovelace, and the truth of the smear campaign against Rosalind Franklin. One quibble is the preponderance of white American women such that it might initially appear that the U.S. must be/has been a positive and nurturing environment for women in science. But the truth is shameful: dedicated scientists spending their lives struggling against institutionalized sexism for the opportunity to study, to be acknowledged as essential contributors, even to be paid for their work. And sometimes winning a Nobel Prize or two."

I would appreciate it more if personal life was mention so that we have a better view of work-life balance that each of them had to maintain. This is not trivial. In general, a balanced personal-professional life can be beneficial for both career and personal development, health and longevity. This balance is unfortunately more difficult to achieve for women because of gender-biased expectations on women. We need more books that support women fighting with patriarchy."

Completely empowering and fantastic. It makes you question history and want to conquer the world. It was only the first page where I died laughing: ""There have been instances, and I have been such, of females... graduated from school or college excellent scholars, but with underdeveloped ovaries. Later they are married, and were sterile."" BAHAHA. I can't even.""The system never does two tings well at the same time. The muscles [menstruation] and the brain cannot functionate in their best way at the same moment.""All I could think of was this:I think every woman should read this book. Realize your own strength. You don't have to live in a mans shadow. You don't have to have children. You don't have to get married. You are your own self. You can achieve your dreams. Break the stereotype and ""expectations"" of what the world wants from you. If you like this book then I recommend The Guerrilla Girl's Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art.

I did and didn't like the narrator at times but hearing about the women who changed the scientific world was inspiring and defiant and astonishing. I listened this mostly because if I become a primary teacher, I want to be able to talk about as women in science as confidently as anything else. Children cannot be what they cannot see, so knowing that a woman invented kevlar is all part of that. My favourite part of the book was the 'Medicine' chapters -- I don't know why, but there was some added emotional layer to that section that just really stuck with me. The book is overwhelmingly white and contains mostly British and American scientists, which the author acknowledges as an issue in and of itself. The sections itself were also really condensed, which totally worked, but then there were a lot of fascinating women where I would be begging for more information. I did however, really enjoy that there were a lot of supportive partners in each of these women's lives. Husbands, boyfriends, girlfriends, fathers, all cheering on their loved ones -- it really brought it home for me that even if you are a brilliant person, you cannot do it alone.This book could be effectively summed up as ""She would not be given her PhD, but after years of research, work and ground-breaking inventions, they gave it to her anyway, along with a Nobel Prize.""I'm happy I read this book and I really hope to read more like it. <3"

I wonder how much more progress the human race could have made, had such a large percentage of the population not been marginalized.On the structure: The book is easy to pick up and put down, given its micro-chapters. As I read, though, I found myself wishing for more in-depth information. Perhaps an integrated bibliography would have helped? Also, it's organized by scientific field when I think a chronological order would have given me a better sense of the big picture."

As a woman in science, reading how they overcame not being given the basic like offices or a paycheck despite their incredibly valuable contributions made me realize how lucky I am to have the support I do. The stories were short and gave a great snapshot of each woman as the kick-ass people they were. I might have to buy this to continue to encourage myself more often that the seemingly impossible is sometimes quite possible."

43,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6079888-catherine-flusche,5,"I picked this book mostly on a gut instinct based on the title and the cover while looking for my next book to blog for. I didn't think twice about getting this one and ordered it immediately. When I received it in the mail, I was kind of astonished to realize that I'd already put it on my mental to-read list, though it hadn't actually made it to my physical one on Goodreads. I'd stumbled upon the blurb originally during one of my monthly forays into the physical newspaper at work (I only browse it whilst waiting for my food to reheat in the microwave and usually don't make it past the front page).I can only say that I'm thrilled that this book reappeared in my life :-). I loved that the first mini-biography (or rather micro-biographies) was about Mary Putnam Jacobi (1842-1906) who put a lot of effort into writing a well researched paper on exactly why it was utter bullshit that educating women caused their ovaries to shrivel up and die (as was the leading argument by a male who didn't like the idea of educating women). I though this the perfect place to start this amazing list of women.However, if you were expecting to find a blurb on Marie Curie in this book, you'll be sadly disappointed. I don't really agree with the reasoning behind this omission (it's discussed in the introduction)--that she's simply too famous to be included. The methodology for choosing these 52 women (which does include Iréne Joliot-Curie, one of Marie's daughters) doesn't say that they must be women who were overlooked during their day. Unwittingly when I was ordering my books from the library for this month(s), I grabbed Almost Famous Women where I do expect to find a lack of the usual favorites. The women in this book run the gambit of those who were ignored, stolen from, and those who were actually given a lot of praise sooner or later in their career (the category to which Curie belongs).I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by the limited scope of these micro-biographies. Generally, except for when a bit of author's bias creeps in, these are cut and dry descriptions of where these ladies came from, what their passion was, and how they went about making their discoveries. There is just a bare hint that one of the reasons Jacobi was so pissed off by Clarke's book (Sex in Education; or, A Fair Chance for Girls) was because she was a mother as well as a scientist, so obviously her ovaries hadn't shriveled up beyond use. While I too find it appalling that the obituary that gave rise to this book listed Yvonne Brill's ""mean stroganoff"" well before mentioning that she was a brilliant rocket scientist, I think it harmful to disregard how these women themselves felt about their circumstances. I consider myself a ""practical libertarian communist"" with the communist aspect being relevant here: at work, I feel proud when we as a team succeed. I don't need the personal accolades or recognition to feel like I've done a good job. I don't even mind when someone else takes credit for something that I've done a lot of work on, namely because of the smug satisfaction I have knowing that without me they'd fall flat on their face. So long as I make a fair wage for the work that I've done, anyone and their brother can step in and claim all the glory. Of course, if they were able to reap the benefits of this glory without me benefiting as well (not foreseeable where I work), then I'd happily step aside and let the glory-takers prove their worth. Currently for me this ""glory"" is the responsibility of talking to customers and solving the problems that I try my damnest to prevent before they happen even though this is NOT my responsibility, which is why I can't stop a good half of them.Anyway, I just dislike when people decide that folks who are seemingly ""oppressed"" should feel outrage over their situation. Different strokes for different folks, as I say, so while it's nice to see a generally cut and dry account of these women's scientific achievements, I think it's unfair to not list her children if at the end of the day she felt that that was her biggest achievement.While these micro-biographies are informative, I think they should just be the jumping off point for further research. I know I plan to look into at least a few of these ladies more in depth. I may even finish Madame Curie which I set aside immediately after reading the part about her husband's death. Otherwise it was a really good book!I received this book for free from Blogging For Books in exchange for this honest review.https://soyourfriendlikestoread.wordp..."

45,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18051524-matt,5,"“Headstrong” is a joy to read, celebrating the triumph of human accomplishment, in the lives of 52 amazing women scientists. Despite the history of inequalities, which still persist, these women defined hard work and dedication, and made the world a better place. A collection rather than a continuous timeline, there are some overlaps and connections, such as in genetics and developmental biology, and in the physics department as well – after all, it is a small world we live in. The books is well organized in this sense, well written, and refreshingly positive.We go as far back as Maria Sibylla Merian, the German entomologist born in 1647, up to Sally Ride (hopefully you’ve at least heard of her!) and most recent to pass, chemist and inventor Stephanie Kwolek. Partly a result of the author’s decision to only include women who are no longer living, many of these women began their careers in the Great Depression, when resources were especially hard to come by. Also, many Jewish scientists, including some of these women, were forced into exile during World War II. Some were more assertive, some were more humble; all overcame great obstacles to see their work through. They knew the importance of the work they were doing – one reason the book is titled as is.The author did an outstanding job of boiling down the biographies, telling good stories, and giving the essence of the science involved. As a good historian, Swaby shows through context how people got to be where they were, not like simply reading off a list of career highlights. For example, I did not know paleoneurology was a discipline. That area of research was founded singlehandedly by Tilly Edinger, and broke new ground in evolutionary biology. I already knew and admired the work of Rachel Carson and Lynn Margulis, and now I have many more heroines to look to. Swaby often puts in a question to remind the reader of a previously mentioned accomplishment, to return to it and explain what the scientist did to advance scientific knowledge.This book is one I know I will be re-reading again and again. Like “Microbe Hunters,” there is adventure, ingenious experimental design, and perseverance through mountainous challenges. While the biographies may be shorter, and more numerous, the subjects are just as significant. Swaby’s book is like an extension of the Ada Lovelace Day and “Edit-a-thon.” There is so much more out there that isn’t common (enough) knowledge. Rachel Swaby has done a great service, quite long-overdue, of bringing more attention to the outstanding contributions by what is really only a handful of scientists who happened to be women. In their time, unequal pay was even worse than it is now – many weren't paid at all, with universities reluctant to take them on as professors. To add insult to injury, they were often cheated out of publication credit, Rosalind Franklin being the most famous example. Yet, in addition to their scientific breakthroughs, they fought for equal representation and opportunities for future generations of women. These are scientists, not “whole binders full of women.” As an aspiring scientist myself, I found “Headstrong” a very inspiring and enjoyable read.

46,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2252703-ashleigh,5,"This book is amazing. These women, all 52 of them, were incredible. They make me proud to be a scientist, to follow the path that they essentially paved for me and my female friends to be able to do what we do. They gave us access and fought for our voices to be heard. Every single woman featured in this book is a superhero and I wouldn't be doing what I do without them.This book was born from the author reading an obituary in the newspaper. Yvonne Brill made a ""mean beef stroganoff"", she was a wife, a mother and there was over half a page of column dedicated to her. Why? She was an incredible rocket scientist. A rocket scientist who developed technology still used by NASA today (hydrazine jet propulsion if anyone cares!). And all the New York Times cared about was her ""mean beef stroganoff"", that was more important than the work she did for over 50 years. After reading this, Rachel Swaby decided enough was enough and it was about time people heard about the amazing women who have changed science (and coincidentally, the world) but are little heard about, some even forgotten entirely from scientific circles (never mind the general public!). There are women in medicine, biological sciences, environmental sciences, chemistry, physics, engineering, and mathematics who have been overwritten in history. Some names remain, most people know who Marie Curie was, but her daughter Irene was equally as incredible and also won a Nobel prize to go with her mothers two. Many people have heard of Ada Lovelace and Florence Nightingale. But there are so many more amazing women out there; Rosalind Franklin identified the signature double helix of DNA. Lise Meitner discovered nuclear fission. Dorothy Hodgkin discovered the structure of Vitamin B12. Inge Lehmann discovered the inner core of the Earth. Virginia Apgar developed the APGAR test which has saved countless of newborn babies. Helen Taussig revolutionised heart surgery. Alice Ball was a black woman in her twenties who treated leprosy. All of these women are incredible, inspiring too. And while they only get three or four pages each, their intelligence and determination comes across so clearly. I wish, oh I wish, I could have some of these women round for dinner and just thank them, talk to them, have some of their insight because they're incredible.These women inspire me. Everyone should know about these women. This book is something special, it has it's faults, the writing is a bit questionable, and jumbled, at times but the reasoning behind this book and the overall presentation is faultless. I would love more on each of these women, but the idea of reading about one woman a week for a year that is put forward in the introduction I think is great for the non-specialist or the person who just wants to read about an awesome woman once a week! I devoured it in under a week, I read a couple of sections a day (the book is split in to seven scientific disciplines). This is by no means a book for scientists only. This is a book that, I feel, could benefit anyone. If I had known about these women earlier on in my life it would have probably sparked my interest in science sooner!"
47,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,5,"Today’s post is on Headstrong: 52 Women Who Changed Science- and the World by Rachel Swaby. It is 269 pages long including notes, index, bibliography and is published by Broadway Books. The cover is white with pictures of the women on it. The intended reader is someone who is interested in women’s history, scientific history and good writing. There is no sex, no language, and no violence in this book. The stories are told from the third person with first person details added. There Be Spoilers Ahead. From the back of the book- In 2013, the New York Times published an obituary for Yvonne Brill. It began: “She made a mean beef stroganoff, followed her husband from job to job, and took eight years off from work to raise three children.” It wasn’t until the second paragraph that readers discovered why the New York Times had devoted several hundred words to her life: Brill was a brilliant rocket scientist who invented a propulsion system to keep communications satellites in orbit, and she had recently been awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. Among the questions the obituary- and consequent outcry- prompted were, Who are the role models for today’s female scientists, and where can we find the stories that cast them in their true light?Headstrong delivers a powerful, global, and engaging response. Covering Nobel Prize winners and major innovators, as well as lesser-known but hugely significant scientists who influence our every day, Rachel Swaby’s vibrant profiles span centuries of courageous thinkers and illustrate how each one’s ideas developed, from their first moment of scientific engagement through the research and discovery for which they’re best known. This fascinating tour reveals theses fifty-two women at their best- while encouraging and inspiring a new generation of girls to put on their lab coats.Review- This is an interesting read about a lot of women that I knew nothing about. Swaby is a good writer taking very big lives, work, and long history and turns into something that you can easily read and understand. She covers women from all walks of science from technology to physics. She gives some insight into their lives but mostly focuses on their professional work. What they did at home, if they had one was, secondary if talked about at all. The writing is very strong without going into repetition. Which is more that I can say for myself, I am at a loss to really describe this book other than it is well written, about an interesting subject, and I learned about interesting people. Read it.I give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I borrowed this book from my local library."
48,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882077-anoush,5,"I rated this a 5-star book not because it's a page turner or because of particularly stellar writing, but I rated it so highly because of the wealth of information it provides, although it only touches the surface of women's lives and contributions to science. The best way to read this book is perhaps one story at a time, a few pages a day or perhaps one person a week. While each woman's work is only briefly represented in this book, it represents the work of a lifetime.Swaby gives a brief (about 3 pages) glimpse into the lives of 52 women who worked within fields from Medicine and Biology to Physics and Computer Programming. I found each sketch fascinating and I wanted to know more about almost every single woman. They were all inspiring and made remarkable contributions to their fields. Most of them I wasn't even aware of personally, although I consider myself a scientist and my research is built upon the kind of breakthroughs shown in this book.I can only imagine how hard it was to pare this book down to 52 women while still showing the variety and influence of their work, not to mention the prejudices many of them faced. I would love to see a spreadsheet or some other visual illustration of their lives: what their families looked like, how long they lived, if their research was deleterious to their health, what awards they received what awards they should have received, etc. So many of these women seemed to struggle more with recognition and funding than their actual research, while contemporaries seemed to have no trouble at all being accepted as legitimate in their chosen field. Rosalyn Sussman Yalow responded to discrimination saying, ""Personally, I have not been terribly bothered by it . . . if I wasn't going to do it one way, I'd manage to do it another way.""I loved seeing their motivations. Gertrude Belle Elion was motivated by the deaths of very close family members and friends to develop pharmaceuticals. Rachel Carson thought she left behind her training in English and experience writing to be a marine biologist but ended up using those skills as an activist, as she said ""It never occurred to me [when I began studying marine biology] that I was merely getting something to write about."" This book is evidence to the inventor Hertha Ayerton's statement, ""Personally I do not agree with sex being brought into science at all. The idea of 'women and science' is entirely irrelevant. Either a woman is a good scientist or she is not; in any case she should be given opportunities, and her work should be studied from the scientific, not the sex, point of view."""
49,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9708683-dr-lillian,5,"""Headstrong"" by Rachel Swaby is my new favorite non-fiction book! In this book, the accomplishments of fifty-two women in science are described in detail, but not in the common textbook way. Swavy chose these fifty-two women because they are not typically the scientists students learn about in school; these woman comprise multiple nationalities, fields of research, and time periods (from the 1600s to today!). Marie Curie and Sally Ride are now ""household scientist"" names, but what about Inge Lehmann? Emmy Noether? Hedy Lamarr? Mary Anning? (Lamarr might sound familiar because she was a famous Hollywood film star, too -- ""Beauty AND brains, can you imagine?!"" ... that's sarcasm, in case you didn't notice.).In my opinion, Swaby makes this book attractive to readers because the biographies are relatively short but remain detailed. The history of these women are not written over the course of dozens of pages droning on about their early life, education, and accomplishments. Instead, each chapter reads more like a vignette, giving you a glimpse of the most influential pieces of a woman's life and her ""claim to fame,"" and although brief, these chapters are highly inspirational. Think: the basic facts you'd get on a baseball card, but with some more details thrown in. For instance, the chapter on Inge Lehmann, a Danish seismologist who discovered Earth's core, tells of her early, solitary work, and the recognition that came later in her career and lasted through her retirement. Maria Mitchell's (American astronomer) chapter details her early astronomical efforts with her makeshift observatory as a child, her achievement of becoming the first American to discover a comet and chart it's orbit, and her teaching position at Vassar College. As a woman in science (planetary science!), I find it fascinating to read about the lives and motivation of other women scientists, especially those who persevered when being a scientist was not ""fashionable"" or socially acceptable. After a day of scientific setbacks, I crack open this book, pick a woman to read about, and get inspired all over again.

50,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2877693-leeanna,5,"This review originally appeared on my blog, Leeanna.me.==HEADSTRONG: 52 WOMEN WHO CHANGED SCIENCE -- AND THE WORLD is a needed book. I wish it wasn’t, but it is. Even in 2015, women still struggle to make their way in male dominated fields like physics, astronomy, computer science, mathematics, etc. I experienced discrimination based on my gender when I was a computer science student. I’ve been told I’m not a “real geek” because I’m a girl. Although I’m no Yvonne Brill -- the inspiration for this book, whose accomplishments as a rocket scientist were overshadowed by her domestic abilities by the New York Times -- I understood the struggle every woman mentioned in this book went through. And I’m ashamed to say I’d heard of maybe 4 out of the 52. HEADSTRONG is separated into 7 sections: medicine, biology and the environment, genetics and development, physics, earth and stars, math and technology, and invention. To be included in the book, the author picked “only scientists whose life’s work has already been completed (xiii).” Due to that, the author admits the book is not very diverse, as opportunities opened up first for white women. She also didn’t include Marie Curie, because if you think of a woman scientist, that’s likely the one you picture. But did you know Marie Curie’s daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize? The profiles are relatively short, 3-5 pages, and focus on the woman’s contributions to her field. I read one or two sections a night and felt like I learned a ton about women in science. For example, I never knew a woman invented Kevlar, or wrinkle free cotton, or the Apgar score. The profiles are easy enough to understand for young girls, and interesting enough to hold the attention of older readers. What will you learn? ==Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. See more of my reviews:

"
51,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5471413-nancy-kennedy,5,"This is such a great idea for a book! Brief profiles of 52 women who made mostly unheralded contributions to science and technology. We tend to think that women only began making headway once the women's movement got rolling in the late 1900s. But here, author Rachel Swabey reaches back into history to find women who were studying nature or medicine or already working in science fields from the 1800s onward.Ms. Swabey digs deeper than most of us do in school. Women in science? I think we'd all come up with Marie Curie, the two-time Nobel prize winner. But Ms. Swabey bypasses her to write instead about her daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, who also won a Nobel Prize. Yes, Sally Ride, an astrophysicist and the first woman in space is here, but so is Yvonne Brill, a Canadian astrophysicist whose name I'd never heard and whose obituary began, ""She made a mean beef stroganoff,"" before mentioning that she invented a way to keep satellites in orbit. And, the actress Hedy Lamarr... an inventor who wanted to create a better way to guide torpedoes during World War II! Who knew?The profiles are obviously meant to be bright and breezy, and the author's tone reflects that. At times, it was a little grating; I felt that the author was trying hard to entertain younger readers. For example, here's how she writes about Ride's hurdles as a female astronaut: ""No, but seriously: the agency's push for women and people of color was summarized as a total fail by the person in charge of it.""I also found myself wanting more depth to the profiles. At three to six pages long (some even less), a life story goes along at a breathtaking clip. For example, about Helen Taussig, a pioneer in pediatric cardiology, Ms. Swabey writes, ""Taussig literally wrote the textbook on congenital heart defects"" and that she helped block production of a medicine that caused birth defects. I would have liked to know the title of the book and the name of the medicine. Still, I know more now than I did before.For an indepth profile of another woman in science, you might like Rocket Girl: The Story of Mary Sherman Morgan, America's First Female Rocket Scientist, although it's a story that errs on the side of overembellishment, written as it is by the subject's son."
52,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1025214-whitney,5,"Headstrong is a collection of fifty-two short biographies of women scientists who are lesser known, but made significant contributions to science. We learn who these women were, their contribution to science, and how they got to the point where they made their contribution. The focus is on what they are best known for, as it is just a brief overview of each woman. The book only includes women whose life's work has been completed as a way to narrow the focus of the book.As soon as I read the title of this book, I knew it was one I wanted to read. After reading the introduction, I was hooked. I love the idea that women in science should be judged on their work and not on their gender. I also liked the idea that we should be able to recall a woman scientist besides Marie Curie(not to diminish her achievements). The women included in this book are divided into the categories: Medicine, Biology and Environment, Genetics and Development, Physics, Earth and Stars, Math and Technology, and Invention. I liked that they were divided by field as it helped the flow of the book and with the author's thought that ""instead of saying the Marie Curie of her field, say a woman of that field who made a great contribution."" I liked the set up of the book.I think this is an important book for every one to read. Not only does it make us more aware of the significant contributions women have made in science, but it can provide roll models(particularly for women) in science. I was surprised by how many of these women I had never heard of. I highly recommend reading this book. It provided a lot of interesting information in an easy to grasp way. I only wish there was more about some of the women. I would get very interested in someone, and their story would be over. It gave me some women I want to read more about. **I received a free copy of this book from Blogging For Books in exchange for an honest review**"

Wonder Women: 25 Innovators, Inventors, and Trailblazers Who Changed History
, so it has been a December of kickass smart women for me and in some ways, my experience of both books has been colored by the fact I read them together. So—they're going to share a review. Where Swaby is mostly interested in covering the whole field, every field in fact, and doing so thoroughly and with a professional tone which is still accessible to, say, young teenagers ... well, Maggs is interested in fighting the patriarchy, introducing a diverse and global perspective, and giving full range to her sharp wit and eye for the dramatic. Swaby is where I'll go if I want to dig up a list of women to do more research on; Maggs is where I'll go if I need a good dollop of entertainment and a litany of stories to re-tell around the giant LGBTQIA+ fireplace in my heart. Marie Equi rides through my imagination with her horse-whip held high, let's just say. But both books, I think, are necessary to each other, or at least they exist in useful conversation with each other. I need the range and detail that Swaby brings, and I need the validation and color that Maggs brings. Don't read just one—have your cake and eat it too, along with your toast, your chocolate, and your baklava. Individually, these are good books. Together, they are magnificent."
54,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71658-aj,4,"Headstrong consists of 52 brief chapters about women scientists who have largely been overlooked in their contributions to humanity. Some of them (Sally Ride, Rosalind Franklin, Rachel Carson) may be more familiar than others. It's a sad fact that we still need a lot of books like this; honestly we need books like this that are geared for children, so that young girls can see themselves as scientists, mathematicians, engineers and inventors.The only thing I disliked about this book I can't really fault it for. I'm sure the author hasn't gone through education (undergraduate and graduate) or a career as a scientist or engineer. One of the major reasons that women don't stay in the field is the emphasis on living your life 100% for your work, leaving no time outside for hobbies, families, or even sleep. That really goes double for women, who still have to be twice as good and work twice as hard to convince our advisors and supervisors that we're worth giving good projects to and supporting. The scientists profiled in Headstrong are all the ""exceptional"" women who give 100% to their work, and that's mentioned as a really good thing. I don't think that's the standard that anybody should be held to, and I know that one book isn't going to change the way things are, but it would be nice if we could start moving to other viewpoints of life as a scientist."
55,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8485900-my-book-strings,4,"Swaby’s book is made up of biographies of 52 scientists in the fields of medicine, biology/environment, genetics/development, physics, astronomy, mathematics, and invention. The introduction suggests reading one profile a week, thus taking one year to finish the book. That would make the book very easy to digest, but it would take far too long to find out about some amazing people who deserve to be much better and much wider known than they currently are. The women in this book are all great role models and show what determination and perseverance can get you. If there were no research positions available for women in their field, they pushed and prodded until someone relented and gave them a job. If the equipment they needed for their research didn’t exist, they invented it. If someone tried to talk over them, they simply talked louder and faster.While it is true that the profiles are rather short, it is easy enough to look up those scientists who peak your interest. I found this book very entertaining and very inspiring."
56,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/686407-james-mason,5,"I really enjoyed this book. The writing style was fun and the stories were inspiring. Of course I also learned a lot and also heard some of the stories I've read about in other books from a new perspective. While each vignette was short, the author did a great job always tying to the central theme of lasting impact and social injustice. It's hard to read this book and not recognize that there must be so many women out there right now that have major contributions to make to the world but are being held back by the absurd social constructs we've defined. Highly recommended. "
57,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57479805-cat,5,"Brilliant book. Everyone should read this!Edit: The sole criticism I have of this book, is that there are no eminent female psychologists or neuropsychologist - do we not (still) count as scientists?! Psychology is often considered a 'soft' science but it has revolutionised how we think about the human mind. For example, Mary Ainsworth who researched infant attachment theory, or Eleanor Gibson who established the impact of the environment on the developing sensory system. "
58,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7099433-elisabeth,3,"I like it, but it's slow going - more the kind of thing you pick up and read a bit, then go read other things for a while before coming back - and has to go back to the library. A wealth of excellent information, probably worth owning.eta Finished it, haven't changed my opinion. It's definitely good information/reference/inspiration, and there's a bibliography for those who want more. The writing is not the greatest in places but it doesn't get too much in the way."
59,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41536614-nukie19,4,"This was a great intro book to 52 remarkable women. Unfortunately, the inclusion of such a large number of women relegated most of their lifetime achievements to only a few pages. I think this would be a great book for a science classroom to introduce young students to these women, but to sit down and read all at once makes for a very disjointed experience. "

These stories are not just about women, but pioneers in all aspects of life. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs some inspiration; and I'm sure that I'll need to come back to it for future doses."
61,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23703346-di,5,Should be required reading in all schools across the nation.

71,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,3,"There are a lot of women profiled in this book. Rather than try to memorize every single one, revel in their indomitableness.It never mattered that others believe things were out of her reach. She knew they weren’t. [about Hertha Ayrton, British engineer, mathematician, physicist, and inventor] This science crowd inspires and assures readers (was Swaby targeting only girls?) of the plethora of female contributors to math and science. Headstrong seems like a rallying cry for “reclaiming our greatness!”This book is divided into sections to help readers chunk information about the women profiled: Medicine, Biology and the Environment, Genetics and Development, Physics, Earth and Stars, Math and Technology, and Invention. There are so many ladies – that’s the point. However, the question remains: is reading about amazing women scientists enough to get more girls to enter those fields? Is the lack of role models truly the reason for the loss of female interest in the decades since the 60’s Feminist Movement? These questions need asking if we are to fill the void. I doubt this is the problem because my daughters are pursuing STEM fields and they have no such role models. We know several kids with STEM parent role models and none of them are choosing STEM for college or career. The only other kid we know studying STEM in college participated in STEM activities in high school (Robotics), as did my kids. Exposing kids to puzzles and problem-solving, problem-defining, challenging, building activities probably has a stronger pull toward STEM fields than simply providing role models.I liked reading about the women’s grit and other admirable characteristics more than the details of their achievements. This is a collection of stories about determination rather than feminism, as some reviewers believe. Each person also has some degree of support, help, and luck – not to be discounted, according to Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers: the Story of Success (2008)

. Whether it was access to education, a supportive parent, or a colleague who co-researched and co-wrote papers, they did not succeed in a vacuum.Swaby also conveyed her frustration over the unfairness of historians dismissing women despite earning the respect of their peers.In 1964, when Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin won the greatest award that chemistry has to offer, a newspaper declared “Nobel Prize for British Wife,” as if she had stumbled upon the complex structures of biochemical substances while matching her husband’s socks. We simply don’t speak of men in science this way. Their marital status isn’t considered necessary context in a biochemical breakthrough. For men, scientific accomplishments are accepted as something naturally within their grasp.Having a hard time of it is not necessarily bad. Dismissive, prevailing attitudes toward women scientists winnowed out the chaff; only the smartest, strongest-willed women succeeded. I’m proud of them. At the end of this book, you will be too.Another inspiring book about remarkable women in math and technology is Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly 

. It’s about extremely hard-working NASA Calculators (the title for people who did all the math calculations needed, by hand!) who didn’t whine about society or unfairness, were proud of their work, didn’t feel isolated by their abilities or opportunities, and played a vital role in rocket technology. First-hand accounts and interviews of people who knew the Calculators make this a more compelling narrative than Headstrong."
72,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,3,"I love the IDEA of this book far more than I loved the execution. This is definitely a needed resource. Of the 52 women profiled, I knew of only 8 well enough to be able to say approximately what they did. I read one entry every few days. I knew, of course, that these would be very brief biographies, and they were, but I did wish there was a bit more. So many times, a vague and intriguing tidbit was left dangling. For example, in the section for Helen Taussig:
Taussig was also instrumental in convincing the Food and Drug Administration to block a medicine that she believed (rightly) caused birth defects.
What medicine? What defects? How long did it take for her to convince them? Swaby could include all this information in just a few sentences, so why mention it but never explain the details?In the section for Elsie Widdowson:
Widdowson's hands-on approach to research went awry only a few times. When she and McCance carried out another round of self-injections, they wound up on the floor, writhing with fever, tremors, and body aches.
What did they inject? What went wrong? How long until they were found? Why not add in just a few more details?? And, I think Swaby's writing just isn't very exciting or interesting. I wanted to be fascinated by these women, but often I was just bored.I didn't actually even come close to finishing this, because it's not the kind of book you read cover to cover; you need to dip into it now and then, and my library renewals finally ran out. I'll have to borrow it again sometime."
73,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51071812-kaylah,4,"""We live in a scientific age; yet we assume that knowledge of science is the prerogative of only a small number of human beings, isolated and priest-like in their laboratories. This is not true. The materials of science are the materials of life itself. Science is part of the reality of living; it is the what, the how, and the why of everything in our experience."" Rachel CarsonThis book was enlightening and inspiring, yet laced with themes of tragedy and injustice. The 52 women highlighted in this book were only a few of those who have made great strides in their fields, yet overcame so many obstacles to receive the credit they deserve. And even then, sometimes it came too late. I am just so inspired by the stories of these strong, smart, courageous women who went and out and did what they loved, not for glory or money, but because they had passion and a vision. It really got me thinking about all the women who could have been great were it not for the overwhelming obstacles they maybe just weren't able to overcome. Many of the women in this book faced opposition, not just from the stigma of being a woman in science, but were also persecuted for their religion, class, and/or relationship status. I am thankful to have read this book and hope to learn more about often overlooked heros.""The idea of 'women and science' is entirely irrelevant. Either a woman is a good scientist or she is not; in any case she should be given opportunities, and her work should be studied from the scientific, not the sex, point of view."" Hertha Aryton"
74,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39395291-vanessa-rogers,3,"This book should not have taken this long but every time I tried to listen to it in the car it literally started putting me to sleep. Maybe it was Gen Surg, or maybe it was the book, I have no idea. I realized with this one that I prefer in-depth stories about fewer people instead of many short stories about different people. There were a few of these that stood out to me or that I was already aware of, but for the others I can't say that I remember who accomplished what. The overall end result is that I know that a lot of women have accomplished many things, but it's all been blurred together. The other note I have is that it seemed like the majority of included people were American, which does not seem fully representative of the world's history of women in science but that's my own speculation. Was the US that much more accepting of women in science or were they all just included because of convenience?3 stars. Completely fine but like I said, not specifically memorable."

Arrgg.""Headstrong"" is clear, concise and a quick read. It is of value because it fills in the gaps left in a culture which spent most of its history largely ignoring women and their valuable contributions to our society. You should read it.I would recommend this to: Men. Women.PS: Why the 4/5 and not a 5/5? Because it was a little dry (it's history after all). It is not a ding on the value of the book, but evidence of my preferences slightly away from learning a lot of facts in a clear and concise manner. That's on me, not Rachel Swaby."
76,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7326636-vanessa-fuller,5,"Women in STEM. Yes! Yes! Yes! This delightful book places women firmly at the centre of their work and contributions to various breakthroughs and discoveries. Rather than being relegated to the status of 'wife' or 'assistant', they are the pioneers in their respective fields. It's ever-so refreshing, although at times infuriating if only that some women did not receive the recognition they deserved until after their deaths. Whether as a ray of light and hope during these odd times, or as inspiration for young scientists, this is a lively read. If I had a daughter, I'd read it with her, and perhaps dive into the extensive bibliography documenting women's many contributions to STEM."
77,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/641091-naomi,3,"Such an interesting read! Did you know that the Kevlar inventor was a woman (Stephanie Kwolek)? This book is a collection of 52 mini-biographies about women in math and science who made huge impacts despite roadblocks in all directions. So many of these women were not paid for their work, didn't get the recognition for their accomplishments, but loved math and science and pursued their passions anyway. Since the story of each woman is 5-10 pages long, it wasn't a book I could sit down and read through, but it was a nice book to pick up once a month or so to read up on a particular discipline (women in medicine, inventors, etc). It's full of inspiration for sure."

80,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7531830-shaina,4,"Original review here: http://www.shainareads.com/2015/05/wo...Disclaimer: I received Headstrong: 52 Women Who Changed Science—and the World from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review... and then reviewed it almost two months late. Oops. Regardless, thanks to Crown Publishing/Broadway Books for offering me the chance to read it!The other day I was strolling through a local indie bookshop and noticed that Headstrong by Rachel Swaby had finally hit the shelves. I swelled with pride; this was the very first advance review copy that I'd ever been approved for on NetGalley, and here it was in all its published glory! That little bubble burst as soon as I remembered that I was only halfway through the ARC, despite the fact that the book was released back in early April. Well, better later than never, right?Swaby's debut comprises 52 profiles of women and their accomplishments in the hard and medical sciences. Her impetus for writing Headstrong came from the New York Times's cringe-worthy missteps in its obituary of Yvonne Brill. Brill developed technology that allows communications satellites to stay in geosynchronous orbit; even non-rocket scientists like me can understand why that might be important. However, the news outlet thought it fit to lead their obituary with Brill's prowess in the kitchen, as a mother, and as a ""follower"" of her husband rather than, you know, her immeasurable contributions to her field. (A related note: The Times later changed the first paragraph of the obit with no mention of the edits.)An accomplished journalist herself, Swaby laments that this kind of error is all too common when discussing women's scientific accomplishments and entirely absent from media praise of men:""We simple don't speak of men in science this way. Their marital status isn't considered necessary context in a biochemical breakthrough. Employment as an important aerospace engineer is not the big surprise hiding behind a warm plate of noodles."" - Loc. 78, HeadstrongSwaby strikes back against this injustice by painting vibrant, detailed portraits of the women behind a wide swath of scientific breakthroughs, including the inventor of the aquarium (Jeanne Villepreux-Power), the first pioneers in water sanitation testing (Ellen Swallow Richards), food and occupational safety (Alice Hamilton), and in vitro fertilization (Anne McLaren), and the discoverer of the earth's inner core (Inge Lehmann). We also learn about Rosalind Franklin, whom Watson and Crick scooped in the announcement of DNA's double-helix structure (Watson went on to insult Franklin's taste in fashion, classy guy that he is), and Emmy Noether, a brilliant mathematician whom Einstein spoke of as the reason he became competent in certain aspects of calculus. The list goes on and on.Of all the magnificent women Swaby spotlights, her profile of Hedy Lamarr stood out to me in particular. Born in Vienna, Lamarr went on to become both a famed Hollywood actress and a significant contributor to methods that allowed for better guidance of torpedoes and the invention of Wi-Fi, GPS and other technology. Sadly, the only place I'd ever heard of Lamarr before this book was in Little Shop of Horrors, in reference to how hot a date she would be. Lamarr's story isn't unique in this regard; nearly all of these women's careers were rife with sexism. It's maddening (if unsurprising) how reluctant universities once were to allow women among their student and faculty ranks.Some other reviewers have complained that Swaby seemed to favor quantity over quality in her profiles, but I would have to disagree. I would have been glad to have a few more pages about certain women, but I'm happy that she featured a large number of accomplished scientists and gave them the due they've long deserved.I would recommend this book for anyone with even a passing interest in science and a desire to learn more about some of the countless women who helped shape the much more convenient, safe and technologically-sophisticated world we live in today."
81,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23380344-reisa,1,"A very informative book, yes. So informative, it's almost like reading a textbook - complete with the shallow nuance that is often irritating. If i was an impressionable young woman, what I would take away from this book is that intelligent women scientists capable of ""changing science and the world"" must almost always come from the USA, Germany, Britain, or France.... Sometimes maybe from Italy, rarely from any Asian country, and never from any African or South American country. I mean I guess if that's actually representative of the distribution of capable female scientists in the planet then that's sad regardless. My expectations were too high for this book."
82,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349605-erica-tuggle,4,"The pivotal line of this book is delivered by Hertha Ayrton, who was a scientist, an author, a close friend of Marie Curie, and the inventor of a fan that dispersed noxious gas away from soldiers. She is quoted as saying: ""Personally I do not agree with sex being brought into science at all. The idea of 'women and science' is entirely irrelevant. Either a woman is a good scientist or she is not; in any case she should be given opportunities, and her work should be studied from the scientific, not the sex, point of view.""This is the standard of measure of all the women in the book Headstrong by Rachel Swaby. In this work, Swaby covers the lives and contributions of 52 women in varying branches of science including invention, physics, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and more. Why 52? Swaby reasons that there are 52 weeks in a year, and so in reading this book you can learn about a different female scientist each week.Each selection is just a snapshot of their life and their lasting impact to human progress and innovation. Some of these portraits are only two pages long; the longest is only about 5 pages. Although each segment is brief, the value of having so many different contributions by women compiled together effectively drives home the point of the impact women have made to the umbrella of science area which they fall under and upon the larger world.The work is fact-filled, interesting, full of trivia, and delivers strong evidence of the value of female scientists without harping on or getting lost in hot-button issues like male dominance in science and exclusion of women in the field. The book deals in facts, and these include the struggles women had to go to in obtaining education and standing in their passions within fields where they were the glaring minority.My favorite profiles included those of Gerty Radnitz Cori, a Biochemistry scientist responsible for our understanding of glycogen; Virginia Apgar, who developed a test to establish newborn health standards; Marry Anning, a pioneer in paleontology and fossil discovery; Tilly Edinger, a Jewish woman who encountered Nazi targeting in establishing paleoneurology; Rachel Carson, the voice behind environmental awareness and author of ""Silent Spring""; Rosalind Franklin, whom developed a structure of DNA that was ""borrowed"" by Watson and Crick; Hedy Lamarr, an well-known actress who also worked in tandem to invent a system for coded radio waves to aid torpedo navigation during war-time; and household name Florence Nightingale, responsible among many other contributions for her statistics work and suggestions for improved hospital conditions like better lighting and quiet time for recuperation that are still being pursued today.Headstrong was enlightening and kept my interest. I see this being a valuable tool for students in researching these scientists, and grasping the timeline of scientific discovery more fully through human interest stories such as these. For me, this would be a recommended reading for college freshman or AP high-schoolers. The work is well-researched and written, and with such a variety of topics of interest that spurred me to want to know more about each of these women.I would highly-recommend this read to those who love science, history, feminism, and generally just a good read.I received this book from Blogging for Books for this review."
83,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7343363-ruthie,4,"Headstrong: 52 Women Who Changed Science - and the World, by Rachel Swaby, is a great book. For years there has been a bias against women in the sciences, and as intellects in general. That's ridiculous of course, women are just as intelligent as men, and anyone who says different needs an attitude adjustment. Swaby decided to write this book after, Yvonne Brill was written up in the New York Times. The initial paragraph in the article talked about her great stroganoff and her life as a wife and mother. It wasn't until the second paragraph that they bothered to mention, ""and oh by the way, she's an award winning rocket scientist."" Now I'm not going to knock a good recipe, or being a wife and mother. Those are all great things, and require lots of hard work. However, by listing those first the paper was implying that all of that was more important than her scientific achievements. Bollocks. I wouldn't have a problem if they had listed her as a wife and mother along with the scientific accomplishments, but considering how little recognition women get for their intelligence, I really think it should have come first. Especially considering that's the entire reason they were giving her newspaper space. Swaby agrees with me, and it launched her into writing a book about women in science. The book was well put together, there were a couple little things that bothered me, but they didn't detract from the writing as a whole very much. There were times I felt royally pissed off, but that wasn't the authors fault, it was simply infuriating to read about the ways that women have been pushed aside, belittled, and undervalued. It's heartbreaking how often I saw the words, ""she was given the position finally, but wasn't paid for it."" Or the times where Swaby pointed out that a woman was the brains behind a scientific achievement, or an equal partner in discovering some great thing, but the man involved was the only one who got the recognition. On the flip side, it was incredibly inspiring to read about all the things these women accomplished. Some of them were women I'd heard about, such as Sally Ride and Florence Nightingale, but even the women I had heard of had done so much more than I'd ever known about. I'm not a scientist, or an inventor, those aren't my thing. Still, reading about the things all these women have accomplished made me want to work harder on the things that I do care about, and I am capable of doing. It made me want to write more diligently, and to continue to work on my skills as an artist. .One of the things I also read over and over was that a lot of these women achieved what they did because of perseverance. There were several of them that specifically said they didn't think they were smarter than other people, they just had more patience, and had been willing to work on something for the time necessary to master it, usually for years. Sometimes my goals feel unattainable, and my health problems get in the way and make me want to give up sometimes, but if I am willing to keep at it? It might take me longer than someone else, but I can accomplish a lot if I just continue working on it. It was a reminder I needed, and one that I want to pass on to anyone who reads this. Don't take my word for it though, go read the book! 4 out of 5 Stars. Disclaimer: I was given this book for free in exchange for a fair review by the Blogging for Books program. "
84,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1689436-amanda,4,"https://guninactone.wordpress.com/201...This book was totally inspiring! I almost wished I’d stuck with my original college goals in science after reading Headstrong. Swaby chose 52 amazing women to highlight and by specifically only including women whose “life work has been completed” she really makes you think about how far women have come in the fields like medicine, physics, and chemistry. For example, the first woman featured, Mary Putnam Jacobi who to enter medical school in Paris had to enter lectures through a separate door and maintain a buffer of empty seats around her. Or chemist Ellen Swallow Richards who was the first woman admitted to MIT in 1870. Richards was admitted tuition free – so that if anyone complained about her being a student the school could claim that she was not establishing a precedent for the admission of females.These women were amazing! They were brilliant and all around inspiring. Virginia Apgar – besides coming up with the Apgar test to evaluate newborns – “always kept the following things on her person: a penknife, an endotrachial tube, and a laryngoscope, just in case someone needed an emergency tracheotomy.” And its the BOY Scouts who are prepared?! I could have pulled a quote from any chapter that was this cool!At the same time this book made me kind of want to tear my hair out reading the stories of these geniuses that were unpaid, relegated to work in closets or not given credit for their ideas. Barbara McClintock, who won the Nobel Prize for genetics, was asked if she was bitter that it took so long for the Nobel to come to her she said “When you know you’re right you don’t care. It’s such a pleasure to carry out an experiment when you think of something. …I’ve had such a good time, I can’t imagine having a better one. …I’ve had a very, very satisfying and interesting life.” I really don’t think I could be that big of a person!This was a short book despite the lengthy list of women included and for non-fiction it was a really fast read. TJ at My Book Strings did a great post pairing Headstrong with a children’s book: Girls Think of Everything: Stories of Ingenious Inventions by Women. I cannot wait until Babycakes is just a bit older so we can read this one together! She’s a “mathmagician” she tells me so I cannot wait to show her what amazing women can do.I loved that Swaby points out that if she wrote this book 5 years from now that her book would be much more diverse- I hope she comes out with another book then! It’s going to take me 5 years to read all I can about the women that particularly intrigued me in Headstrong.Headstrong was kind of like an excellent meal at a tapas restaurant. Lots of pleasing small courses- sometimes you’re just left wanting more but you still leave totally satisfied!4 stars!Thank you Random House and Edelweiss for this advance copy in exchange for an honest review.All quotes taken from an unfinished advanced readers copy."
85,0553446797,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4401570-skjam,4,"This is a collection of short biographical sketches of women who made advancements in various scientific fields. According to the introduction, it was inspired when the New York Times ran an obituary of Yvonne Brill that listed her home cooking as her most important accomplishment, followed by being a wife and mother. And only then mentioning that she was an award-winning rocket scientist that made it possible for satellites to adjust their orbits.And it is true that scientists who happen to be women have often been downplayed or outright ignored in books on the history of science. So in the interest of making these scientists more widely known and giving role models to women and girls interested in the sciences, Ms. Swaby picked fifty-two stories to tell. One of her criteria was that they had to be dead, so their entire body of work could be assessed; she points out that this made her list less ethnically diverse as women of color and those outside the Europe/America culture area have been even more hampered in pursuing science careers, though strides have been made in recent decades. Also, she chose to write about Irène Joliot-Curie rather than her mother, as Marie Curie is the Smurfette (the one woman who gets to be in the club) of science books.Ms. Swaby suggests reading one entry a week, but reviewers have to step up the pace, so I did it in two days. The biographies are divided by scientific fields such as medicine, physics and mathematics (Florence Nightingale was listed under the last category for her advances in statistical analysis.) The women profiled go from Mary Putnam Jacobi, who did a medical study disproving the then popular theory that a college education made women infertile to Stephanie Kwolek, the inventor of Kevlar.Many of the stories are bittersweet; the women had to fight to even be allowed to study, were denied paying jobs in their fields, denied credit for their work, denied promotions, titles and awards–and these are just the ones who persisted! Things have improved over time, but one can see where systemic sexism has slowed advancements in science and technology.It should be noted that some of the women in this book did work or had opinions that are still controversial, Certain readers may object to their inclusion, despite their prominence.While the book is written for adults, the language is suitable for junior high students on up. It may be an uncomfortable fit for some male readers, but that’s the way it goes; growth is painful sometimes. Elementary school readers may enjoy Girls Research more; see my review of that book. The volume comes with endnotes, a bibliography for further reading, index, and credits for quotes used.Highly recommended to science fans and those wanting a quick introduction to scientists they may not have known about before.Disclaimer: I received this volume from Blogging for Books for the purpose of writing this review.

In the process of my frustration, I've made a brief pro/con list (at the end of this review) that might benefit future readers or future writers for similar work. The book's author used some good resources so I feel puzzled by the tone of the book. These women each made significant achievements but the tone and perspective (seemingly unintentionally) downplays their accomplishments while making them seem more distanced as people apart from the norm rather than persons a reader would be capable of identifying as a role model. On a limb, I'm guessing I'm not her target audience BUT I really couldn't tell what audience she was trying to target. My guess is that she was trying to make a condensed version of what was contained in books with longer entries. I think there's certainly a market for a book that manages to do this well.Alternative books that have far better quality information:""Nobel Prize Women in Science"" by Sharon McGrayne gives good explanations of the science even for someone without a science background. ""The Madame Curie Complex"" by Julie Des Jardins. Entries are longer than 20-30 pages each but are of substance. Some entries are on individual women and others are on a set of women which worked in a field of study. Brief Pro/Con ListPro: concept book about female contributors to science and engineering entries are brief enough (typically 2-5 pages per person) that they shouldn't be too long for anyone to pick up and read an entry in a few minutes inclusion of notes and citations in the back  organization of the women into fields of contributionCon: rather than focusing on what motivated these women, there was more focus on what people (typically male figures in their lives) gave them a leg up rather than giving a feeling of showing stages of work that led to a discovery/development (there are maybe 1-2 exceptions), it read as though these women were extraordinary among women and they just sat in the tub and thought and BAM genius occurred. While there may be instances of genius like this, reality is much background work occurs before an idea of merit and the ability to explore that idea can mature to a reality the idea that most of these women had NO idea their work was of practical use/significance (Thank God there were men around to see how their work was useful so it could get published/ applied with minimal credit to the inventor. [Please note that this sentence is dripping with sarcasm and disgust.]) vague explanations of what these women actually achieved   "

The distance, however is nothing compared to what all the female scientists experienced in the new book by Rachel Swaby. Today’s women in STEM fields may have a difficult time climbing the corporate ladder, but it wasn’t that long ago when the corporate ladder was clearly marked, Women Not Allowed.Swaby’s book is divided into short chapters each highlighting an individual’s life and career. Don’t be surprise if you haven’t heard the names of most of the honorees. The author specifically selected women who, although produced significant contributions, are relatively unknown. No current women are included as Swaby also chose to concentrate on scientists whose professional life’s work is completed. The struggles to gain an education were impressive, doubly so when you realize they all lived in times when feminine worth was judged by looks and marriage potential. Education was often frowned upon or considered unnecessary, but each of the women in the book was gifted with an iron will and a burning desire to learn. Students often took many years to complete degrees as schools balked at accepting women into graduate programs and financial assistance for them was nonexistent. Education could come in fits and starts. Menial jobs had to be taken in order to earn enough money for classes to continue. Yet, they all persevered. The list of accomplishments will surprise you. Every parent of a newborn has heard of an Apgar score, but almost no one knows it was named after the developer, Dr. Virginia Apgar. Have a family member in the military or police? Say thanks to the inventor of Kevlar, chemist Stephanie Kwolek, for helping to keep them safe.A few names are familiar; Rachel Carson, Sally Ride, and Florence Nightingale are included. One will surely raise an eyebrow. The actress Hedy Lamarr was known for her beauty, not her brains, but during World War II she patented the idea for a frequency hopping system as a way to guide torpedoes. Years later, the technology found unexpected uses in wireless cash registers and bar code readers. This book would be good companion piece for a teacher or anyone interested in the history of science and technology. The biographies are short, but engaging, and neither too technical nor preachy. The reader comes away with respect for these pioneers, and an understanding that the good old days were never that good for women. One quibble I have is that there are 52 profiles, but only a handful of pictures. It would have been nice to start each biography with a visual image.

It just feels like utter failure and I hate having to do it. It's not even that it's a bad book. I got it from the library to qualify for my ""Diversify your reading"" challenge, which for March was Science and Technology. This book seemed both interesting and important and I really did enjoy learning about the women in the first half of the book, but I also pretty much had to force myself to pick the book up to read a few more chapters every few days or so, until suddenly the return date was looming and I couldn't renew the loan, and before you know it, a big ol' DNF.I really do believe that we need more women involved in science and technology and it's absolutely horrendous how for so much of history (and still occasionally) women's work in these fields gets ignored or credited to men. So I feel like a bad feminist for not being able to even read about these ladies' achievements without it feeling like assigned homework and an absolute chore. Yet again I've had it proven to me that with a very demanding job (which involves me reading multiple drafts of usually not very well written essays and/or stories in both Norwegian and English, giving feedback on them and grading them) as well as taking care of a boisterous now sixteen-month-old toddler (who also brings home all manner of crud and illness from his nursery - he usually doesn't get too ill, but my husband and I have alternately or simultaneously been knocked out with various colds, coughs, at least one bout of noro virus, which doesn't exactly help boost one's energy levels), I simply do not have the energy or attention span for anything too intellectually taxing. I need brain fluff, and lots of it.I debated with myself whether I should even allow myself to review the book, but I figured that 1) I did read more than half. 2) I really don't have the output this year to even let half a book go to waste if I'm going to manage to complete a double Cannonball and the other various reading challenges I'm doing. It's also quite cathartic to admit one's failures. In conclusion, this is probably a very interesting and informative non-fiction book if you're in the right mindset for it. It just sadly wasn't right for me.Judging a book by its cover: I really wish I could tell you more about which women are featured in the little bubbles all over this cover, but the only one I recognise is Hedy Lamarr. That in itself is probably a reason I should have finished the book (not that the e-book version I got from the library had pictures of the ladies, at least not as part of the chapters)."

The only science class I ever truly enjoyed was last year's AP Environmental Science, in large part just because I had a great teacher.To put it another way: in a hundred years, no one is going to put me in a list of women who contributed to science. Thus I requested Headstrong with a few reservations about my suitability for the book.I needn't have worried. Because this isn't a chemistry textbook; it's a photo album; A photo album in words of women who did their part to change the world of science forever. Full of anecdotes, quotes, and career sketches, Headstrong contains written snapshots of different people who accomplished amazing things, often despite seemingly impossible odds.And my disinterest in science is more than made up for by my love for people. I love to study individuals: their emotions and their surroundings and how they handled the challenges that faced them. All of history (my favorite subject in school!) is a tale of individuals doing amazing things, both good and bad, in ways that ripple through time. Headstrong is like a mini-history book, a snapshot of 52 different women whose accomplishments rippled through all of pop culture as well as the world of science.By the end of the book the snippets begin to feel a bit repetitive, mainly because they're all so short they only focus on a few key features of each scientist's life. I think Headstrong would have been an even more fascinating read if it had gone into less scientists in more depth, instead of more scientists in less depth. But then, Headstrong is supposed to be a collection of snapshots, a sampling of sorts to introduce people to a wide variety of women scientists who made huge contributions to science. They're not supposed to be comprehensive portraits, they're just supposed to provide starting points for people to discover scientists they can read more about on their own. And as a sampler, a photo album, a compilation of sketches, and every other metaphor I've thrown around in this review, Headstrong is perfect for learning about some of the biggest players in modern science.Even though I still don't like studying science. Oh, well.Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book through the Blogging For Books program in exchange for an honest review."
