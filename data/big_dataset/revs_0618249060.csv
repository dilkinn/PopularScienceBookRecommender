Carson brings forth, without ever putting on alarmist garbs, all the horrors of the warfare that we have undertaken against ourselves. The book is of course outdated and most of the bigger concerns have been, if not addressed, at least taken seriously. But the true value of the book is in understanding how long a time frame has to elapse before such matters of truly catastrophic nature follows the process of scientific suspicion, investigation, verification, then the slow seepage into public consciousness, then the denialism and finally the first baby steps of public policy. Reading the book so many years after its intended audience we have to go beyond the book and apply the concern to the current issues that we face. It is not the facts or the issues that is important, it is the attitude that Carson endorses.With the potent weapons in our hands, can we still afford to be so lax in our reaction to life threatening dangers sneering in our face? Will nature be so forgiving next time around? As crude a weapon as the cave man’s club, the incomplete human knowledge has been hurled against the fabric of life without any consideration of the risks which is beyond our current understanding or technology to calculate."

To allow more mercury to be dumped into, for instance, my Great Lakes, is both homicidal and suicidal, that particular combination of arrogance and ignorance that characterizes ""our"" approach to the environment today. Read Rachel Carson to recall that getting back into the bars and back on the beaches and back to business as usual may not be the best central purpose for this year's Earth Day.“She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted”--Mitch McConnell, about Elizabeth Warren (and Rachel Carson, decades ago)Poisoning the Planet with Impunity [Part 2, 2017]“Man has lost the capacity to foresee and to forestall. He will end by destroying the earth”—Albert Schweitzer This lovely, eloquent, poetic book, published in 1962 and nominated for The National Book Award, was read to me by the woman who played the part of Rachel in the movie, Kaiulani Lee, in a gentle voice that belies the storm the book still faces even today. The book was written by a scientist, marine biologist Carson, who had written the perhaps more poetic and less scientific but also popular The Sea Around Us, published seven years before, and its successor, The Edge of the Sea. These books were essentially about the love of nature and “the sense of wonder” we need to appreciate the world around us.But Carson saw horrific, ignorant things happening to the environment in the fifties. She took four years to carefully research and document all across this country the poisoning of the country. Carson and her publisher braced themselves for the response they knew was surely coming. Even before publication they were sued by chemical companies, unsuccessfully, and were on publication almost immediately and relentlessly vilified by what was then Corporate Farming America [yes, the people who are now bringing the planet Frankenfood], something that has continued unabated to this day by an amalgamation of anti-environmental climate change deniers and so on. Hundreds of dollars then were spent by the chemical industry in an attempt to discredit the book and to malign the author—she was described as an ignorant and hysterical woman who wanted to turn the earth over to the insects.“The ‘control of nature’ is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modern and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth”—CarsonOccasionally there are books that change the world. One such book was Uncle Tom’s Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe that almost singlehandedly turned white women firmly against slavery by depicting the cruel sale of slave children taken from their mother. Silent Spring, similarly warns us of the health concerns for (especially) children, even warning of the possibility of future birth defects. Carson, a scientist writing in a popular science mode, carefully lays out the case against DDT and other indiscriminately sprayed chemicals that were destroying ecosystems, endangering lives. She made the link between these poisons and cancer and other man-made diseases. As a direct result of the message in Silent Spring, President Kennedy set up a special panel to study the problem of pesticides. Though it took ten years to do it, DDT (and many other poisons) was banned in 1972. Carson with Silent Spring almost singlehandedly ushered in the environmental movement based on her study of 1950’s pesticide. We would not have had the EPA without Carson, possibly. When I was a kid in the sixties we drove through a putrid fog from Grand Rapids to Chicago. We swam in Lake Michigan in the midst of dead fish. I doubt you could swim in the lake on the Chicago side. Lake Erie was a dumping latrine. But beginning in the mid-sixties we turned around the destruction of the environment, though it in truth that destruction was just slowed down, as you know. The world’s oceans have raised a frightening 2 degrees in just the past fifty years. And so on. “We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost’s familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road—the one ‘less traveled by’—offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of our earth.”--CarsonTo those of you romanticizing deregulation (freedom from the oppressive state, let’s support Big Biz Profits instead of protecting Greedy Poor People and the environment, right on), and the roll back of The Clean Water Act:http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/f7047...Because we need more Flints, and see what, years later, is still unfolding as we see the criminals flee to the gutters as we find and expose their self-serving and murderous emails.Save the planet, I say. Prove Schweitzer wrong. Vote for the planet and take to the streets."
2,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,5,"This is a classic. It has not lost its validity. It has an important global message still today, 54 years after publication. Everyone should read this at least once. This reads as a horror story, but it is true. -The scientific studies are numerous, clear and to the point.-The demise of habitats and living creatures are lyrically depicted. -The author expertly alternates between poetic expression and scientific accuracy.-Eloquent prose. That’s the essential.Carson shows through carefully identified and quantified examples the inherent danger of pesticides, that they not only do not work and that they have serious side effects. She goes one step further and identifies better alternatives - biotic controls. Here is what I wish. I wish another author would follow up her analyses and describe how pesticides and herbicides are used today. Furthermore it would be interesting to know whether her suggestions concerning alternative methods have come to fruition. The audiobook narration by Kaiulani Lee was superb! Perfect speed, perfect intonation and performed with a poetic lilt when the lines so demanded. Beautifully and masterfully performed."
3,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,5,"How could I forget the first book I read about pesticides, and how they are destroying our planet? Rachel Carson is literally my hero. After reading Carson's book, I decided this is what I wanted to do with my life. I spent many years in the field of environmental geology, and I have her to thank. I believe this book is as relevant today as it was when she wrote it in 1962. She has an ease of writing, that not only expresses her deep concerns for the environment, but also feels highly personal. Her love of nature shines through on every page. Time has surely been the test of her writing, as I look around today and see what profound affects these chemicals have had on our world, our planet, and our health. It is fascinating to read of one highly intelligent woman's concerns for the future, and how we had the opportunity to act years ago. As fascinating a read now as it was then. Highly recommended."
4,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"""We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's poem, they are not equally fair. The road we are travelling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road - the one 'less travelled by' - offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of our earth"". (p.240)I found Rachel Carson's famous  Silent Spring a beautifully written book, that in the breadth of its interests (ecological collapse, cancer, invasive species, toxic build ups in the environment, natural defences against pests and so on) reminded me of Darwin.A while back I read Elizabeth Kolbert's book  The Sixth Extinction, while both cover similar ground - a testament to the lack of impact of Carson's book, Kolbert's prose style suggested that she was a journalist covering a story, and once she was done she would bugger off back to her own planet and leave us to it. Carson I felt, was in contrast, entirely committed and in awe of the complexities of ecology, of the web of life, although at the end I felt she was probably too optimistic in her faith in supporting natural predators, and probably too in the power of changing public opinion. While it is often enough said that the banning of DDT is attributable to Carson's book she herself is clear that already in the 1950s DDT was of of rapidly declining value because of the development of resistant insect populations.Reading, all the stories she was telling about pesticide resistance, invasive species, unintended consequences of chemical use, the discovery of chemicals in the fatty tissues of creatures in remote from where the chemicals had been used were all very familiar to me from repeated news stories, again suggesting to me that Carson's big point was ignored. This is not really a book about specific chemical usage in the years up to the publication of this book (1962) it is more about human attitudes towards nature. It reminded me too of the Vietnam war - not because of the use of herbicides - but because of the technological mindset, that by deploying enough technology you could get what you wanted. The issue of whether the technology was appropriate to the task, or if the situation could be sufficiently well understood by those who controlled the technology, whether those people understood themselves sufficiently and their powerlessness in the face of the world, were all taboo. After reading Herland I wondered too that if this book had been written instead by Rachel's fictional but no less talented brother Billy, maybe it might have been taken more seriously and maybe the USA might even have adopted the precautionary principal."
5,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"I picked this up because it's a a classic of American nature and environmental writing, and ostensibly marks the beginning of American environmental activism in the modern sense (i.e. more ""we deserve not to be poisoned"" than ""leisure grounds for posterity""). I found the rhetorical style interesting. She breaks the book up into chapters on where toxins come from, how they accumulate and spread, and what effects they have on wildlife, food, and human health. In each, she offloads tale after tale of dead birds, poisoned farm workers, and nearly inhuman acts of government negligence and the corporations that facilitate them. I found this droning repetition of evidence boring, a dull and depressing tirade, but I suppose that kind of argumentative overload has power, if not appeal.I felt some of her language and opinions were surprisingly dated. She often referred to insects using words like ""horde"" and militaristic symbols of weaponry and defense. Here’s an example from p. 246: ""the broader problem [...:] is the fact that our chemical attack is weakening the defenses inherent in the environment itself, defenses designed to keep the various species in check. Each time we breach these defenses a horde of insects pours through."" There are a couple odd implications here, like nature being a ""designed"" clockwork system of checks and balances, and insects as a kind of evil constantly trying to overthrow it. Of course, further down the page she writes, ""The balance of nature is not a status quo; it is fluid, ever shifting, in a constant state of adjustment."" The two statements seem at odds, and the bulk of the book effuses the latter sentiment, but I found it strange that she would occasionally be so careless with her language. I pick nits, of course, but perhaps it demonstrates that this book lies at a transition between American attitudes toward nature.I was also intrigued by her almost unconditional support of biological control techniques over pesticides (generally, the use of cultivated predators to control a pest population), readily advocating the importation of effective predators with (I think) no examples of the kinds of ecological disaster that can ensue when such tactics are pursued without very careful consideration (cane toads, anyone?). Again, perhaps a sign of the times.All in all, certainly worth my time. I'd like to read some more analysis on the book and on Carson herself (the preface to this editions is great), and I'm very keen to read her natural history writing, esp. on marine life."
6,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma,5,"5★+! Reposted in honour of her 111th birthday!David Attenborough said that after Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Silent Spring was probably the book that changed the scientific world the most.Why? Because marine biologist Rachel Carson explains in no uncertain terms exactly how mankind was changing the natural world for the worse in unimagined ways through pesticide use. Agriculture wasn’t concerned with wildlife or waterways, just livestock and crops.I remember as a child hearing that DDT was so safe you could sprinkle it on your cornflakes. A couple of decades later we were told pretty much the same thing about Roundup, a herbicide, not a pesticide, which has also fallen into serious disrepute recently.I understand it was the editors who recommended that Carson add an opening chapter. She wrote “A Fable for Tomorrow”, and what a chapter it is!“There was once a town in the heart of America where all life seemed to live in harmony with its surroundings. The town lay in the midst of a checkerboard of prosperous farms, with fields of grain and hillsides of orchards where, in spring, white clouds of bloom drifted above the green fields. . . Even in winter, the roadsides were places of beauty, where countless birds came to feed on the berries and on the seed heads of the dried weeds rising above the snow.”Then, it all changed. Mysteriously, things began sickening: streams, plants, animals, people. The songbirds are gone, the fish are gone. “A grim spectre has crept upon us almost unnoticed, and this imagined tragedy may easily become a stark reality we all shall know.”She does say that this is just a representation of any of a number of towns in the world, and she knows of no single town that’s lost everything. (Well, back in 1962, anyway.)“What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America? This book is an attempt to explain.”With that simple chapter, we get it. The enormity of what’s at stake.Thus began today’s environmental movement. There have always been conservationists and environmentalists, but this book gave them a voice and opened the eyes of the rest of us.And explain she does, clearly, factually, fascinatingly, and she includes the anecdotal stories we still seem to need to grab our attention. Much of what she describes is now part of the regular school curriculum, and there are lots of mainstream articles about soil health, microbes, worms and the interrelationship between even the smallest parts of nature.Some of her examples have a horrible fascination where they describe the unintended consequences of wiping out one pest intentionally which either kills other things or facilitates the spread of another, worse pest. In Clear Lake, California, they were spraying annoying gnats with DDD, a close relative of DDT but supposedly less harmful to fish. By the third season they sprayed, they were losing birds and discovered the build-up in fatty tissues. How? Why?Well, grebes eat fish, which eat other fish which eat plankton . . . and this stuff keeps building up.""One, a brown bullhead, had the astounding concentration of 2500 parts per million. It was a house-that-jack-built sequence, in which the large carnivores had eaten the smaller carnivores, that had eaten the herbivores, that had eaten the plankton, that had absorbed the poison from the water.""The last chapter, “The Other Road” refers to the famous Robert Frost poem, “The Road Not Taken”. Carson explains that our two roads are not equal. The way we’re going is fast and easy but leads to disaster.“The other fork of the road—the one ‘less travelled by’—offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of our earth. The choice, after all, is ours to make.”She holds out hope for more biological solutions and says (in 1962) many specialists are working on this in their respective fields: biology, entomology, biochemistry, genetics, too many to enumerate.She quotes professor Carl P. Swanson, a Johns Hopkins biologist:""'Any science may be likened to a river. It has its obscure and unpretentious beginning; its quiet stretches as well as its rapids; its periods of drought as well as of fullness. It gathers momentum with the work of many investigators and as it is fed by other streams of thought; it is deepened and broadened by the concepts and generalizations that are gradually evolved.'""Why haven’t we learned yet? It’s hard to believe that we have celebrated the 50th anniversary of this book without demanding our governments respect independent scientific reports and give corporate lobbyists the short shrift they deserve. What will be left of the world on its 100th anniversary, I wonder?This is an everybody-should-read-this book!"
7,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction concerning the harmful effects that chemicals, which were created to make life easier for man (pesticides, weed killers, etc.) have on the environment. This was first published in 1962 and the author is credited for opening the door on his topic. However, even now, 55 years later, it is still considered a hot topic. Great strides have been made in this arena, but vigilance must me constant. While reading this, I kept thinking that ignorance is bliss ONLY for those who don't have to pay the price. This book made me rethink my own gardening and lawn habits....what I should or should not use to curb weeds and crabgrass. Definitely food for thought."
8,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Advocacy is tricky. When you’re trying to motivate people to take action, you need to decide whether to appeal to the head, to the heart, to some combination of the two, or perhaps to some more delicate faculty. Upton Sinclair miscalculated when he wrote The Jungle, aiming for the heart but instead hitting the stomach; and as a result, the book was interpreted as an exposé of the meat industry rather than a plea for the working poor. Aldo Leopold, in A Sand County Almanac, eschews appeals to expediency, and instead focuses on the spiritual joys of wild nature; but his book didn’t result in any legislation. Rachel Carson seems to have found the right formula: an urgent and multifaceted appeal to self-interest. Silent Spring is often grouped along with Jane Jacobs’s The Death and Life of Great American Cities, which came out just the year before, in 1961. The comparison is apt, for both books were written by academic outsiders, by women working independently in male-dominated fields, and both books created a sensation. In subject matter, too, the books are surprisingly close. Jacobs describes how top-down city planning, which doesn’t take into account the needs of city-dwellers or the complex economies of cities, only causes ruination. Carson describes how indiscriminate use of pesticides destroys ecosystems and fails even to permanently kill the pests. Both books, in other words, criticize a practice taken for granted, a practice that attempted to mold the world using brute force while remaining ignorant of the systems it attempted to shape. Even today, Carson’s book retains its moral urgency and its morbid fascination. Not only is Carson a knowledgeable scientist, but she is quite a gifted author. She knows how to drive home her point using vivid—and often frightening—examples, detailing case after case of poisonings, in animals and humans. And she supplements her examples with scientific explanations, showing us how poisons spread through the environment, are absorbed into the body, and disrupt natural processes. She knew that the chemical industry was going to fight her tooth and nail, so she did not leave any stones unturned in her research. She systematically goes through the effects of pesticides on soil, water, birds, and plants, offering case after case in support of her thesis. Now that we take it for granted that pesticides shouldn’t be applied with such wholesale zeal, this can actually be a little tedious. When advocacy is effective, it renders itself obsolete.  But Carson does not make the mistake of focusing only on the environment. She emphasizes again and again how pesticides can enter foods, can combine in the body, can kill livestock and desolate fish, can enter the skin through commercial lawn products—in other words, she emphasizes that this problem is not abstract and distant, but is one that closely affects the reader. It is this focus that makes the book so effective: she appeals to the stomach, the heart, the head, and also to Aldo Leopold’s spiritual values—but most of all, she appeals to self-interest, the strongest motivator of all."
9,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"One person alone can achieve anything if there is a dedicated public behind it.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.It is inspiring to see what a human with a vision has achieved on his own. The book has changed the behavior of one of the most influential governments in the world. Although only in the short term and partly, but at least.More than half a century after its publication, politics and the economy are still downplaying poison and death. With borderline arguments and ideas. For example, that without toxic sprays the erosion would wash away the earth. They design lists and concepts that assign economic benefits to natural spaces and the forms of life they contain. It is determined which animals die out and which one get a place in the ark.Too small areas are designated as nature reserves. If not the stress kills the animals, the incest does. There are still many similar stylistic blossoms in the environmental policy and the recommendations of Ministries of Agriculture.A person's initiative is an indictment of those who say they can not do anything. They say that one vote would not be worth anything in an election or an action would be just a frustrating waste of time. Earlier, the argument may have voted on several points. The media were even more monopolized and the reporting heavily censored. Also, people were so conservative that it was easy to get massive personal and professional problems by violating opportunism. The opportunity to network with other like-minded people was sparse. Only in the 21st century, these justifications are obsolete and cheap.Today, social media and the global cooperation of NGOs and civic movements can and will achieve much more. That there is still a long way to go is another matter. It is easy to blame the adolescent and young adults for not engaging. Many never get in closer contact with the subject via their environment and traditional media and therefore can not form a consciousness. The fact that they are deprived of and hidden from opportunities to engage is societies fault.Much more is the raised index finger is to be paned in the direction of the teachers and parents. Comparing the environmentally conscious, engaging parents with the consumptive and indifferent legal guardians, the picture reveals itself. The children imitate this behavior. Even in puberty.The classic problem is that one does not believe what one does not see. Pollution and environmental degradation have been exported to the large, visible parts to developing countries. There, the companies do not even have to bother to conceal or simulate waste separation. You can dump any waste anywhere.When pollution is reported in wealthy industrialized countries, the positive achievements of recent decades are overemphasized. As it has become an important economic factor to prevent environmental damage, this is also true for Western democracies. It is cheaper to take precautions than to repair the massive damage.Corporations often manage to shirk legal claims or bankruptcies of a subsidiary before paying damages. However, as the focus of public attention has become stronger, it is increasingly difficult. On the other hand, if the illegal landfill is in faraway countries, it does not affect people. In combination with lack of coverage the perfect mix to silence.The idea of environmental protection should not be limited to a furry animal or one's own country. The consciousness that everything is a single, interlinked cycle must be awakened. A planet, not separate and independent worlds.Ein Mensch alleine kann doch alles erreichen, wenn eine engagierte Öffentlichkeit dahinter steht.Es ist inspirierend, was ein Mensch mit einer Vision alleine zustande gebracht hat. Durch das Buch wurde das Verhalten einer der mächtigsten Regierungen der Welt nachhaltig geändert. Zwar nur kurzfristig und teilweise, aber immerhin.Über ein halbes Jahrhundert nach der Veröffentlichung entblöden sich Politik und Wirtschaft noch immer, Gift und Tod zu verharmlosen. Mit grenzdebilen Argumentationen und Ideen. Etwa dass ohne Spritzmittel die Erosion die Erde wegwaschen würde. Sie entwerfen Listen und Konzepte, die Naturräumen und darin enthaltenen Lebensformen wirtschaftliche Nutzwerte zuordnen. Es wird bestimmt, welche Tiere aussterben und welche man erhält. Viel zu kleine Areale werden als Naturschutzgebiete ausgewiesen. Wenn nicht der Stress die Tiere tötet, dann der Inzest. In der Umweltschutzpolitik und den Empfehlungen von Landwirtschaftsministerien gibt es noch viele Stilblüten. Die Initiative eines Menschen ist ein Armutszeugnis für alle, die sagen, sie könnten nichts zustande bringen. Ihre Stimme wäre bei einer Wahl nichts wert oder ihre Initiative nur eine frustrierende Zeitverschwendung. Früher mag das Argument in einigen Punkten gestimmt haben. Die Medien waren monopolisiert und die Berichterstattung stark zensiert. Auch waren die Menschen so konservativ, dass man mit Verstößen gegen den Opportunismus leicht massive private und berufliche Probleme bekommen konnte. Die Möglichkeit, sich mit anderen Gleichgesinnten zu vernetzten, waren spärlich. Nur im 21 Jahrhundert sind diese Rechtfertigungen obsolet und billig. Heute kann und wird man mit sozialen Medien und globaler Kooperation von NGOs und Bürgerbewegungen noch viel mehr erreichen. Dass noch ein weiter Weg zu gehen ist, steht auf einem anderen Blatt. Es fällt leicht, den Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen vorzuwerfen, sie würden sich nicht engagieren. Viele kommen über ihr Umfeld und klassische Medien nie näher mit der Thematik in Kontakt und können sich daher kein Bewusstsein bilden. Dass ihnen die Möglichkeiten, sich zu engagieren, von der Gesellschaft vorenthalten und vertuscht werden, ist deren Schuld. Viel mehr ist der erhobene Zeigefinger in Richtung der Lehrer und Eltern zu schwenken. Vergleicht man die umweltbewussten, sich engagierenden Eltern mit den konsumierenden und teilnahmslosen Erziehungsberechtigten, offenbart sich das Bild. Die Kinder imitieren dieses Verhalten. Selbst in der Pubertät. Ein klassisches Problem ist, dass man nicht glaubt, was man nicht sieht. Die Umweltverschmutzung und Umweltzerstörung wurde zu großen, sichtbaren Teilen in die Entwicklungsländer exportiert. Dort müssen sich die Konzerne nicht einmal die Mühe machen, etwas zu kaschieren oder Mülltrennung zu simulieren. Sie können jeglichen Abfall beliebig irgendwohin kippen. Wenn in den reichen Industriestaaten auf die Umweltverschmutzung verwiesen wird, werden die positiven Errungenschaften der letzten Jahrzehnte überbetont. Da es ein wichtiger Wirtschaftsfaktor geworden ist, Umweltschäden lieber zu verhindern, stimmt das für die westlichen Demokratien auch. Es ist billiger, Vorsorge zu treffen, als die massiven Schäden beheben zu müssen. Konzerne schaffen es zwar häufig, sich mittels juristischer Winkelzüge oder auch Insolvenzen eines Tochterunternehmens vor den Schadenersatzzahlungen zu drücken. Aber da der Fokus der öffentlichen Aufmerksamkeit stärker geworden ist, wird es zunehmend immer schwieriger. Sind die Schäden hingegen in weit entfernten Ländern, affektiert es die Menschen nicht. In Kombination mit nicht vorhandener Berichterstattung die perfekte Mischung zum Totschweigen.Der Umweltschutzgedanke darf nicht auf ein pelziges Tier oder das eigene Land beschränkt werden. Es muss das Bewusstsein erwachen, dass alles ein einziger, verzahnter Kreislauf ist. Ein Planet, nicht von sich getrennte und unabhängige Welten."
10,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58882300-valliya-rennell,2,"2 starsDNF @ 35%Welcome to Quickie Review with Valliya, a new series of reviews that I am starting if I don't feel like writing a review, but still have some thoughts so I talk about them in a quick and concise manner :DI can see why Rachel Carson's novel Silent Spring was so influential: it is easy to read and to understand. The opening 'story' about a town where suddenly everything dies and peoples' lives become miserable paints a wonderful and devastating picture while sucking the reader in. What follows is not as great. Every chapter reads exactly the same. Yes, there variations in the topic (pesticide affecting fish vs birds vs soil vs plants), but when you keep going over and over in circles, I am going to get bored. I decided to DNF because after reading the first 100 pages, I came to understand I would get the same point reiterated over and over and over. This can be done in an engaging way (ex. Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond), but it wasn't so in this book. For the relatively uneducated public, this method did wonders to bring awareness and outcry and start the environmental movement, on the other hand, I see why critics thought Carson was obsessed with this topic and over exaggerating (for the record, I disagree, but I see where they're coming from). Most importantly though, this book did scare the hell out of me, so please guys care for the planet. So great job, Ms. Carson, you have made me an environmentalist even though I didn't get through your book.Thank you all for joining in for episode 1 of Quickie Review with Valliya!Next episode: Sharp Objects - Gillian Flynn ★★★"
11,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73266776-tatsuhiro-sato,4,"A book written more than 50 years but still stands true. Written mainly about chemicals, fertilisers and their affects in United States, many of these chemicals mentioned are now banned but also new , powerful and more dangerous chemicals have been introduced in our environment. Surely this book is hard to review as it covers a lot of scientific information on chemicals and their hazardous affects on man, animals, food and on the earth as a whole. So many animals, insects, crops have been mentioned in this book and how chemicals almost made them vanish or useless.But in all this book tell us how in the race of economic growth and development with the help of science had lead to much more bigger concerns where our future is at stake. Science is nice but mixed with Human greed has lead to many disasters. In developing countries like India these issues are very far from public discussion while everyday these chemicals are killing us in many different ways.Progress is important but the cost at which it is achieved must be reassessed else our future is bleak."
12,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,3,"Indeed and both content and writing style wise, Rachel Carson’s seminal and oh so important for the environmental movement Silent Spring generally reads both flowingly and with graceful, understated (but also emotionally textually dense) eloquence (but yes and sadly, after more than fifty years since the 1964 publication of Silent Sprung, there not only still remains very much to be done with regard to stopping or at least severely limiting overusing pesticides but it also does seem that in recent years, it certainly is beginning to feel as though we are in fact moving not really forwards but actually rather backwards, that we are often drowning out Rachel Carson’s important messages and admonishments and catering to special interest groups like farming and industrial lobbies and indeed not in any manner further reducing but sadly increasing pesticide and herbicide production and usage once again). However, as much as I do wholeheartedly applaud Rachel Carson for having penned Silent Spring and that yes indeed, this book really was a major wake-up call with regard to especially how DDT was thinning and making fragile bird eggs and thus severely and lastingly reducing the ability for birds to successfully procreate and reproduce, as an academic, I do have to (even if contritely and with a bit of guilt) point out that Rachel Carson NOT using any foot or endnotes in her text, in the narrative of Silent Spring and just listing her diverse sources by chapter and as far as I can tell a bit haphazardly at that, this certainly does not make for easy supplemental research. And yes, even figuring out from which of the listed sources Rachel Carson has gleaned her information and where in her text, where in Silent Spring this is all located is in my opinion and very much frustratingly rendered considerably more difficult without foot or endnotes (not to mention that Silent Spring also does not contain an all encompassing and separate bibliography either, just these rather difficult to weed through source lists at the end of each chapter, a to and for me academic shortcoming that while it does not in any manner diminish Silent Spring’s and Rachel Carson’s message, it has definitely frustrated me on an academic and university/college research level)."
13,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update May2018 A couple of good articles about the book were recently brought to my attention. The WSJ one is here:https://www.wsj.com/articles/silent-s...You need a subscription to read this, but basically it does a good job of putting her book in context....Carson’s assault on pesticides and herbicides shocked 1962 Americans, who generally viewed these chemicals as the latest marvels from the awesome scientists whose previous inventions had won World War II. Consumer advertisements extolled the benefits of installing DDT-impregnated wallpaper for the nursery, spraying babies with insecticide before letting them out in the sun and soaking farmers’ fields in pesticides......“Silent Spring” is remembered as an attack on DDT specifically, but Carson actually wrote about many products, presenting evidence that industrial bug- and weed-killers could upset entire ecosystems.......One chemical firm threatened to sue...Carson was a “hysterical female,” a “bird and bunny lover,” even a communist....They also point out some issues, though. ...Carson’s claims about the direct risks pesticides and herbicides pose to human health do not stand up as well. Here again, she describes the science of the era accurately—problem is, the science in this area wasn’t especially good... I found it a good, balanced article & highly recommend it.The Daily Beast did one titled ""How Rachel Carson Cost Millions of People Their Lives"" about the unintended consequences. It's here:https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-rac...It's also wrong on several points. It makes no mention of the enormous toll DDT took on birds. https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar...It almost caused the extinction of Bald Eagles.Also, as the WSJ article above points out, ...Carson’s detractors accuse her of misrepresenting the science. Wrong: Carson wrote that pesticides and herbicides disorder ecosystems because they kill broad swathes of their inhabitants, and predicted this would lead to entirely new problems as previously rare survivor species suddenly exploded in number. This has been borne out repeatedly. Carson also said that repeatedly applying pesticides and herbicides would cause their targets to evolve immunity to them. Alas, this, too, has been borne out repeatedly.The latter process is one reason why the DDT ban did not, in fact, lead to many malaria deaths. To begin with, DDT was banned only for agricultural use; its use for preventing disease was not affected. And most countries gave up on DDT not because of any ban but because it no longer worked—mosquitoes evolved to resist it. India kept on spraying after “Silent Spring”: Today the malaria mosquitoes across more than three-quarters of that nation are immune to DDT. ...All in all, I found this article pretty much garbage. It cherry-picked to make a point & completely ignores the times.Nov 2008: I've re-read this after maybe 30 years & it is still scary. It is a classic environmental book, detailing how we're changing our ecology & poisoning it. How long the effects linger is just scary & the links to cancer is horrifying. She occasionally goes over the top, but most often makes good points on how our current practices of bludgeoning nature into our ideal form - which is often mistaken - is not working well & will eventually spell our doom. It was written over 45 years ago &, while a little dated, is still one of the best books I've read on the subject. It's amazing that we are still using some of the chemicals she shows so much evidence against using. Her well documented atrocities that our government has perpetrated against us are chilling. I never trusted the government all that much but trust them even less now."
14,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/816678-sarah-enescu,3,"I have a personal rule when reading books. If I am not completely absorbed into it within fifty pages I put it down. This rule doesn’t work well for assigned reading, and fifty pages into Silent Spring I was so bored I was spending more time thinking of ways to avoid reading the book than actually reading it. Finally it occurred to me the reasons why I felt this boredom. After all, the book is not boring, Carson writes with a feverish passion towards defending nature that simply following her choice of verbs is intriguing. Anything relative to wildlife and plants are written with a frilly dreamlike flow of words, as if she is trying to conjure up a still image from a Disney animation. The moment man and pesticides are brought into context all flow ends and she writes in stark single word descriptions. It very effectively shows what side she is defending. This is when I realized what I was missing, which was causing my boredom. This is a very old book. Approaching this book to learn the obvious intentions was not a wise path for me. I needed to look at this book as a piece of history, a landmark to understand why we are where we are in our agricultural systems. Silent Spring was a success, and because all the various evidence that she uses in her book are examples I was strongly familiar with, solidly shows what type of impact her argument made. I found the book to be very narrow minded. It was truly a cry, every page being a diatribe of complaints, never offering solid solutions. Yet, she consistently used that approach throughout the book making the reader create a deep sorrow for her, maybe even pity towards what she felt was being lost. If she were to offer two sides, or a bigger picture, she would not have come across so in need and injured. Less people would wanted to help in her quest for change. So, she kept this consistency by forming her arguments with great vagueness and working on the fears already established by people. She vaguely shares that the DDT founder won a Nobel Prize, but never that DDT was awarded that prize for saving lives in the World War I, in the area of medicine. She takes arsenic, a toxic element, and describes how it is found in increased amounts in our soil, leading to increased content in tobacco. She knows the association that people have with arsenic being a poison, but is it not also an essential element to man and plants? And where were the epidemic proportions of deaths associated with this increase? She has no need to answer these questions. Throughout the first third of the book she successfully chooses examples that the reader is already afraid of and lures them in from this to increase her credibility. I don’t condemn it I cheer her for it. This is the type of extremism that when a person is subjected to it they can simply put the book down if they don’t like it. Today, we are all very fortunate that people did not put down the book. Throughout the rest of the book I shook my head, thinking of all her over the top accusations toward increased pesticide use, but no mention of modes of action. The academic standpoint she has as a biologist, yet she has never attempted to empathize with the American farmer. The way that she never references what was happening historically in our nation at that time that was putting the demand upon farmers for feeding more people. That was the era of baby boomer, no? I thank her for her voice and how it has brought about a stronger focus on responsible agricultural practices. However, I hope that others that read this book recognize it’s age, and use the examples she documents as milestones to measure how far away from that type of system we have come. Her crying and negativity don’t solve problems. She has attacked the practices, and people responded. Today the majority of the insecticides she references are already removed or nearly removed from use today. We no longer need her narrow approach and acknowledging the date of print of her message is vital for people that are moved by it to see it as the birth of a crusade, but not the bible. "
15,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"In 1962, a scientist named Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring detailing the hazardous environmental effects of pesticides and herbicides being used in the United States. She wrote with factual accuracy that urgently detailed the horrific implications of prolonged chemical use, and with beautiful prose that framed this work in her undeniable love of nature. And the kicker is that people actually listened to her. Reading this book in 2019, it seems sadly nostalgic to look back at a time when the general public actually gave credence to the work of researchers and scientific fact. Wacky. Rachel Carson undeniably succeeds in reporting objectively unromantic evidence (scary stuff really), with an execution conveying a soft aesthetic style rarely seen with popular science authors. She expresses beautiful sentiments such as, “in nature nothing exists alone,” (51) that will appeal to anyone’s inner hippie. Then in the same paragraph, she will also account how arsenic leached in the soil and water will have detrimental effects the public’s health for generations to come (aka: cancer). All things are connected, which is both beautiful and horrifying when you think about it, and Rachel Carson will really make you think about it. Overall, this book is pretty great, I definitely recommend it. "

18,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"I came across a reference to this book a while back. It was in a booklet about climate change, and it said there that Rachel Carson was responsible for millions of lives lost to malaria. The writer of the booklet claimed these deaths occurred because Silent Spring killed off the use of DDT to fight mosquitos that spread malaria. This caught my attention because even though I had heard about Carson, and Silent Spring before, I had never heard about this. So I finally got around to reading Silent Spring to try to see why he would make these claims.Silent Spring is in parts truly beautifully written, it has poetic descriptions, and I now really get why Carson was such a popular science writer in her time. She presents the science in a understandable terms, and there is a pretty consistent flow through out the work. The whole thing is backed up with reference to scientific studies of the period. Basically, she was a good science writer that could write for the general public. What she is advocating in this work, is the responsible use of pesticides, unlike the massive over use that was unfortunately the case in some places at that time. She never asked for a total ban of DDT, but a more responsible use of it, and she pointed out different pest control methods that might be used in agriculture. Eventually the use of DDT was banned in agriculture in the US, and other places around the world. But the use of DDT in anti-malaria spraying has never been banned. Let me repeat that, the use of DDT is a legal way to fight against malaria, and has been ever since this book was first published. So even though Rachel Carson talked about the negative sides to DDT, and other such pesticides control in Silent Spring, that didn’t cause those millions of deaths from malaria. It’s a classic work in environmental literature, and I’m glad I finally read it. I think I should even thank the writer that attacked Rachel Carson in his booklet for getting me to finally read it. Some of the science may be dated by now, but you have to remember it was published in 1962, so it’s not going to be up to date with the latest scientific studies. But the main point of this book, that we should not abuse nature, still stands up to scrutiny. Silent Spring may now mostly be of historical importance, but I would still recommend it to people that are interested in environmental writing."
19,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122465-jordan-berg,5,"I wish this book was not still so poignant. But this book that really started the modern environmental movement and rose the consciences of millions of Americans is still as important today as it was 45 years ago. Whether it’s the use of chemicals still sprayed into are yards and on our food today, or lessons on the importance of questioning how our actions affect our world, Rachel Carson broke the mold. Every person needs to read this book. “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America? This book is an attempt to explain.” This book will seep into your consciousness and never leave. Its far to important today with global warming, our fossil fuel addiction, and the chemicals that you ingest every day for you NOT to read this book. "
20,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373639-janet,5,"What is there to add to the universal praise for Rachel Carson? This book isn't a walk in the park, and it's crammed with (accesible) Scientific data, but it changed the world. I was more fascinated by Carson's rhetoric than in her findings, which are now more than 45 years old. I read this book to learn how she built a case that challenged every major scientific, political and corporate institution in the country. And she did it by connecting with the shared values of average Americans. Bravo, Rachel!"
21,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana,5,"Rachel Carson is a feminist hero. In a world of science beholden to capitalist interests and run by men, she defied all conventions in publishing this non-academic yet copiously researched expose on Big-Ag and the effects of pesticide use. She was decried from all angles, not least of all by the scientific establishment, which derided her ""pop science"" approach and her ""hysterical feminine"" tone. But it was too late - Carson had appealed to the public, and the public-and their representatives- listened. Congressional investigations were initiated, entire government agencies and departments were formed to address Carson's points, private groups mobilized to protect the environment, and on and on. They aren't kidding when they say Carson provided the spark for the modern environmental movement. As for the book itself: it is full of now outdated information, and is a bit dry, despite critics who sing Carson's praise as a lyrical writer. It's basically a catalogue of the effects of different kinds of pesticides at various levels (species, community, ecosystem) and on various organisms (from plants to ants to cattle to people). I wouldn't say I enjoyed reading it, but I can't rate this as lower than 5 stars due to its historical significance. Silent Spring's ""Fun to Read"" rating is probably between a 2 and a 5, depending on how interested you are in the environmental movement and food sourcing."
22,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22102437-don-gagnon,5,"“Sharing our earth with other creatures” (Rachel Carson) . . . “Silent Spring” (1962) by Rachel Carson (1907-1964) was the culmination of the poet scientist’s campaign against indiscriminate use of synthetic biocides to control disease carrying insects and agricultural pests at the expense of the destruction of the natural world and subjecting human beings to neurological damage, malignancy, and death. Carson asked,  “How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”In the highly influential book, the author eloquently and systematically presented her appeal for clarity, humility, and responsibility in human efforts to control specific pests. Carson encouraged the use of biological measures that exploit the natural weaknesses of harmful species rather than the use of violently poisonous chemicals that eliminate natural checks and balances and expose all plants, animals, and humans to carcinogens and other toxins.56 years after the original publication of “Silent Spring”, Rachel Carson’s legacy endures in the work of responsible scientists, the commitment of environmental advocates, and the annual celebration of Earth Day.So, . . . Happy Earth Day! Although I didn’t plan to finish reading “Silent Spring” on Earth Day, I can’t imagine a better day to do so."
23,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25041256-joanna-hartell,4,"I thought this would be very outdated, but in fact I didn't think it was. It was historical in a way, and I would like to read an update on the science and a more recent history of our use of pesticides, and the banning (or not) of the ones she mentions. I think we still face many or all of the problems Carson talks about, and global warming as well. When I hear now that a bunch of birds are found dead, like all the redwing blackbirds that died in the south a few years ago, I have no doubt it is from a chemical, or pesticide release. Perhaps Kolbert's 'The Sixth Extinction' is the follow up book to Silent Spring- but I do still want a specific update to Carson's book, point by point. I think this book would be on my must read list."

The major chemical companies are pouring money into the universities to support research on insecticides. This creates attractive fellowships for graduate students and attractive staff positions. Biological-control studies, on the other hand, are never so endowed — for the simple reason that they do not promise anyone the fortunes that are to be made in the chemical industry. These are left to state and federal agencies, where the salaries paid are far less.
Should you take an ethics engineering course at UCLA, unless things have changed dramatically in the last six or so years, you will not read excerpts of this book or delve into the thought control machine that is university funding and other forms of capitalistic peer pressure. Instead, you will spend the majority of the time on the professor's old field of mainstream history, sprinkled with intermittent commentary on the military industrial complex birth of video games, Chernobyl, and the Ford Pinto, a car which had the tendency to lock up and catch fire upon exceeding 40 mph. The interesting thing about the last one, however, is how its creating company tried to prove it was more expensive to recall all the vehicles than to let the people burn. Hardly the most encouraging way of of developing a skilled toolkit for combating the banal evils of a discovery offered to the juggernaut idol of money making. If this is what one of the most renowned universities in the US and, perhaps, the world, has to offer, how are we training the young with their bright dreams and even brighter futures today? Are we training them in the field of development for the sake of all humanity, or in the art of human sacrifice?
[T]he goal of curing the victims of cancer is more exciting, more tangible, more glamorous and rewarding than prevention[.][T]he laws of science do not observe the boundaries of politics.
I'm aware of the flaws in Carson's thinking nearly sixty years after the fact. However, until someone pens a text as accessible and as concerned with the ethics of discovery and advancement as this one, this work is vital reading, especially in the days of STEM brainwashing and every excuse made for the sake of the money, the money, the money. Carson's evidence and source material bibliography are both vast, so while I don't completely trust her statistics (teaching SAT has made me especially keen on a text's openness about what they are comparing and what is constituting the parts of their wholes), I Do trust the paradigm she advocates for all the specifics of organic pesticides and toxic run off: cost is to be measured in morals, not dollar signs. I come away having learned something of the horrors that the 50s and early 60s had encouraged in the name of progress, but it didn't surprise me that the landscape of those decades' social justice relations were reflected in the murderous toxicity of the top dogs' relationships with nature. The more excuses one makes to dehumanize, the more the mentality of abuse spreads to all corners of one's personal philosophy, and destruction of the earth goes hand in hand with destruction of humanity, with all its logical fallacies (it's the average citizen who destroys more than the blundering corporation, as if 75% of water used in California, for example, wasn't used by companies rather than the state's population) and sanctioned insults (""hysterical"", ""emotion-fanning words"", ""priestess of nature""). There is no separation between a nation taking on responsibility for the ground it lives upon and the people whom it serves. One individual cannot maintain a country, but if more were like Rachel Carson and refused to go with a poisonous flow, there would be less attention paid to profit and more crying out against murder in all its forms.
Who would want to live in a world which is just not quite fatal?The trouble is that we are seldom aware of the protection afforded by natural enemies until it fails.
As a work, I'm grateful that this continues to be read. As a tract of science, I am less enamored with its achievements, as its worth lies not in its commentary on the numbers and figures of yester half century, but in the commentary and critique of the human soul which has evolved so slowly since the time before the written record. Greed for the quick buck and the thrilling massacre still fuels the science students and government grants of today in fields seemingly beyond the domain of environmentalism, and the complacent assumption of ""we are better than that now"" holds true neither in the corporate realms, nor in the political battlefields. It was terrifying back in Carson's day, and it is terrifying today for many of the same reasons. Whether we wipe ourselves out for the sake of the cold and unfeeling god of money remains to be seen.
The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized.

25,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/457755-mary-anne,4,"Silent Spring by Rachel Carson can be considered a pivotal work, and must reading for those who are concerned about the environment. Published in 1962, it has taken the rest of us a couple of generations to catch up to her understanding of ecological systems. A marine biologist by training, and also a writer of three other works, Silent Spring was not received with acclaim. Rather, she was accused of having no scientific basis for her findings. To my non-scientific reading, it seems like evidence enough for me. And that's just the point: she addressed this book to the general public, and hit a nerve.I admit that I skimmed some parts, particularly the technical sections. But the author does a great job of describing what happens to an ecosystem when you try to eradicate one bug species with DDT. As we now know, man's drive to tame our planet often backfires. And Carson was one of the first to point that out.Here in Pittsburgh, we are proud to point out that Rachel Carson came from a small town on then highly poluted Allegheny River, called Springdale. We even have a bridge named after her. Ironically, she was battling breast cancer while writing book. She died in 1964 at the age of 57."
26,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779598-pete-dapixie,4,"I had heard of Silent Spring for a long time, and when I stumbled upon it recently I knew right away I had to read this book. Rachel Carson wrote this when JFK was president, and he being the man he was took action straight away. The afterword, by Linda Lear was written in 98.I can't believe that a book dealing with hydrocarbons could be so poetically written and so clearly explained. I can't believe that I've read such a book. The case studies are, of course, from America in the main, and from way back in the 1950's., a time when ecology didn't even exist. However, this is still a green bible today and essential reading for those concerned with the environment of our world, and the actions of corporate insanity. "
27,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374336-erin,5," After being in the environmental field for 15 years, I decided it was about time to finish reading the book that started it all, at least what we know as the modern environmental movement (I won't get into what I think is happening in the environmental movement right now). If you are of my generation (thirtysomethings), you will probably start to read this and think ""Yea, Yea, I know all of this already"" because that's what I thought at first. But then it dawned on me that the reason ""I know all of this already"" is because of the impact this book had on the environmental culture of this country in the early 1960's, resulting in a greater awareness of how our actions impact our environment and legislation to regulate those actions.  This book deals with some pretty technical stuff (e.g. insecticide chemical disruption of the Kreb's cycle in the cells and the cascading effect to other tissues in an organism, not just in insects) and can be a little dry in some parts, but Carson does a good job of making it relevent to our understanding and appreciation of our environment. This is a great read for those who are interested in environmental history."
28,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,3,"A historically important book and it does contain very important information about pesticides and how their often unregulated and unwarranted use impacts wildlife and humanity. However, each part seems very repetitive, driving the same narrative over and over again, which significantly takes away from the readability. Pick up the foreword and any one single chapter, and you will get pretty much everything there’s to get out of Silent Spring. Impactful as a long essay, but tedious in its entirety."

It came out in the sixties and, though I don't actually know anything about anything, I'm pretty sure most of the problems Rachel Carson describes in Silent Spring have been dealt with. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), an infamous chemical used as a pesticide during the first half of the twentieth century, was banned in the US and most of the world, due in large part to Carson's book.But what makes this book great is its universalness. Yes, Carson focuses almost solely on the consequences of the use of chemicals in agricultural production, but its thesis can be reapplied to any time or situation; in fact, as technological developments increase exponentially, it becomes all the more important to ask Carson's question: how does this affect the environment, plants, animals, and even humans in both the short and long terms?But I can't leave this review on such an optimistic note. I don't believe that humanity as a whole is capable of asking itself questions like that and conforming to the honest answer. When farmers first began using pesticides, it wouldn't have taken much to ask themselves, ""is it really a good idea to spray poison all over my land?"" The obvious answer is ""no"". It doesn't take a genius to figure out that it will come back to bite you in the ass someday. But of course it's much easier to ignore those thoughts and get a pretty field of homogeneously green soybeans, empty of all insect life.Is it really a good idea to take oil out of the ground and burn three billion, five hundred and seventy million gallons of it per day? I mean, why do we pretend that there aren't going to be consequences for that? That after billions of years of existence, we can take a beautiful, green, lush planet and do whatever we want with it and think ""ahhh... everything's gonna be just fine"". But of course, we want what we want. It's cold out today, so I'm running my furnace. And I'm typing on a laptop and later I will drive my car to the grocery. As the wonderful Louis C.K. puts it, ""I wanna go faster... er, um... I'm not fast enough"".It's books like these that make me want to become a hunter-gatherer."

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban. This book is a wonderful balance of science (dated a bit now, but still good stuff) and engaging writing.If you can't tell, I'm a pretty big Rachel Carson fan.

33,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."

Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "
36,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,I am very glad that I finally read this classic. It is clear why this became such a game-changer in environmental awareness. Silent Spring is carefully researched and very convincing. It was a bit long-winded at times and I will admit that my attention sometimes wandered while listening to the audiobook.

She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil. Other plants which we may classify as weed (and ruthlessly eradicate) could be doing the same positive job.Blanket spraying can paradoxically leads to more weed as it clears the field for them.Nature should be observed and its ways of controlling vegetation.Lists examples where plant eating insects were used to get rid of weeds. Cheaper and environment friendly.Chapter 7: Needless HavocThe effect on animals. Witnesses should be those with proper training in the field i.e. biologist and without connections with companies (conflic of interest).Entomologists not trained and psychologically are not inclined to see the destruction.The Japanese Beetla and use of chemicals to kill it. Blanket use of Alldrin by airplanes. Results several days later with hell a lot of dead birds. Many other animals sick or dead. Many people sick.Similar other programs, most notably in Sheldon. Many wild animals and livestock died.East cost strategies were different from mid West, they used the natural enemies of the Japaneses beetles and this worked. This should have been replicated in mid West.It is morally wrong to kill thousands of wild animals, who die in agony for no reason.Chapter 8: And No Bird SingElm trees got a fungal disease from Europe called Dutch Elm disease. It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons. DDT for bud worm. Rain taking the pesticides down to the rivers. Factories emptying their pesticides intos rivers and gulfs. Details, similar in fashion to previous chapters.Research needs more fundingChapter 10: Indiscriminately from the skiesToday's poisons are much more dangerous yet instead of careful application to the target only like before we are sparying them indiscriminately from sky. Over fields and towns.The Jipsi moth. Blank spraying (of everything) instead of using natural killers. Court cases.The fire ant. Use of misleading propaganda.Milk with DDT sold in the market. Big mistakes made by a government agency. Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers. The government (FDA) protection for the public is very limited.Tolerance tests dor drugs do not take account the accumulative effect of ingesting so many source of DDT contaminated food. The tolerance for many types of pesticides in food should be brought downInspection is weak and non-existent in trade within the same state; this should be brought up.Chapter 12: The human price""Man, however much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature.""Poisons accumulate in adipose tissue and are drawn upon when fat is used such as when losing weight (diet regime or sickness).Effects on liver. General bad effects on humans. Patient cases and research findings.Chapter 13: Through a narrow windowWill go to a cellular level.Damages respiration cycle of the cell in mitochondria [Kerb cycle?]. ATP is the result. ATP & ADP.Bad effects of pesticide induced hypoxia (lack of ATP) on embryos at early stages of development (starting from sperms and eggs). Oligospermua.Pesticides (some) having a similar effect to radiation, they damage chromosomes and cause mutations. Needs further studying.Chapter 14: 1 in every 4Pesticide carcinogenic effect. Stories, research etc.Importance of prevention. Environmental prevention measures are better than any possible cures. We shoud eliminate carcinogens in food, water supply and air or reduce their impactChapter 15: Nature fights backInsects evolve resistance and fight back pesticides.Our chemicals destroy the natural defences against insects which are the most important in keeping insect numbers in check.Lists examples of these natural defenses and how the use of chemicals backfired due to their destruction.Examples of biological control, and how use of pesticides destroys their effective work done very cheaply.Speaks against ""economical"" entomologists.Chapter 16: The rumblings of an avalanche""If Darwin were alive today, the insect world would delight and astound him with its impressive verification of his theories of the survival of the fittest.""Evolution of resistance. Not many people understand this, and therefore they follow stupid strategies.This is a very serious issue, as serious as the atomic bomb!History of evolution of resistance to various types of pesticides. It evolves very fast, in months sometimes. Average 2-3 years. The other extreme is 6 years.Warns against the future if this is continued.Resistance developes not in an individual, but in oipulations over generations.Instructions to reduce evolution of resistance. At some places it went out of control. More and more people are realizing that biological control is needed and that chemical control is futile, short minded and lacks scientific insightChapter 17: The other roadBiological solutions may appear harder and slower at first, but on the long run they are the safest most reliable, last for much longer and are also cheaper.Sterilization with radiation if screwworm was very successful, exterminating them completely from the area.Research ongoing to find sterilization methods which are specific.Confusing the male gypsi moths and deceiving them by using female scent for sexual attraction. Sound (including ultrasound) can play an attractive/repellent role too.U/s as a weapon.Control of insects with microorganisms. Very specific.Conclusion""The ""control of nature"" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
40,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
41,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
42,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
43,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

45,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"

However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

51,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
52,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
53,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
54,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
55,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
56,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
57,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.
58,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book in its position as the historical spark for the contemporary environmental movement. At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "

So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban.

63,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."

Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "
66,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,I am very glad that I finally read this classic. It is clear why this became such a game-changer in environmental awareness. Silent Spring is carefully researched and very convincing. It was a bit long-winded at times and I will admit that my attention sometimes wandered while listening to the audiobook. 
67,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,3,"My notes while reading the book:Originated the modern environmental movement.Short summary of her and her book. She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil. Other plants which we may classify as weed (and ruthlessly eradicate) could be doing the same positive job.Blanket spraying can paradoxically leads to more weed as it clears the field for them.Nature should be observed and its ways of controlling vegetation.Lists examples where plant eating insects were used to get rid of weeds. Cheaper and environment friendly.Chapter 7: Needless HavocThe effect on animals. Witnesses should be those with proper training in the field i.e. biologist and without connections with companies (conflic of interest).Entomologists not trained and psychologically are not inclined to see the destruction.The Japanese Beetla and use of chemicals to kill it. Blanket use of Alldrin by airplanes. Results several days later with hell a lot of dead birds. Many other animals sick or dead. Many people sick.Similar other programs, most notably in Sheldon. Many wild animals and livestock died.East cost strategies were different from mid West, they used the natural enemies of the Japaneses beetles and this worked. This should have been replicated in mid West.It is morally wrong to kill thousands of wild animals, who die in agony for no reason.Chapter 8: And No Bird SingElm trees got a fungal disease from Europe called Dutch Elm disease. It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons. DDT for bud worm. Rain taking the pesticides down to the rivers. Factories emptying their pesticides intos rivers and gulfs. Details, similar in fashion to previous chapters.Research needs more fundingChapter 10: Indiscriminately from the skiesToday's poisons are much more dangerous yet instead of careful application to the target only like before we are sparying them indiscriminately from sky. Over fields and towns.The Jipsi moth. Blank spraying (of everything) instead of using natural killers. Court cases.The fire ant. Use of misleading propaganda.Milk with DDT sold in the market. Big mistakes made by a government agency. Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers. The government (FDA) protection for the public is very limited.Tolerance tests dor drugs do not take account the accumulative effect of ingesting so many source of DDT contaminated food. The tolerance for many types of pesticides in food should be brought downInspection is weak and non-existent in trade within the same state; this should be brought up.Chapter 12: The human price""Man, however much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature.""Poisons accumulate in adipose tissue and are drawn upon when fat is used such as when losing weight (diet regime or sickness).Effects on liver. General bad effects on humans. Patient cases and research findings.Chapter 13: Through a narrow windowWill go to a cellular level.Damages respiration cycle of the cell in mitochondria [Kerb cycle?]. ATP is the result. ATP & ADP.Bad effects of pesticide induced hypoxia (lack of ATP) on embryos at early stages of development (starting from sperms and eggs). Oligospermua.Pesticides (some) having a similar effect to radiation, they damage chromosomes and cause mutations. Needs further studying.Chapter 14: 1 in every 4Pesticide carcinogenic effect. Stories, research etc.Importance of prevention. Environmental prevention measures are better than any possible cures. We shoud eliminate carcinogens in food, water supply and air or reduce their impactChapter 15: Nature fights backInsects evolve resistance and fight back pesticides.Our chemicals destroy the natural defences against insects which are the most important in keeping insect numbers in check.Lists examples of these natural defenses and how the use of chemicals backfired due to their destruction.Examples of biological control, and how use of pesticides destroys their effective work done very cheaply.Speaks against ""economical"" entomologists.Chapter 16: The rumblings of an avalanche""If Darwin were alive today, the insect world would delight and astound him with its impressive verification of his theories of the survival of the fittest.""Evolution of resistance. Not many people understand this, and therefore they follow stupid strategies.This is a very serious issue, as serious as the atomic bomb!History of evolution of resistance to various types of pesticides. It evolves very fast, in months sometimes. Average 2-3 years. The other extreme is 6 years.Warns against the future if this is continued.Resistance developes not in an individual, but in oipulations over generations.Instructions to reduce evolution of resistance. At some places it went out of control. More and more people are realizing that biological control is needed and that chemical control is futile, short minded and lacks scientific insightChapter 17: The other roadBiological solutions may appear harder and slower at first, but on the long run they are the safest most reliable, last for much longer and are also cheaper.Sterilization with radiation if screwworm was very successful, exterminating them completely from the area.Research ongoing to find sterilization methods which are specific.Confusing the male gypsi moths and deceiving them by using female scent for sexual attraction. Sound (including ultrasound) can play an attractive/repellent role too.U/s as a weapon.Control of insects with microorganisms. Very specific.Conclusion""The ""control of nature"" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

My family members should watch their drinks, apparently.]Trailblazing female marine biologist in the 1940s & 50s? Check.Thinks humans are arrogant and overstate their significance in the world? Check. Changed the world with a book? Check.Wrote a readable book for laypeople, not academics? Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
70,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
71,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
72,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
73,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

75,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"

However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

81,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
82,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
83,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
84,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
85,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
86,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
87,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.
88,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book in its position as the historical spark for the contemporary environmental movement. At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban. This book is a wonderful balance of science (dated a bit now, but still good stuff) and engaging writing.If you can't tell, I'm a pretty big Rachel Carson fan.

93,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."

Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "

She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests.

From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying.

It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons.

Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers.

Not many people understand this, and therefore they follow stupid strategies.This is a very serious issue, as serious as the atomic bomb!History of evolution of resistance to various types of pesticides. It evolves very fast, in months sometimes. Average 2-3 years. The other extreme is 6 years.Warns against the future if this is continued.Resistance developes not in an individual, but in oipulations over generations.Instructions to reduce evolution of resistance. At some places it went out of control.

Sound (including ultrasound) can play an attractive/repellent role too.U/s as a weapon.Control of insects with microorganisms. Very specific.Conclusion""The ""control of nature"" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

My family members should watch their drinks, apparently.]Trailblazing female marine biologist in the 1940s & 50s? Check.Thinks humans are arrogant and overstate their significance in the world? Check. Changed the world with a book? Check.Wrote a readable book for laypeople, not academics? Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
100,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
101,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
102,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
103,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

105,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"

However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

110,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54083442-horace-derwent,5,"one of the most important books in history and it did change the history, nothing else to say"
111,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
112,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
113,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!

The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
115,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
116,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
117,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.
118,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book in its position as the historical spark for the contemporary environmental movement. At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "

We are possibly not plagued by pesticides today but the contemporary world continuously abounds with other man-inflicted predicaments.The book transcends its time and contents and assumes new revelations and significance for the modern society.

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban. This book is a wonderful balance of science (dated a bit now, but still good stuff) and engaging writing.If you can't tell, I'm a pretty big Rachel Carson fan. She is a genuine, engaging scientist with a passion for nature that rivals even that of John Muir."

123,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."
125,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11714857-bob-sundahl,1,"My reading at the time was an enlightenment into the damage that the use of chemicals had been doing to our environment. Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "
126,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,I am very glad that I finally read this classic. It is clear why this became such a game-changer in environmental awareness. Silent Spring is carefully researched and very convincing. It was a bit long-winded at times and I will admit that my attention sometimes wandered while listening to the audiobook. 
127,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,3,"My notes while reading the book:Originated the modern environmental movement.Short summary of her and her book. She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil. Other plants which we may classify as weed (and ruthlessly eradicate) could be doing the same positive job.Blanket spraying can paradoxically leads to more weed as it clears the field for them.Nature should be observed and its ways of controlling vegetation.Lists examples where plant eating insects were used to get rid of weeds. Cheaper and environment friendly.Chapter 7: Needless HavocThe effect on animals. Witnesses should be those with proper training in the field i.e. biologist and without connections with companies (conflic of interest).Entomologists not trained and psychologically are not inclined to see the destruction.The Japanese Beetla and use of chemicals to kill it. Blanket use of Alldrin by airplanes. Results several days later with hell a lot of dead birds. Many other animals sick or dead. Many people sick.Similar other programs, most notably in Sheldon. Many wild animals and livestock died.East cost strategies were different from mid West, they used the natural enemies of the Japaneses beetles and this worked. This should have been replicated in mid West.It is morally wrong to kill thousands of wild animals, who die in agony for no reason.Chapter 8: And No Bird SingElm trees got a fungal disease from Europe called Dutch Elm disease. It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons. DDT for bud worm. Rain taking the pesticides down to the rivers. Factories emptying their pesticides intos rivers and gulfs. Details, similar in fashion to previous chapters.Research needs more fundingChapter 10: Indiscriminately from the skiesToday's poisons are much more dangerous yet instead of careful application to the target only like before we are sparying them indiscriminately from sky. Over fields and towns.The Jipsi moth. Blank spraying (of everything) instead of using natural killers. Court cases.The fire ant. Use of misleading propaganda.Milk with DDT sold in the market. Big mistakes made by a government agency. Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers. The government (FDA) protection for the public is very limited.Tolerance tests dor drugs do not take account the accumulative effect of ingesting so many source of DDT contaminated food. The tolerance for many types of pesticides in food should be brought downInspection is weak and non-existent in trade within the same state; this should be brought up.Chapter 12: The human price""Man, however much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature.""Poisons accumulate in adipose tissue and are drawn upon when fat is used such as when losing weight (diet regime or sickness).Effects on liver.

The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
130,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
131,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
132,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
133,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

135,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"

However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

140,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54083442-horace-derwent,5,"one of the most important books in history and it did change the history, nothing else to say"
141,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
142,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
143,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
144,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
145,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
146,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
147,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.

At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "

We are possibly not plagued by pesticides today but the contemporary world continuously abounds with other man-inflicted predicaments.The book transcends its time and contents and assumes new revelations and significance for the modern society. Unfortunately,The slow undoing and apocalypse triggerd by human beings have evolved with the time . We all know we need to be pragmatic and cannot possess too high expectations for our inertia . Virus could evolve into variables more fatal , likewise , so many invisible and imperceptible new camouflaged undoings canstill beset andtraumatize us. In order to read the book and to be familiar with the background knowledge（the background information is not intricate actually）, I took some classes and lectures on Biology and pharmacology. And it turns out that I become a bit obsessed with biological science, biochemistry and pharmacy. Ispent asmuch time as I could spare getting emersed in those classes and made foray into the new and dived into these stuff with colossal vitality . If I become more interdisciplinary, the book is that lighthouse.Inadvertent occurence could evolve into an serendipity! The future Self should not be surprised if I were to like other subjects .

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban. This book is a wonderful balance of science (dated a bit now, but still good stuff) and engaging writing.If you can't tell, I'm a pretty big Rachel Carson fan. She is a genuine, engaging scientist with a passion for nature that rivals even that of John Muir."

153,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."
155,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11714857-bob-sundahl,1,"My reading at the time was an enlightenment into the damage that the use of chemicals had been doing to our environment. Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "
156,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,I am very glad that I finally read this classic. It is clear why this became such a game-changer in environmental awareness. Silent Spring is carefully researched and very convincing. It was a bit long-winded at times and I will admit that my attention sometimes wandered while listening to the audiobook. 
157,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,3,"My notes while reading the book:Originated the modern environmental movement.Short summary of her and her book. She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil. Other plants which we may classify as weed (and ruthlessly eradicate) could be doing the same positive job.Blanket spraying can paradoxically leads to more weed as it clears the field for them.Nature should be observed and its ways of controlling vegetation.Lists examples where plant eating insects were used to get rid of weeds. Cheaper and environment friendly.Chapter 7: Needless HavocThe effect on animals. Witnesses should be those with proper training in the field i.e. biologist and without connections with companies (conflic of interest).Entomologists not trained and psychologically are not inclined to see the destruction.The Japanese Beetla and use of chemicals to kill it. Blanket use of Alldrin by airplanes. Results several days later with hell a lot of dead birds. Many other animals sick or dead. Many people sick.Similar other programs, most notably in Sheldon. Many wild animals and livestock died.East cost strategies were different from mid West, they used the natural enemies of the Japaneses beetles and this worked. This should have been replicated in mid West.It is morally wrong to kill thousands of wild animals, who die in agony for no reason.Chapter 8: And No Bird SingElm trees got a fungal disease from Europe called Dutch Elm disease. It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons. DDT for bud worm. Rain taking the pesticides down to the rivers. Factories emptying their pesticides intos rivers and gulfs. Details, similar in fashion to previous chapters.Research needs more fundingChapter 10: Indiscriminately from the skiesToday's poisons are much more dangerous yet instead of careful application to the target only like before we are sparying them indiscriminately from sky. Over fields and towns.The Jipsi moth. Blank spraying (of everything) instead of using natural killers. Court cases.The fire ant. Use of misleading propaganda.Milk with DDT sold in the market. Big mistakes made by a government agency. Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers. The government (FDA) protection for the public is very limited.Tolerance tests dor drugs do not take account the accumulative effect of ingesting so many source of DDT contaminated food. The tolerance for many types of pesticides in food should be brought downInspection is weak and non-existent in trade within the same state; this should be brought up.Chapter 12: The human price""Man, however much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature.""Poisons accumulate in adipose tissue and are drawn upon when fat is used such as when losing weight (diet regime or sickness).Effects on liver. General bad effects on humans. Patient cases and research findings.Chapter 13: Through a narrow windowWill go to a cellular level.Damages respiration cycle of the cell in mitochondria [Kerb cycle?]. ATP is the result. ATP & ADP.Bad effects of pesticide induced hypoxia (lack of ATP) on embryos at early stages of development (starting from sperms and eggs). Oligospermua.Pesticides (some) having a similar effect to radiation, they damage chromosomes and cause mutations. Needs further studying.Chapter 14: 1 in every 4Pesticide carcinogenic effect. Stories, research etc.Importance of prevention. Environmental prevention measures are better than any possible cures. We shoud eliminate carcinogens in food, water supply and air or reduce their impactChapter 15: Nature fights backInsects evolve resistance and fight back pesticides.Our chemicals destroy the natural defences against insects which are the most important in keeping insect numbers in check.Lists examples of these natural defenses and how the use of chemicals backfired due to their destruction.Examples of biological control, and how use of pesticides destroys their effective work done very cheaply.Speaks against ""economical"" entomologists.Chapter 16: The rumblings of an avalanche""If Darwin were alive today, the insect world would delight and astound him with its impressive verification of his theories of the survival of the fittest.""Evolution of resistance. Not many people understand this, and therefore they follow stupid strategies.This is a very serious issue, as serious as the atomic bomb!History of evolution of resistance to various types of pesticides. It evolves very fast, in months sometimes. Average 2-3 years. The other extreme is 6 years.Warns against the future if this is continued.Resistance developes not in an individual, but in oipulations over generations.Instructions to reduce evolution of resistance. At some places it went out of control. More and more people are realizing that biological control is needed and that chemical control is futile, short minded and lacks scientific insightChapter 17: The other roadBiological solutions may appear harder and slower at first, but on the long run they are the safest most reliable, last for much longer and are also cheaper.Sterilization with radiation if screwworm was very successful, exterminating them completely from the area.Research ongoing to find sterilization methods which are specific.Confusing the male gypsi moths and deceiving them by using female scent for sexual attraction. Sound (including ultrasound) can play an attractive/repellent role too.U/s as a weapon.Control of insects with microorganisms. Very specific.Conclusion""The ""control of nature"" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here.

Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
160,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
161,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
162,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
163,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."
164,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,0,"This may have been a ""brilliantly written book"" when it came out in the early 60s, but time has not been kind to Ms Carson.At times, her dry, overly-scientific approach to her subject makes the head hurt.That said, however, Silent Spring does deserve it's 'classic' tag, and it is as relevant today as it ever was.From detailing man's arrogant bid to rid the world of 'pests' using the new toys found in the chemistry lab, Carson shows just how much damage can be done if we don't pay attention to the world around us - how big man's folly can be if he decides he knows better than nature.The fact Government agencies allowed the wholesale dusting of incesticides and pesticides is bewildering, and leaves the reader both angry and sharing the sense of betrayal felt by those most damaged by the belief that DDT (among many others) could cure all ills.It may not be the lightest of reads, but it is worth the effort as there is light at the end of Silent Spring's dark tunnel."
165,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"
166,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11351200-leslie,5,"As expected, the science is a bit dated since this book is now ~50 years old. However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

This book is a real cautionary tale that we all should read and heed before what Miss Carson uncovered in the '60s becomes irreversible, assuming it isn't already too late."

Then came terrorism... and Nature keeps on dying all around us.This was clarion call and many responded to it, but the opposition responded as well. We need to gather our forces..."

It’s an important read that made more of an impact on history than most books I’ve read, period. It still makes a good impact, despite the rotating light show that modern American life threatens to inch itself into becoming — if it isn’t one already. But every inch counts, and this book has miles on it. "
170,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54083442-horace-derwent,5,"one of the most important books in history and it did change the history, nothing else to say"
171,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
172,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
173,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
174,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
175,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
176,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
177,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.
178,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book in its position as the historical spark for the contemporary environmental movement. At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "
179,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35434974-kevin,4,"The democratization of environmentalism, away from conservation for the elites and towards a global right for humans and ecosystems, is difficult to overstate.

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban. This book is a wonderful balance of science (dated a bit now, but still good stuff) and engaging writing.If you can't tell, I'm a pretty big Rachel Carson fan.

183,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."

Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "
186,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,I am very glad that I finally read this classic. It is clear why this became such a game-changer in environmental awareness. Silent Spring is carefully researched and very convincing. It was a bit long-winded at times and I will admit that my attention sometimes wandered while listening to the audiobook.

She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil. Other plants which we may classify as weed (and ruthlessly eradicate) could be doing the same positive job.Blanket spraying can paradoxically leads to more weed as it clears the field for them.Nature should be observed and its ways of controlling vegetation.Lists examples where plant eating insects were used to get rid of weeds. Cheaper and environment friendly.Chapter 7: Needless HavocThe effect on animals. Witnesses should be those with proper training in the field i.e. biologist and without connections with companies (conflic of interest).Entomologists not trained and psychologically are not inclined to see the destruction.The Japanese Beetla and use of chemicals to kill it. Blanket use of Alldrin by airplanes. Results several days later with hell a lot of dead birds. Many other animals sick or dead. Many people sick.Similar other programs, most notably in Sheldon. Many wild animals and livestock died.East cost strategies were different from mid West, they used the natural enemies of the Japaneses beetles and this worked. This should have been replicated in mid West.It is morally wrong to kill thousands of wild animals, who die in agony for no reason.Chapter 8: And No Bird SingElm trees got a fungal disease from Europe called Dutch Elm disease. It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons. DDT for bud worm. Rain taking the pesticides down to the rivers. Factories emptying their pesticides intos rivers and gulfs. Details, similar in fashion to previous chapters.Research needs more fundingChapter 10: Indiscriminately from the skiesToday's poisons are much more dangerous yet instead of careful application to the target only like before we are sparying them indiscriminately from sky. Over fields and towns.The Jipsi moth. Blank spraying (of everything) instead of using natural killers. Court cases.The fire ant. Use of misleading propaganda.Milk with DDT sold in the market. Big mistakes made by a government agency. Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers. The government (FDA) protection for the public is very limited.Tolerance tests dor drugs do not take account the accumulative effect of ingesting so many source of DDT contaminated food. The tolerance for many types of pesticides in food should be brought downInspection is weak and non-existent in trade within the same state; this should be brought up.Chapter 12: The human price""Man, however much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature.""Poisons accumulate in adipose tissue and are drawn upon when fat is used such as when losing weight (diet regime or sickness).Effects on liver. General bad effects on humans. Patient cases and research findings.Chapter 13: Through a narrow windowWill go to a cellular level.Damages respiration cycle of the cell in mitochondria [Kerb cycle?]. ATP is the result. ATP & ADP.Bad effects of pesticide induced hypoxia (lack of ATP) on embryos at early stages of development (starting from sperms and eggs). Oligospermua.Pesticides (some) having a similar effect to radiation, they damage chromosomes and cause mutations. Needs further studying.Chapter 14: 1 in every 4Pesticide carcinogenic effect. Stories, research etc.Importance of prevention. Environmental prevention measures are better than any possible cures. We shoud eliminate carcinogens in food, water supply and air or reduce their impactChapter 15: Nature fights backInsects evolve resistance and fight back pesticides.Our chemicals destroy the natural defences against insects which are the most important in keeping insect numbers in check.Lists examples of these natural defenses and how the use of chemicals backfired due to their destruction.Examples of biological control, and how use of pesticides destroys their effective work done very cheaply.Speaks against ""economical"" entomologists.Chapter 16: The rumblings of an avalanche""If Darwin were alive today, the insect world would delight and astound him with its impressive verification of his theories of the survival of the fittest.""Evolution of resistance. Not many people understand this, and therefore they follow stupid strategies.This is a very serious issue, as serious as the atomic bomb!History of evolution of resistance to various types of pesticides. It evolves very fast, in months sometimes. Average 2-3 years. The other extreme is 6 years.Warns against the future if this is continued.Resistance developes not in an individual, but in oipulations over generations.Instructions to reduce evolution of resistance. At some places it went out of control. More and more people are realizing that biological control is needed and that chemical control is futile, short minded and lacks scientific insightChapter 17: The other roadBiological solutions may appear harder and slower at first, but on the long run they are the safest most reliable, last for much longer and are also cheaper.Sterilization with radiation if screwworm was very successful, exterminating them completely from the area.Research ongoing to find sterilization methods which are specific.Confusing the male gypsi moths and deceiving them by using female scent for sexual attraction. Sound (including ultrasound) can play an attractive/repellent role too.U/s as a weapon.Control of insects with microorganisms. Very specific.Conclusion""The ""control of nature"" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

Check. Changed the world with a book? Check.Wrote a readable book for laypeople, not academics? Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
190,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
191,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
192,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
193,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

195,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"
196,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11351200-leslie,5,"As expected, the science is a bit dated since this book is now ~50 years old. However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."
197,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12765668-linda,5,"After reading this amazing, mind-blowing exposé of the near disastrous consequences that humans have wrought on the natural world with our overuse and misuse of pesticides, I'll never take birds, fish and even the lowly earthworms for granted again. This book is a real cautionary tale that we all should read and heed before what Miss Carson uncovered in the '60s becomes irreversible, assuming it isn't already too late."
198,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,5,"An incredible book! And sad... I remember when I was in grade school making up a poem about pollution. This was in the 70s when we actually cared a little. Then came the 80s when it was all about greed. Then the 90s and we were worried about other things. Then came terrorism... and Nature keeps on dying all around us.This was clarion call and many responded to it, but the opposition responded as well. We need to gather our forces..."

It’s an important read that made more of an impact on history than most books I’ve read, period. It still makes a good impact, despite the rotating light show that modern American life threatens to inch itself into becoming — if it isn’t one already. But every inch counts, and this book has miles on it. "
200,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54083442-horace-derwent,5,"one of the most important books in history and it did change the history, nothing else to say"
201,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
202,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
203,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
204,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
205,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
206,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
207,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.
208,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book in its position as the historical spark for the contemporary environmental movement. At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "
209,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35434974-kevin,4,"The democratization of environmentalism, away from conservation for the elites and towards a global right for humans and ecosystems, is difficult to overstate. The struggle has always existed, but the costs of failures have certainly escalated beyond imagination since WWII:--The updated (2016) go-to book on the environmental crisis, synthesizing Earth Systems science with political economy: Facing the Anthropocene: Fossil Capitalism and the Crisis of the Earth System--Chomsky on the 21st century and beyond:  Nuclear War and Environmental Catastrophe).

We are possibly not plagued by pesticides today but the contemporary world continuously abounds with other man-inflicted predicaments.The book transcends its time and contents and assumes new revelations and significance for the modern society.

And it turns out that I become a bit obsessed with biological science, biochemistry and pharmacy. Ispent asmuch time as I could spare getting emersed in those classes and made foray into the new and dived into these stuff with colossal vitality .

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban. This book is a wonderful balance of science (dated a bit now, but still good stuff) and engaging writing.If you can't tell, I'm a pretty big Rachel Carson fan.

213,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."

Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "
216,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,I am very glad that I finally read this classic. It is clear why this became such a game-changer in environmental awareness. Silent Spring is carefully researched and very convincing. It was a bit long-winded at times and I will admit that my attention sometimes wandered while listening to the audiobook. 
217,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,3,"My notes while reading the book:Originated the modern environmental movement.Short summary of her and her book. She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil. Other plants which we may classify as weed (and ruthlessly eradicate) could be doing the same positive job.Blanket spraying can paradoxically leads to more weed as it clears the field for them.Nature should be observed and its ways of controlling vegetation.Lists examples where plant eating insects were used to get rid of weeds. Cheaper and environment friendly.Chapter 7: Needless HavocThe effect on animals. Witnesses should be those with proper training in the field i.e. biologist and without connections with companies (conflic of interest).Entomologists not trained and psychologically are not inclined to see the destruction.The Japanese Beetla and use of chemicals to kill it. Blanket use of Alldrin by airplanes. Results several days later with hell a lot of dead birds. Many other animals sick or dead. Many people sick.Similar other programs, most notably in Sheldon. Many wild animals and livestock died.East cost strategies were different from mid West, they used the natural enemies of the Japaneses beetles and this worked. This should have been replicated in mid West.It is morally wrong to kill thousands of wild animals, who die in agony for no reason.Chapter 8: And No Bird SingElm trees got a fungal disease from Europe called Dutch Elm disease. It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons. DDT for bud worm. Rain taking the pesticides down to the rivers. Factories emptying their pesticides intos rivers and gulfs. Details, similar in fashion to previous chapters.Research needs more fundingChapter 10: Indiscriminately from the skiesToday's poisons are much more dangerous yet instead of careful application to the target only like before we are sparying them indiscriminately from sky. Over fields and towns.The Jipsi moth. Blank spraying (of everything) instead of using natural killers. Court cases.The fire ant. Use of misleading propaganda.Milk with DDT sold in the market. Big mistakes made by a government agency. Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers. The government (FDA) protection for the public is very limited.Tolerance tests dor drugs do not take account the accumulative effect of ingesting so many source of DDT contaminated food. The tolerance for many types of pesticides in food should be brought downInspection is weak and non-existent in trade within the same state; this should be brought up.Chapter 12: The human price""Man, however much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature.""Poisons accumulate in adipose tissue and are drawn upon when fat is used such as when losing weight (diet regime or sickness).Effects on liver. General bad effects on humans. Patient cases and research findings.Chapter 13: Through a narrow windowWill go to a cellular level.Damages respiration cycle of the cell in mitochondria [Kerb cycle?]. ATP is the result. ATP & ADP.Bad effects of pesticide induced hypoxia (lack of ATP) on embryos at early stages of development (starting from sperms and eggs). Oligospermua.Pesticides (some) having a similar effect to radiation, they damage chromosomes and cause mutations. Needs further studying.Chapter 14: 1 in every 4Pesticide carcinogenic effect. Stories, research etc.Importance of prevention. Environmental prevention measures are better than any possible cures. We shoud eliminate carcinogens in food, water supply and air or reduce their impactChapter 15: Nature fights backInsects evolve resistance and fight back pesticides.Our chemicals destroy the natural defences against insects which are the most important in keeping insect numbers in check.Lists examples of these natural defenses and how the use of chemicals backfired due to their destruction.Examples of biological control, and how use of pesticides destroys their effective work done very cheaply.Speaks against ""economical"" entomologists.Chapter 16: The rumblings of an avalanche""If Darwin were alive today, the insect world would delight and astound him with its impressive verification of his theories of the survival of the fittest.""Evolution of resistance. Not many people understand this, and therefore they follow stupid strategies.This is a very serious issue, as serious as the atomic bomb!History of evolution of resistance to various types of pesticides. It evolves very fast, in months sometimes. Average 2-3 years. The other extreme is 6 years.Warns against the future if this is continued.Resistance developes not in an individual, but in oipulations over generations.Instructions to reduce evolution of resistance. At some places it went out of control. More and more people are realizing that biological control is needed and that chemical control is futile, short minded and lacks scientific insightChapter 17: The other roadBiological solutions may appear harder and slower at first, but on the long run they are the safest most reliable, last for much longer and are also cheaper.Sterilization with radiation if screwworm was very successful, exterminating them completely from the area.Research ongoing to find sterilization methods which are specific.Confusing the male gypsi moths and deceiving them by using female scent for sexual attraction. Sound (including ultrasound) can play an attractive/repellent role too.U/s as a weapon.Control of insects with microorganisms. Very specific.Conclusion""The ""control of nature"" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

My family members should watch their drinks, apparently.]Trailblazing female marine biologist in the 1940s & 50s? Check.Thinks humans are arrogant and overstate their significance in the world? Check. Changed the world with a book? Check.Wrote a readable book for laypeople, not academics? Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
220,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
221,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
222,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
223,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

225,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"
226,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11351200-leslie,5,"As expected, the science is a bit dated since this book is now ~50 years old. However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

Then came terrorism... and Nature keeps on dying all around us.This was clarion call and many responded to it, but the opposition responded as well. We need to gather our forces..."

231,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
232,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
233,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
234,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
235,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
236,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
237,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.
238,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book in its position as the historical spark for the contemporary environmental movement. At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban.

243,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."

Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "

How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil. Other plants which we may classify as weed (and ruthlessly eradicate) could be doing the same positive job.Blanket spraying can paradoxically leads to more weed as it clears the field for them.Nature should be observed and its ways of controlling vegetation.Lists examples where plant eating insects were used to get rid of weeds. Cheaper and environment friendly.Chapter 7: Needless HavocThe effect on animals. Witnesses should be those with proper training in the field i.e. biologist and without connections with companies (conflic of interest).Entomologists not trained and psychologically are not inclined to see the destruction.The Japanese Beetla and use of chemicals to kill it. Blanket use of Alldrin by airplanes. Results several days later with hell a lot of dead birds. Many other animals sick or dead. Many people sick.Similar other programs, most notably in Sheldon. Many wild animals and livestock died.East cost strategies were different from mid West, they used the natural enemies of the Japaneses beetles and this worked. This should have been replicated in mid West.It is morally wrong to kill thousands of wild animals, who die in agony for no reason.Chapter 8: And No Bird SingElm trees got a fungal disease from Europe called Dutch Elm disease. It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy. Variety should be conserved.The declining number of eagles due to reduction of their reproduction capacity because of DDT.Seeds coated with DDT, parathion or Alldrin > seed eaters, fish and birds > carnivoresQuestions the authority given to people who take these decisions which are against the interests of the public and environment.Chapter 9: Rivers of deathSalmons. DDT for bud worm. Rain taking the pesticides down to the rivers. Factories emptying their pesticides intos rivers and gulfs. Details, similar in fashion to previous chapters.Research needs more fundingChapter 10: Indiscriminately from the skiesToday's poisons are much more dangerous yet instead of careful application to the target only like before we are sparying them indiscriminately from sky. Over fields and towns.The Jipsi moth. Blank spraying (of everything) instead of using natural killers. Court cases.The fire ant. Use of misleading propaganda.Milk with DDT sold in the market. Big mistakes made by a government agency. Didn't know the minimal required amount of DDT to be used or its bad environmental effects despite plenty of research available, yet still carried on with their program for some years!It failed of course (+ all the environmental damage + cost). This became obvious and they had to back down.Chapter 11: Beyond the dreams of the BorguesPoisons (death dealing material) sold in the market easily without any checks.The public encouraged to use pesticides in daily activities and gardening (without proper warnings or safety measures). Can get public waters contaminated and put the people using them at risk.The average American in 1956-7 had between 5-7 PPM of DDT in his body. This mainly from food, all of which was contaminated by DDT. Washing and cooking doesn't remove these poisons! Dairy products!Misuse and overuse by farmers. The government (FDA) protection for the public is very limited.Tolerance tests dor drugs do not take account the accumulative effect of ingesting so many source of DDT contaminated food. The tolerance for many types of pesticides in food should be brought downInspection is weak and non-existent in trade within the same state; this should be brought up.Chapter 12: The human price""Man, however much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature.""Poisons accumulate in adipose tissue and are drawn upon when fat is used such as when losing weight (diet regime or sickness).Effects on liver. General bad effects on humans. Patient cases and research findings.Chapter 13: Through a narrow windowWill go to a cellular level.Damages respiration cycle of the cell in mitochondria [Kerb cycle?]. ATP is the result. ATP & ADP.Bad effects of pesticide induced hypoxia (lack of ATP) on embryos at early stages of development (starting from sperms and eggs). Oligospermua.Pesticides (some) having a similar effect to radiation, they damage chromosomes and cause mutations. Needs further studying.Chapter 14: 1 in every 4Pesticide carcinogenic effect. Stories, research etc.Importance of prevention. Environmental prevention measures are better than any possible cures. We shoud eliminate carcinogens in food, water supply and air or reduce their impactChapter 15: Nature fights backInsects evolve resistance and fight back pesticides.Our chemicals destroy the natural defences against insects which are the most important in keeping insect numbers in check.Lists examples of these natural defenses and how the use of chemicals backfired due to their destruction.Examples of biological control, and how use of pesticides destroys their effective work done very cheaply.Speaks against ""economical"" entomologists.Chapter 16: The rumblings of an avalanche""If Darwin were alive today, the insect world would delight and astound him with its impressive verification of his theories of the survival of the fittest.""Evolution of resistance. Not many people understand this, and therefore they follow stupid strategies.This is a very serious issue, as serious as the atomic bomb!History of evolution of resistance to various types of pesticides. It evolves very fast, in months sometimes. Average 2-3 years. The other extreme is 6 years.Warns against the future if this is continued.Resistance developes not in an individual, but in oipulations over generations.Instructions to reduce evolution of resistance. At some places it went out of control. More and more people are realizing that biological control is needed and that chemical control is futile, short minded and lacks scientific insightChapter 17: The other roadBiological solutions may appear harder and slower at first, but on the long run they are the safest most reliable, last for much longer and are also cheaper.Sterilization with radiation if screwworm was very successful, exterminating them completely from the area.Research ongoing to find sterilization methods which are specific.Confusing the male gypsi moths and deceiving them by using female scent for sexual attraction. Sound (including ultrasound) can play an attractive/repellent role too.U/s as a weapon.Control of insects with microorganisms. Very specific.Conclusion""The ""control of nature"" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

My family members should watch their drinks, apparently.]Trailblazing female marine biologist in the 1940s & 50s? Check.Thinks humans are arrogant and overstate their significance in the world? Check. Changed the world with a book? Check.Wrote a readable book for laypeople, not academics? Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
250,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
251,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
252,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
253,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

255,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"

However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

261,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
262,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
263,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
264,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
265,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."
266,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050340-katie,5,"In a bunch of my bio classes, they inevitably referenced this book, and how it ""changed the course of history"" and the way people thought about pesticides, raising a public outcry that forced the ban of DDT and eventually changed legislation regarding air, land, and water quality. I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."
267,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher,4,This book was so terrifying. It was well written. I could really tell that Carson was passionate about this topic and that she researched the things she included in her book a lot.
268,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book in its position as the historical spark for the contemporary environmental movement. At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "
269,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35434974-kevin,4,"The democratization of environmentalism, away from conservation for the elites and towards a global right for humans and ecosystems, is difficult to overstate.

I'm currently reading ""The Sea Around Us,"" but am rating this one from a couple of years' memory.This book is truly a classic in the nature lit world. Carson has that unique ability, like Stephen Jay Gould and Carl Sagan, to write like a creative writer while coming to us from the world of science. So if you read this, don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly in a section of prose to equal the very best of nature writers. If you don't already know, Rachel Carson was instrumental in spreading the word on the dangers of DDT and is credited with spearheading it's ban. This book is a wonderful balance of science (dated a bit now, but still good stuff) and engaging writing.If you can't tell, I'm a pretty big Rachel Carson fan.

273,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,5,"The “silent spring” that Rachel Carson foresaw in her 1962 classic of environmentalist literature is upon us today, on this Earth Day 2020. It may not be exactly the kind of “silent spring” that Carson predicted, but it is one that should get all people everywhere thinking very carefully about the way we treat our world. As prescient now as it was 58 years ago, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring is one of the most important works of environmental literature ever written.Carson’s life provides an inspiring example of a woman forging success in a male-dominated field – in this case, science writing – through talent and hard work. Originally from the Western Pennsylvania farm community of Springdale, Carson attended the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) and continued her studies of zoology at Johns Hopkins, where she earned a master’s degree. Writing for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson quickly demonstrated literary talent that attracted the attention of prestigious publishers like the Atlantic Monthly magazine and the Simon & Schuster publishing house.Early Carson works like The Sea Around Us (1951) and The Edge of the Sea (1955) did a brilliant job of making scientific subject matter accessible to, and interesting for, a lay audience, and by the early 1960’s Carson had in mind a work that would combine exposition with advocacy. She saw the harm that powerful pesticides were inflicting on the natural environment, while the big chemical manufacturers provided bland assurances that their products were safe. Consequently, Carson made the courageous decision to take on the chemical industry and denounce its deadly products.Carson begins Silent Spring with an unforgettable, profoundly disturbing first chapter that is titled “A Fable for Tomorrow.” In that chapter, she asks the reader to imagine “a town in the heart of America” – a town, perhaps, much like Carson’s hometown of Springdale, Pennsylvania – where “a strange blight crept over the area”, sickening livestock, rendering fruit trees infertile, driving away songbirds, killing the fish of local waterways, and finally bringing sickness and death to the people of the town themselves. “No witchcraft, no enemy action, had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world,” Carson writes grimly. “The people had done it themselves” (pp. 1-2).Having asked the rhetorical question “What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in America?”, Carson answers by writing that “The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and lethal materials” (pp. 4-5) – chiefly, as she clarifies, the chemicals manufactured to destroy animals and plants that are deemed to be “pests.”Carson, for all of the often poetic quality of her prose, is a tough-minded scientist, and she is merciless in demolishing the arguments that the big chemical companies had developed to defend the sale and use of powerful pesticides like dichlorophenyltrichloroethane – a chemical that you may know better by its standard abbreviation of DDT – in passages like this one:The old legend that “a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless” means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times, DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years, the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds. (p. 57)In connection with phenomena like anti-insect sprayings that kill birds, or anti-weed sprayings that kill farm produce and wildflowers, Carson sets forth a core theme of the book: “The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized” (p. 98).Carson also gets the reader thinking about the way in which the American public’s thinking about poisons has itself changed:Our attitude toward poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything – human or non-human – within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. (pp. 155-56)Part of what gives Silent Spring its power is the sheer joy with which Carson writes about science. She makes the magic and the symmetry and the beauty of science come alive, even for the non-science-savvy reader. I liked, for instance, the appealing, audience-friendly manner in which Carson explained oxidation as “The transformation of matter into energy in the cell…an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning” (p. 200).Having thus advanced the reader’s understanding of how “This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living world” (p. 200), Carson then makes the reader care about how modern pesticides can wreck the machinery of that cellular-level “chemical factory”:DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells of usable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences… (p. 204)When she wrote Silent Spring, Carson had to know that the chemical industry would attack her without mercy. Linda Lear’s foreword to this edition of Carson’s classic text makes clear just how bitter and personal the industry’s attacks upon the book and its author were:In 1962…the multimillion-dollar industrial chemical industry was not about to allow…a female scientist without a Ph.D. or an institutional affiliation…to undermine public confidence in its products or to question its integrity. It was clear to the industry that Rachel Carson was a hysterical woman whose alarming view of the future could be ignored or, if necessary, suppressed. She was a “bird and bunny lover,” a woman who kept cats and was therefore clearly suspect. She was a romantic “spinster” who was simply overwrought about genetics. In short, Carson was a woman out of control. She had overstepped the bounds of her gender and her science.And the chemical industry’s futile efforts to discredit Carson – efforts on which they spent the then-princely sum of $250,000 – did not represent the last time that wealthy and powerful people felt threatened by this elegant little book. A 2007 U.S. Senate resolution to honor Carson – the sort of thing that usually sails through the Senate without difficulty – was blocked by an Oklahoma senator who accused Carson of using “junk science” and unfairly maligning DDT.Really, Senator? Really? I would assume that your American patriotism includes an appreciation for the bald eagle – a bird that was officially listed as an endangered species from 1973 to 1995, and stayed on the “Threatened” list until 2007. Pesticides like DDT, indiscriminately applied, weakened the shells of raptors like the bald eagle, to the point that the national symbol of the United States of America almost became extinct throughout the U.S.A. And DDT was banned across the country in 1972, and the recovery of the bald eagle population commenced almost immediately. But perhaps, for the Senator from Oklahoma, these facts would be inconvenient truths. In a chapter titled “Nature Strikes Back,” Carson evokes a concern that might have been new to her readers in her time but is only too familiar to us now – the idea that the indiscriminate use of pesticides can actually, in the long run, make pests stronger. In this model, those members of a species that survive the application of pesticide give birth to offspring that can even more successfully resist the pesticide, in a manner reminiscent of Darwin’s theory of natural selection.“With the passage of time,” Carson writes, “we may expect progressively more serious outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything we have ever known.” And to anticipate and refute the ideas of those readers who might claim that this is a problem of the future, not of the present, Carson mercilessly notes that “it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958. More examples are being found every year” (p.251).Nature Strikes Back, indeed. Did a virus jump from a bat to a pangolin to humankind – or did it jump straight from bat to humankind – or did it generate in some other way? However the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak came about, this spring of 2020 is indeed a silent spring – though not the kind that Rachel Carson warned of. It is not a silence caused by the absence of birdsong, but rather a silence brought about by the absence of human noise. As people around the world shelter in place, in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, there are fewer cars on the roads, and fewer airplanes in the now-cleaner skies. Water pollution recedes to the point that fish now swim in the suddenly-clear canals of Venice. Wildlife can be seen in the downtown streets of communities around the world: elk in England, civet cats in India, coyotes and black bears in California, monkeys in Thailand, wild goats in Wales, kangaroos in Australia, penguins in South Africa.In short, nature is sending us a signal, in much the manner that Carson suggested might happen. This beautiful planet that we have taken so much for granted could one day shrug us off, like a dog shaking off fleas, and could carry on quite well without us. Like any truly great book, like any classic of its genre, Silent Spring transcends the concerns of the time in which it was written, and speaks to each new generation of readers in fresh and new ways."

Don Martello, the instructor, had a good reputation among students which turned out to be well-deserved. I was inexperienced as a public speaker and felt it would be prudent to overcome the fear I had of it.The way the class was constructed required both research and presentation. One of my topics had to do with human destruction of the environment--a big issue for all of us kids who had been brought up with the experience of avoiding dairy products because of strontium from nuclear testing--for which Carson was a primary source.This book from so long ago came to mind because I saw a woman reading Silent Spring at the local Ennui Cafe this afternoon."
275,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11714857-bob-sundahl,1,"My reading at the time was an enlightenment into the damage that the use of chemicals had been doing to our environment. Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all. "
276,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,4,I am very glad that I finally read this classic. It is clear why this became such a game-changer in environmental awareness. Silent Spring is carefully researched and very convincing. It was a bit long-winded at times and I will admit that my attention sometimes wandered while listening to the audiobook. 
277,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,3,"My notes while reading the book:Originated the modern environmental movement.Short summary of her and her book. She was a biologist and scientific writer, faced pressure from the industry after publishing the book, but she triumphed over them. Died due to breast cancer.Read by a soft female voice. Very appropriate since author is a woman andChapter 1: A fable for tomorrowPoetic description of the possible demise and disasters striking wild life, all of them (not collectively) have actually happened somewhere. Cause ld by no other than us.Will explain why this evil is happening.Chapter 2: The obligation to endureLife can evolve, balance and adjust with time, deep time. What's happening now at our hands is so fast that life cannot keep up with what we are doing. Radioactive materials from non-natural sources.Warns against pesticides. Critical of their indifferent killing of all type of inscets and bacteria, the good and the bad, and calls them biocides (killers of life).Names DDT as the criminal, also causing evolution of more resistance strains, and even increasing the number of the bad ones by killing the good ones.These chemicals and radiation stay in our bodies and tissues, and damange them with time. They may even damage the DNA and alter it without our knowledge [epigenetic studies would've been very helpful here too].“Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind?”[Is this still happening? DDT is banned now, but are there other dangerous pesticides?]We should find methods to kill the insects and not damage our selves and the environment while doing that.Insects that are at odds with us either compete with us for food supply or carry diseases that harm us.The process that leads to increasing of the problem includes single crop farming (variety is a built in check and balance in nature), crowding, use of indiscriminate pesticides.[This reminds me of Yuval Harrari book Sapiens on how the agricultural revolution led to epidemics and famine due to humans living in crowded areas and farming single crops].Example of Elm tree and the beetle pest to show why single crop farming can be harmful.The harmful effects of introducing news species from other environment. Mentions a book called The Ecology of Invasion [uses the land bridges idea - which means this was before playe tectonics]. Many of plant enemies are imports which hitchhiked on imorted plants due to non-existent or ineffective quarantine. We need to contain and prevent this.We need more knowledge about the environment and to listen to scientists. Regulation is flawed and violations go unchecked.The public must be made aware of these problems and risks so that they can make their choice. If the founding fathers had conceived of these problems; they'd made sure that the public is not subjected to these poisons without their knowledge or consent.Speaks against industy sugar coating facts, and against unrestrained wealth making without taking account of the environment.Chapter 3: Elixers of DeathPesticides and their residues are everywhere. Rivers, animals and human bodies, mother's milk, tissue of unborn child etc.The new generation was developed during WWII and were actually made to kill humans and were tested on insects. They are so potent.Dangerous effects of Arsenic poisoning. Yet it is used as pesticide.Two groups of chemicals used as pesticides:1. The cloronated hydrocarbons such as DDT. These are the vast majority2. Organic phosphorus insecticides such as Malathion and Parathion.Carbon as a base of all living things. Its properties and the compounds it forms. CH4. CH3Cl, CHCl3, CCl4 etc.DDT invented in mid-19th century, its pesticide use discovered in 1939. The dude won a Nobel prize for that. They thought it was safe, but in fact it is harmful even in few parts per million.It is passed from one organism to another and ends up on fruits people eat, cow milk, butter, mother milk, placenta.Chlordane. More harmful than DDT. Heptochlore is also fatal. Deldrin 40-50 times more toxic than DDT - causes convulsions and death. Alldrin. Endrin, the worst of all chlorinated hydrocarbons.Organic phosphates. Produced in Germany durinf WWII alongside with Nerve Gas. They target the nervous system, acetylcholine accumulates due to destruction of cholinesterase. A little overdose is enough so regular check ups are done for workers who spray them.Parathion. Affects honey bees. Paralysis very fast. Short lived. Malathion. Interactions with other insecticides and drugs.Systemic insecticides. Made mostly from organo phosphorus insecticides. Kills any insect that comes in contact with plants. Can lead to poisonous honey. They permiate all tissues of the plant and make them toxic, can move to next generations via seeds.Similar systemic insecticides are also used on animals to kill flees.Herbicides AKA weed-killers. They affect humans too.Restrictions on Arsenic poison in UK and Australia after some sad incidents. None were in the USA at the time.Can cause thyroid malignancy.Chapter 4: Surface waters and underground seasMan forgot his origins. [yes indeed].Water (rivers and underground water) pollution by pesticides. Even after purification, the toxins from pesticides remain. It is sometimes invisible to our tests. The way we know about this is from seeing dead fish or from testing the chemicals in their bodies.Contamination of ground waters.""It is not possible to add pesticides to water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere.""Culprits 24D and DDT.24D spontaneously formed from chemicals by interactions involving water, air and sun light.Surface waters contaminated as well. 100s of brids found dead or dying due to Toxifin, DDD and DDE.Accumulates via the food chain. Those on top concentrate very high percentages of the toxins, 10s of times more than the one used on water (1000+ in million vs 50 in million).DDD causes damage to adrenal cortex leading to Addison's disease.Againt using pesticides on drinking warers for sports or other recreation activities. The unconsulted public in then forced to either drink water with poison or the tax payers money has to be used on imperfect treatment of it. Can be carcinogenic.Chapter 5: Realms of the soilFormation of the soil and its relation to life. Cycles. The components of soil. From Nitrogen fixing bacteria to EarthwormsThe effects of organics on soil isn't studied well, but it is know that they accumulate for months and years (some even decades). Poisons absorbed by plants. Their dangers.Chapter 6: Earth's Green MantleSage weed brush. Goals to remove the sage and keep the grass only. The sage a part of an ecological system which would be destroyed with it (e.g. antelopes). Willows too. Sprayed by weed-killers.The cost of chemicals are not only the price we buy them for, but that for repairing the damage they cause and loss of tourists exceeds that by many times.Road side brush control with chemicals led to the death of beautiful plants and flowers which used to grow on its sides.Effects on bees/pollinators.Selective spraying should be used instead of the destructive blanket spraying. Use of other plants to control the area instead of overusing chemicals year after year (which doesn't work on the long term). Selective spraying or use of other plants to control trees is cheaper and more effective than blanket spraying, and leads to much less poisoning of nature.24D and 245T are most used in road side. Their side effects on humans, cattle and wild life. Sprayed plants are more attractive to animals, leading to a fatal chain. High concentration of nitrates.Some plants such as Marygolds kills the Nematodes (worms) in soil.

It is transported by a bug from tree to tree. To stop the disease DDT was used against the bug.DDT > Elm trees > Earth Worms > Birds (e.g. Robins).The birds disappeared from the area as they failed to reproduce due to the toxins. Their either didn't lay eggs or their eggs did not hatch.The animals that suffered include all of those that feed on earth worms and those that feed on them.Spraying with DDT didn't save the Elm trees however and may have even hastened the spread of the disease.The strategy at Newyork which relied on sanitation and studying the bug worked much better although it wasn't as good in the beginning.The disease was invited by the single tree planting strategy.

The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modem and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.""Her style is peotic. Scientific truths presented in a peotic style which touches the feelings.She understands evolution well and treats it as given in the book, as any scientist should.I can see how books such as this which address real problems such as DDT and are actually supported by evidence, can nevertheless morph into stupid environmental movements such as those anti-GMO. The author herself is not absolutely against pesticides, but advocates using them wisely after studying their effects so that we prevent or minimize the harms associated with them.Lists many names for pesticides which are hard to remember. List many examples of the bad effects.One major question on the book is: Is this still happening? How have we dealy with these environmental issues since then? How are we doing now?Includes emotional stories about the feelings of people after their environment and animals they loved were destroyed by these chemicals.Cites reports, anecdotes, books and more to support her points.Gets really repetitive after the first third. It is really boring now at the middle and my reading rate is so slow because of this. The first third is cool, the second third repetitive and the last third is cool."

Science transform very fast, especially in last two decades, thanks to the advance of internet technology. However, this fact does not reduce the value of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson which was originally published in 1962. Although some of the substances stated in this book have been restricted, but environmentalists still refer to this book as great success in educating world society for the danger of toxic chemical for animals, living being, human and ecosystem as a whole. Reading on Silent Spring, we can learn how Ms. Carson, bring awareness of researchers, general society, farmers, journalists, and politicians on the danger of chemical substances such as DDT. Even so, as person who work in chemical business, I have objection on some Rachel Carson's opinion that generalized chemical modification as harmful while overpraise the benefit of biological approaches in this book. At the end the messages in this book finally actualized in form of ban regulation for DDT in USA by President John F. Kennedy 1972, and worldwide through Stockholm Convention in 2004. Looking on the capability of an author in driving worldwide movement is the most essential thing that I learned here. From her, I learn that nothing is impossible as long as we start our effort perhaps from just a little step of writing down our idea.

My family members should watch their drinks, apparently.]Trailblazing female marine biologist in the 1940s & 50s? Check.Thinks humans are arrogant and overstate their significance in the world? Check. Changed the world with a book? Check.Wrote a readable book for laypeople, not academics? Check.Gracefully aknowledges the significance of the “faithful help” of her housekeeper in the acknowledgements section? CHECKCHECKCHECK. Silent Spring has been on my want list for quite some time now, but it’s always one of those books that seemed non-urgent. You know nobody else is going to bring it up in conversation- it’s one of those books you get told about in grade school, but you’re never actually required to read it. You know it’s not going to go out of style or going to lose its relevance. Meanwhile, it seems very pressing to read that flashy new book that just came out before everybody forgets about it. Literary FOMO hits and Silent Spring just got pushed to the back Bunsen burner, as it were. But I am so, so happy I finally made time to read this one. Carson was painted as a “hysterical woman” according to the intro (colour. me. shocked.) and called a “bird and bunny lover.” She owned cats which of course made her suspect as a closeted spinster and a romantic. Quite contrary to hysterical, Carson is compelling,, persuasive, and lyrical. Unlike many science writers, she knows how words work and how to use them to work for her. Maybe at the beginning her message seems a tiny bit alarmist, but then she just throws a staggering- truly endless- amount of evidence at you and you’re like, No, you know what, there need to be alarms going off. One thing I did find concerning though was the eagerness with which Carson encourages using natural pest control (like introducing new species that eat them) in chemicals’ stead. Seems like a good idea, but invasive species can become major blights on both native plants and animals. Frequently the negative effects these introduced species can have are hard to predict until they’re actually brought into that complex and fragile new ecosystem, and by then it’s too late. I get that it’s a thousand times better than spraying DDT or dieldrin, but it’s still a potentially disastrous thing. Basically I’m not sure what the answer is here, but I don't feel comfortable with this proposition.I would really love to see someone write a “New Silent Spring” and address all the specific issues occurring at the time of the original’s writing, and see where exactly we stand. Cast a net out for updated, similar evidence"
280,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,5,"I first read this book almost twenty five years ago, and rereading it now confirms my opinion at that time that Carson, long viewed as one of the most influential women in America, was brilliant. In the book, Carson drew attention at the time (1962) to the damage to the environment being caused by pesticides, particularly the toxic effects of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) on the bird population. Carson’s conclusions also suggested potential harm to humans. In 1962, this was huge, and the chemical industry’s reaction to Silent Spring was, predictably, explosive. The sector was livid both by the book’s claims about its products and also by Carson’s attack on the lack of effective scrutiny of chemical companies’ activities. But Carson Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, praised Carson’s work, and organized an investigation of the industry which led ultimately to the Pesticide Control Act of 1972, which banned the use of DDT. Sadly, that was only in the United States; globally, DDT continued to be used. Also unfortunate is at almost half a century old, the book reminds the reader how the more things change, the more they stay the same. One example: we now have ""neonic"" pesticides that are a key factor in the alarming collapse of bee colonies. We have climate change deniers who spit in the face of science, and a very scary number of people who are even so ignorant that they deny evolution. This book still resonates precisely because of the current condition of our environment. Nevertheless, I take solace from other influential people today, like Pope Francis, who notably said, “Each of us has a personal responsibility to care for creation, this precious gift which God has entrusted to us. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, to enjoy and use properly. Yet it also means that we are not its masters. Stewards, but not masters. We need to love and respect nature, but instead we are often guided by the pride of dominating, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not ‘preserve’ the Earth, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a freely given gift to look after. Respect for the environment, however, means more than not destroying it; it also means using it for good purposes.”"
281,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob,5,"...After more than half a century it is always easy to poke holes into the scientific knowledge of the day. Not everything that Carson claims in her book is correct and not every solution she proposes works. That being said, the book put a subject on the agenda that very much needed to be discussed. After reading it, I feel the eternal link between DDT and Silent Spring is an oversimplification of what Carson tried to achieve. Her message was much more complex and subtle, not just raging against a particular chemical as some people want us to believe. The mere fact that this discussion is still ongoing, makes it clear that Silent Spring hasn't lost any of its relevance. Just think about the recent discussion on bee mortality and that of other pollinating insects. The knee jerk response to blame insecticides appears to be only part of the answer there. What Carson called for was an increase in knowledge, a deeper understanding of what happens when we introduce a chemical into the environment, so that we can weigh the pros and cons carefully before acting in what seems like the easiest and most immediately profitable way only to find out about the long term consequences when the damage is done. Silent Spring is a book everybody with an interest in environmental matters should read, and, after you are done, think about carefully instead of jumping on one of the bandwagons of people who use the fame of this work for their own purposes.Full Random Comments review"
282,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,5," For much of my adult life, I have pondered the relationship between commerce and art. This book caused me to ponder the intersection of commerce and science. I revere scientists who study life here on earth and increase our understanding of the physical properties of life and the universe. I understand that someone has to turn all that into systems and products that make the knowledge available to the rest of us. I abhor the impulses of greed that end up turning the knowledge into destruction. Silent Spring is another important book that shows us how that happened in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a tough read. Not because of the writing because Rachel Carson was one of the best science writers ever. She made biology and ecology comprehensible to regular people. No, it was emotionally tough, reading about all the destruction done to the natural world through the use of poisonous pesticides and herbicides. If you want to know about and understand how interconnected the natural world is, read this book. Just take it a chapter a day. That is how I made it through. She also has some amazing insights about cancer and how these poisons plus atomic radiation have played their parts in the proliferation of that disease. I have nothing against cancer research but I couldn't help thinking that more than a cure for cancer, we need a cure for our planet. Couldn't some of our bright young people figure out how to make healing the earth profitable? Actually I think many of them are working on it.  "
283,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21539577-virginia-arthur,5,"Rachel Carson is so important to me. This book is still so important not to mention it is a great American classic now. This is a must-read.This was a woman of immense courage because 'back then' you stayed in your place. Perhaps Rachel was the first activist to go up against a large corporation for the sake of the environment and we are all still reaping the results of her courage. For regulations around the application of pesticides in this country, Rachel turned the first wheel and she suffered personally from it, as all real activists do, ironically and tragically dying of cancer. The key is to keep this work rolling, move many more wheels. We cannot rely on actions of the past to protect actions of the future. We must build on those before us not only to insure their legacy but because environmental degradation is a moving target. Nothing's changed, it's still going on to the point that farmers trying to grow organic are being sued, shut down but these same corporations. What motivates a corporation to be so hateful, so vicious, so vindictive, dehumanizing--even in the fact that it is run by humans? Maybe this is the real question.The introduction talks about a world without life--a pretty scene---but nothing living it it. We're almost there."

285,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,5,"I had to set this book down many times to research the details. Did airplanes really spray chemicals over cities in the 50s and 60s? (answer: yes.) What is the modern method of dealing with fire ants? (answer: basically what Rachel Carson recommends in this book). Whatever happened to Rachel Carson anyway? (answer: she died of cancer just a few years after this book came out. Her voice in Silent Spring has a certain desperation about it--and understandably so.)While at times I felt she leaned a little too hard on emotion (as if birdsong on its own has value beyond sentiment--says at least one of your relatives, I'll bet), but the research she brings to the table to prove the value of those birds in the grand scheme of things was cutting edge at the time of publication, and rightly caused a commotion. I'm glad I read this book now, and not when it first came out over 50 years ago. It gives me hope that things society once considered givens, like the safety of air-sprayed pesticides, can change within a generation. *fingers crossed*"

However, Carson's main points are still valid and powerfully put. She helped create the environmental movement which many now take for granted. While I am pleased to know that some of the threats she described have been reversed or avoided (such as the recovery of many bird & fish species from the effects of DDT), I was still appalled by the hazards that pesticides & herbicides posed then & probably still do. I was also left with a strong feeling that the USDA and other governmental agencies of the 1940-60 period were rife with corruption -- I don't know if this was ever investigated but I sure hope that there is more oversight on these agencies now!Carson does an amazing job of giving explanations of some basic biology as well as the plentiful descriptions of case studies. Well worth reading."

290,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54083442-horace-derwent,5,"one of the most important books in history and it did change the history, nothing else to say"
291,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Silent Spring (1962), Rachel Carson successfully awakened Americans to harmful unintended consequences posed by the pesticide DDT. She explains how DDT works and graphically details what happens when this ""elixir of death"" kills off its intended targets and then accumulates in the tissue of birds, fish, and humans. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States, though they continued to produce and sell it to other countries that did not ban it.Silent Spring is a seminal text on environmentalism and many of its messages endure. Greta Thunberg, like Carson, objects to the hypocrisy of asking students to listen to scientists when governments ignore their warnings. Today's judicial activists, like Carson, note that the founding fathers could not have foreseen what we would today call the tragedy of the commons when drafting the constitution. In The Discovery of Global Warming Weart, like Carson does here, mentions how difficult it was to study planetary systems from within the specialized scientific disciplines. Crutzen suggested that our carbon emissions created a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is not so far from Carson's warning that our total control of nature can be dangerous. Carson likens insecticides to radioactive waste, which, for better or (imho) worse, has remained an association for many greens. We worry a lot about bee populations today, and Carson points out that indiscriminately wiping out large swaths of flowers (""weeds"") will harm bees. Today, we teach students about bioaccumulation and biomagnification, processes she describes in the book at length. She correctly predicts that insects and weeds will develop resistance to pesticides. Her critics, often libertarians and conservatives, portray her as shortsighted or mildly hysterical, but I was impressed by how much she got right and how much she saw.Carson's rhetorical structure has also endured. She imagines two paths, a bucolic idyll and a deadened industrial dystopia. DDT was banned, but we have mostly pursued the latter path. Sadly, the idea that people, excepting bird watchers of course, might today miss innocent spring bird song is laughably naive, and if anything their absence is probably accepted as normal due to shifting baseline syndrome. Regardless, many green and promethean texts continue to rely on either/or frameworks, but I think the choice framework fails for two reasons. First, continuums are more useful than opposing targets. Second, Carson's depictions of DDT within organs are sufficiently disgusting that the reader wants to act to maintain their health--few care about an idyll. If DDT could be used without collecting in our bodies, I'm not sure people would care. (In fact, I would expect conservatives to make some form of this case in promoting any pesticide.) In this sense, Silent Spring is better likened to Sinclair's The Jungle than most environmental texts.I interpret Silent Spring as providing evidence against the notion of people as stewards or managers of the environment, ban or no ban. At one point, Carson is disgusted by the way that people use DDT as a quick solution to every problem. Discussing crabgrass, for example, she suggests that people should invest greater care in the quality of their soil to produce a healthier lawn rather than spraying poison on everything. The notion that large swaths of people will learn all of the complexity of soil or of interlocking ecological systems strikes me as tragically ridiculous. People pride themselves on being intelligent, but it seems obvious to me that they'd rather view ecosystems as simple input/ output ratios than as complex interlocking systems. Ecologists and gardeners seem to have lost their status relative to, say, economists and financial analysts. The latter groups are associated with money but they also excel at summarizing their conclusions in succinct bottom lines. Although there are ways of maximizing soil productivity through highly skilled intensive management, the green revolution has reduced agriculture to a simpler equation based largely on synthetic inputs.Ultimately, many species, including the bald eagle, did rebound after the DDT ban. Silent Spring is engaging on its own merit, and it also deserves its hype."
292,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211348-jeff,4,"I picked up Silent Spring knowing it would make me angry, but thinking it was a book focused mostly on the bird populations affected by DDT. The first assumption held true, although I am sure its intention was to make me active, not just angry. The second assumption could not have been more wrong. Birds are included, but the book meticulously analyzes mankind’s efforts to control bugs, plants, and mammalian pests to the devastating detriment of other bugs, plants, animals, and ourselves.Focused glimpses into man’s hubris and lust for the dollar, it in turn reveals his follies and failures in the name of quick fixes, ignorant of long term consequences of actions.The science was a heavy in the middle chapters—easy to follow, if the eyelids stay up. But some of that is to be expected from a lifelong biologist. The formal repetition of chapter structure lacks entertainment, but is a necessary frame to the big picture. If read in the context of its historical importance, without a predetermined agenda from the reader, Silent Spring will reveal itself for the important and classic collection of research and work of literature that it has become in the decades since its release."
293,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,This book is one of the two seminal texts of the environmental movement (the other being Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac). When it was first published in 1962 it exploded in the country...and I wondered if it still had the same impact 57 years later. And I could assure you it certainly had. The chemical industry which was pumping tom of carcinogenic chemicals onto US soil was stopped dead in its tracks.I decided to reread the book because the Fool in the White House (like Voldemort I cannot speak his name!) has decided to allow the chemical industry to release some deadly chemicals again onto US soil. And so another generation needs to hear this powerful message again. Even though Carson's text is filled with a great deal of scientific information (much of it superseded by new findings in the past half-century) the effect fo this book is overwhelming. If you care about the world's environment...read this book!!
294,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16850238-alex,5,"This is one of those books that change the way you see the world. I had read about Silent Spring for a while now but finally decided to take the plunge. The only regret I have is not reading it earlier. The blend between Carson's extraordinarily poetic prose and her deep knowledge of the subject is the perfect mix for this book. She delivers a brutal criticism of the use of toxic chemicals in our environment, but she does that from a position of science and literature. Her effort to aggregate all the disparate pieces of research under a single home and weave a coherent, simple and beautiful narrative is astounding. No wonder she was the recipient of the National Book Award in 1952 for her previous book.A definitely must read that's more relevant than ever before. Our fight against pesticides and toxic chemicals is still real and the threat, sadly, hasn't gone away but rather, it's been enlarged by globalization. "
295,0618249060,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,5,"A case can be made for Silent Spring being the most influential popular science book ever written. Published in 1962, it’s referenced in every book I’ve read about environmental issues. It’s theme is the misuse of synthetic pesticides and the terrible damage that they do to the natural environment and, ultimately, to people. Rachel Carson rages against industrial farming methods; the chemical industry and commercial interests; derelict governance; a slavish, unthinking belief in technology; and the resulting ‘habit of killing’ into which farmers, local authorities and all those charged with managing the natural environment seemed to fall in the 1940s, 50s and 60s (and possibly still do). Her gift was being able to explain both the fundamental science – the synthetic molecules themselves and the processes by which they, for example, disrupt the mitochondria in living cells and by which they cause cancers – and the essential interconnectedness of living things (the ‘ecosystem’) but also to deliver an elegy to the lost beauty of our shared natural heritage. Take this passage on the damage to the natural flora of roadside verges in the US: Azaleas, mountain laurel, blueberries, viburnums, dogwood, bay berry, sweet fern, low shad bush, winterberry, chokeberry and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, golden rods and autumn asters which lend grace and beauty to the landscape … such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals.No other book has done more to raise environmental issues in the public consciousness. Carson died a couple of years after the book was published and this (1999) edition includes a short afterword by Linda Lear of George Washington University reflecting on her legacy. Lear calls Carson ‘a social prophet’ because Silent Spring wasn’t just a book about pesticides, its message was that those in authority can’t always be trusted to protect us or the world in which we live. She was also an educated woman publicly challenging the male-dominated worlds of science, industry and government, and explicitly throughout the book directing her anger at the men in charge. She wasn’t anti-science, she was pro-evidence, and all of her key positions and arguments are just as relevant, and urgent, today as they were more than half a century ago. Astonishing.(Short foot note for arachnophobes: in a section about how encouraging predators can be a more effective biological method of managing pests, Carson mentions that a ‘biologically sound’ forest should have 50-150 spiders per square metre. Think about that the next time you stop to eat your sandwiches in Dingly Dell)."

I decided to finally sit down and read this book to see what all the hullabaloo was about, and HOLY COW! If I had been living in that decade, and read about all this stuff AS it was happening, I'd have been freaking out and calling for changes too. There was some seriously scary stuff in there.Even though the book and its issues were somewhat dated (most of the chemicals targeted by this book have since been banned, and are no longer in use in the US), it was still very interesting, and kept me captivated throughout. Some parts were particularly laughable in their naievete and datedness - like the part where the author was horrified that there had been recently developed a pill that could make dogs' blood/bodies poisonous to fleas as a form of flea eradication (commonly done today), and she deduced that the next step would be for humans to poison themselves to make themselves distastful to mosquitos. HeheI was mildly disturbed by her strong support of introducing predators from a non-native species' native environment as the preferable means of controlling invasive insect species. While she was able to cite several wonderful success stories for this technique, we now know that all to often this ends in disaster, with the imported predator either preferring one of our native species (sometimes the very one we were trying to save) thus leaving the target prey to continue its life cycle unimpeded, or the imported predator's population expanding to a number that is more troublesome than the problem they were brought in to address (think cane toad).Overall, though, I have to say this book was very *very* well written. The amount of research that went into this book is staggering, and Rachel Carson seems to have a gift for taking a complicated concept and putting it into words that the average person could understand and (perhaps even more importantly) relate to. Its very easy to see why this book created the stir that it did, at the time when it was written. Even today, I found myself horrified by events revealed within its covers. 50 years later, it is still worth reading."

At the same time, I have two main problems with it, both of which are instances of my holding Carson up to today's standards. Not fair you say? Of course it's fair. First, a caution about any enthusiastic embrace of Carson's proposed solutions. Biological meddling (as we've well learned in the 50ish years since Silent Spring's publication) can have results even more disastrous than indiscriminate chemical spraying, with the cane toad in Australia being the most vivid example that comes to mind.Second, any environmental movement is doomed to failure unless it includes humans as equal partners in the earth's ecology. While Carson points out the arrogance of humans' tendency to want to control nature, she does little to show how humans are equal partners with living things. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to come up with any examples where environmentalists stop using arguments citing self-interest and show how the environment needs humans just as much as we need the environment. Until that day comes, I have little hope for the adoption of new, ecologically-friendly values. Should Carson be associated with this kind of critique? In a venue like this, yes. So many look to this book as not only the beginning of environmentalism, but its bible, its beginning AND end. Since this site is designed with the sharing of books in mind, I thought I'd dissuade others from what I see as a misuse and a misreading of this text. "

The struggle has always existed, but the costs of failures have certainly escalated beyond imagination since WWII:--The updated (2016) go-to book on the environmental crisis, synthesizing Earth Systems science with political economy: Facing the Anthropocene: Fossil Capitalism and the Crisis of the Earth System--Chomsky on the 21st century and beyond:  Nuclear War and Environmental Catastrophe). This book was one step in the modern struggle, and the most-recent corporate backlash (detailed in  Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming) reveal the present as what it always is, a continuation of history."
