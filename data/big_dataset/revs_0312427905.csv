A: Find a remote wilderness and build a cabin. Add a few chickens, goats, cows ect. and live off the land with as much peace of mind you can muster until man destroys the planet. Or B. Say ""AWWW F**K IT"", and put all regular, old fashioned light bulbs in all your lamps and turn them on. Leave your house, with the air conditioner running, get in your Hummer, and drive across the country…..just because you can. Eat as much factory farmed meat as you can stand on the way…..’cause you are crazy like that! Steal a truck loaded with nuclear waste and drive it Thelma and Louise style into the Grand Canyon, committing a spectacular environmental suicide. I feel better now. This book is a very good book, but it is a tad, well, depressing. I recommend it because (not only do I want to drag you down with me) of its important information. We all need to be informed. The World Without Us examines what the earth would be like if man were to just disappear. How long would it take the earth to rid itself of all traces of us? Turns out not very long geologically, but bronze statues and Barbie and Ken in the landfill will stand the test of time. One point the author makes, our problems (well most of them) could be fixed, or greatly improved, if all women of child bearing age would agree to have just one child. I don’t see this happening but, I do think maybe we should stop glorifying women who have litters of children. That would be a start."
1,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277214-mateo,5,"Yeah, what you've heard about this book is true: It really is very good, very scary, very depressing--AND it's written entirely in Spurdlish, a language I just made up that consists only of the letter 't'. If it only enabled fire ants to slowly liquify Dick Cheney, it would be perfect. Okay, I'm kidding about the Spurdlish, but, yeah, great book. Weisman doesn't just speculate on what happens to your house or the NYC subways or the pyramids once we've all been raptured off to Heaven. (Hint: That expensive kitchen remodel you did? Hopefully it's in a color that raptors enjoy.) The book is really about what we're doing to the planet, and how long our nefarious activities will outlast us. The news is both good and bad: nature tends to adapt to just about anything--think wildflowers blooming in Chernobyl--but there are still some future scenarios that are pretty hellish. Yes. More hellish than Boca Raton, Florida. Between the PCBs, the fluorocarbons, the dioxins, the plutonium, the global warming, and those uncounted zillions of plastic microparticles now gutting everything from krill to blue whales, the planet's in for a rough ride for a while, even if aliens appear in the skies tomorrow and suck us up through the galaxy's biggest straw.Weisman writes quite well and the panoply of places he visits is worth the price of admission: reserves in Kenya, the Korean DMZ, the Panama Canal, the American Southwest, Turkish caves, Pacific atolls, etc., etc. I'm glad someone could write about them before they're swallowed up in Pepsi bottles and plastic bags. It's tempting, when reading the book, to take the long view of things, that the Earth endures and that if we disappear from our own foolishness, it's no great loss. In fact, it's hard to escape the conclusion that we deserve extinction for all that we're doing. And yet that seems to me to be both simplistic and disingenuous. For all the evil we've done through our greed, our cruelty, and our shortsightedness, we have produced some real marvels, whether it's the Parthenon or a newborn child. We are a remarkable species, perhaps unreplaceable, and it will be a loss to the biosphere when we go. Of course, in the end all things must pass, as some Liverpool philosopher once put it, but the end is not yet here and there's still much to enjoy. (Do those who wish an end to humanity really believe what they say? Who amongst them is willing to commit suicide for the sake of a better planet?) Let's hope that we gain the wisdom to enjoy it all, and preserve it for a better future. "

"
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya,4,"This is a worldwide documentary book, in the fashion of Jacques Cousteau, or more recently a few BBC programs. The inciting question is a bit strange: what would happen, should the whole of the human race suddenly vanish from the face of the Earth? Of course, even if entire populations could be decimated by war or natural catastrophes, an utter extinction of the human race is a highly improbable event. Yet, this odd hypothesis is a way of exploring how much humanity’s footprint has changed and is still changing this planet, and reflect on the possible legacy of our current global civilisation.Weisman, a journalist and nonfiction writer, investigates different aspects of this question. He starts off pointing out how much human beings since they left their African cradle, have changed their environment. One illustration being the mass animal extinctions, due to human development, that have already taken place since prehistorical times (e.g. the giant proboscideans of the Holocene). These extinctions have been going on, presumably at an ever-increasing pace, up to the present time. But if human beings disappeared, what would happen in the immediate aftermath or in the farthest future? What would become of our houses, our sometimes massive megalopolis? What would become of the unfathomable amount of waste (mainly plastic waste) that we are continually dumping into the soil and the ocean? What would become of our highly hazardous petrochemical and nuclear facilities? What would become of our most significant achievements to transform the environment? What would become of the climate of our planet, that (despite the outrageous and deceitful denial of some politicians in recent times) we are contributing to change in radical ways? What will become of our intellectual and artistic legacy?Weisman has travelled the world to find some answers, from New-York to the Panama Canal, from Korea to Cyprus and from Houston to the atolls of the Pacific Ocean, and overall his research is well documented albeit easy to read. What I take away from this book is that, should we suddenly depart, we would leave the Earth in a pretty disastrous state. But in time, perhaps a very long time (possibly millions of years), wild nature would wipe away almost all memory of our presence on this planet. The hitch is that, for now, we are still around and more and more so: what calamity we might well leave behind will sadly be for our descendants to live or die with and, hopefully, mend. It seems Weisman's more recent book advocates some form of demographic decline, as a solution to this massive issue…"
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/739464-colin-mckay-miller,2,"In The World Without Us, Alan Weisman attempts to answer the question of what would happen to the earth if, for whatever reason, humans were to completely disappear tomorrow. While it’s a fascinating premise, one that Weisman undoubtedly put a lot of time and effort into, the execution falters. Inevitably, it’s hard to stretch what was initially a short essay into a full book, but that’s how The World Without Us got going. Structurally, the book is broken down into four parts with chapters discussing what would happen to the earth, both in the manmade and in what man has altered in nature, including cities, power plants, nukes, art, farmland, bacteria, animals and creatures of the ocean. In reading this book it’s clear that Weisman realized that, a) that it’s strange to read a book without any people; and b) in order to predict the future, you must delve into the past. As a result of this, The World Without Us is more about history than the future. Weisman interviews a number of people from all walks of life/viewpoints and there’s a fat bibliography at the end. He strives for accuracy in his predictions, even though it’s based on what we currently know. It’s like when you see a science fiction movie: all the future computers are still based on the technology we have available now. Though Weisman succeeds in not being preachy, the theories he presents are still debatable. There are a few areas I’d argue with him and since time has gone by since publication, recent history is contending to debate with his theories, too. In certain parts though, as with the section on Galveston, TX (hit with a massive hurricane in 1900, then again in 2008, a year after the book was published), Weisman’s assertions remain true. So what’s the problem then? The World Without Us has a great premise, is well researched and historically accurate (depending on who you ask today), but it’s not all that interesting. It seems like Alan Weisman realized it, too, as the hook chapters to each part are far more interesting than the remainder of each section (save the terse final part which is fairly solid throughout). You get drawn in by a few fascinating chapters, then you have to wade through the meandering text until the next hook spikes interest. I’d find my mind wandering, wishing it were more of dystopian fiction based on environmentalism. Maybe that means I should just stay away from nonfiction science books where inevitably, after enough time has gone by and enough new data has popped up, it’ll be laughed off the shelf. Two stars. Barely. "
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/780526-marcus,2,"I enjoyed the premise, but the execution was a snoozer. I'm not sure if it was the author's soporific style, or that I was let down by his overly repetitive rundown on floral succession: ""asparagus and trumpet vine take hold as dingleberries and snorfle-weed provide shade..."" Over and over; it felt like the author was attempting to display the fact that he did thorough investigation with environmental biologists and was flexing his bio street cred, After the first 4 times, the remaining 18 were overkill.I did learn that there's a voluntary human extinction movement, something I found interesting and hadn't heard of before. Of course, he only devoted 1 paragraph of the book to something that was actually novel and interesting. I also enjoyed the exploration of human works in a human-less scenario (what would happen to subways, oil wells, nuclear power plants, statues, domestic farms, dams, etc.) but felt that the author took few risks. For example, he might have investigated what the probabilities were for a human extinction scenario. I understand that that may not have been crucial to his discussion of a world already without humans, but without discussing what would bring about that scenario, the book is little more than one of those semi-drunk, ""what-if"" imagination games you play while sitting at a bar. ""If you were trapped on a deserted island . . .""To say the book ended with a whimper would be an understatement. It felt like he was just tired of writing, or that his editor said he needed to put the thing to bed. Either way, it was mildly entertaining and mildly educational, meaning it was also mildly a waste of time."
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"Well written and researched exploration of the premise of how the world would change if humans suddenly disappeared from the earth. This ostensible absurd premise turns out to be a very useful lens to view many important environmental and ecological issues. Several chapters, such as those on plastics and nuclear waste, are distressing as their impacts are incalculably long lasting. The ones on how fast pockets of biodiversity might spread or how quickly highly stressed areas might recover are reassuring. Weisman gets a lot of help from an army of experts and does well to make the focus of each chapter come from the first person perspectives of relevant field or laboratory scientists. The diverse riffs on urban sites include an abandoned city in the Turkish zone of Cyprus, which after a few decades appears to be disassembled surprisingly fast by the forces of nature. The virtual disappearance of great Mayan cities into the jungle is another fascinating example of the ephemeral quality of civilizations. The human-caused extinctions of so many species are obviously not reversible, but the fate of domestic animals, agricultural species, and alien species introduced far and wide make great subjects of his creative speculations from historical and evolutionary perspectives. A consideration of what human-made structures will last the longest turns up some surprises. The Panama Canal apparently won't last long, but many structures made of stone, bronze, or ceramic will persist until crumbled by another ice age or tectonic folding. A nice coda to the book is a reflection on how the examples of human literature and music sent out of the solar system with the Voyager spacecraft will likely outlast the sun.Update Weisman is back on the job pondering Earth's fate with a follow-up that puts people back into the picture. I look forward to reading his account of the challenge of overpopulation of our planet, published at the end of Sept. 2013:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17...Countdown: Our Last Best Hope for a Future on Earth?"
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,4,"This book is a tour de force of ""what ifs"" based on scientific facts mixed with scientific guesses. The premise is unusual.....what if humans suddenly were no longer on the earth. Not dead by plague, war, or natural disaster but simply disappearing tomorrow, leaving no bodies. But what humans leave behind will change the Earth as we know it, forever.Environmentalist have been fighting battles to save the planet for years but the damage has partially been done. Huge whirlpools of garbage, miles wide, already dot both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the majority of the material in those floating garbage dumps is plastic based. The author gives quite a bit of information about what effect non-biodegradables will have on every thing from plant life to animal life (remember, only humans have disappeared).The second huge consequence of human ""progress"" will be the nuclear missiles, power plants, and nuclear waste that remains with no one left to regulate it to prevent detonation. Humans have already gotten a bit of a taste as to what might happen based on the Chernobyl accident. Magnify it worldwide and it is beyond comprehension.Animal life will continue but not in the form that we now recognize, as species struggle to adapt to changing weather patterns and availability of food sources.....reindeer in France and elephants in Russia are possible scenarios.This book is not too scientific for the layman while still delving into scientific thought and theory. An engrossing look at what the human race may leave behind which is, to say the least, horrifying. Recommended. "

Just if you might be interested.A bonanza of ideas for science fiction and downscale world scenarios that describes the various aspects of the tooth of the time following a fictional extinction of humans.The explanation begins with the immediate knock-on effects after day X, with incoming indoor plants and water-rich mines and infrastructures such as subways being among the first concomitants before the emergency generators in all the facilities necessary for the maintenance of a western industrialized society run out of fuel and all formerly regulated processes become independent. After all highly reactive and dangerous operations have come to a spectacular end, a decay of relatively inferior constructed infrastructure begins, as compared to the buildings of antiquity and the Middle Ages were built of natural materials. Do not even consider reinforced concrete, which actually implies the name. One of the crucial factors here is the penetration of water after rotting roofs, which significantly increases the speed of disassembly. At the same time, to the slow disappearance and decay of all civilizing achievements, nature enters the scene and conquers both once their entranced areas back and, at the same time, actively participates in advance of the decay. In this case, plants are involved in the fouling of vegetation and the immense power of their roots, as well as microorganisms and, to a lesser extent, animals themselves.In the broadest sense, the description of late revenge of sentient beings, which could save themselves from the extinction of their species by man and now fervently help to erase the last evidence of its existence from the face of the earth. And in a relatively short time, after a few hundred or even a few thousand years, nothing remains of the grandiose structures of the former crown of creation. The long-term greetings of people to the future in the form of industrial plants and nuclear power plants are also explained, and the aspect of highly dangerous effects of malfunctions and the resulting masses of GAUs in massive industrial complexes is one of the most remarkable ideas of the work. At such sites, accidents occurred despite human maintenance and control.The absence of all maintenance measures would result in widespread pollution of the environment within a short period of time. Even secure and well-protected sites, repositories and systems built with high-quality building materials would pay tribute to the passing of the years and at some point be damaged, rusted and thus time bombs. What bothers me is the lack of visible distinction between fiction, proven facts, and previously unconfirmed assumptions, which makes it difficult to judge the book's reading value. So it is difficult to recognize, which is the fantasy of Weisman or historically proven and observed by the example of extinct high cultures facts. Other authors solve this problem by incorporating fictive short stories clearly labeled as such, to illustrate these, or by referring to sources in individual thoughts and passages. Unfortunately, the various aspects are explained individually, but not at the end assembled into a single image of the respective levels of degeneracy, including all elements, which could have given a better and more vivid overview.Besides, the extreme penchant for accurate explanation is sometimes lengthy and overweight concerning the actually eponymous book content. On the way to the downfall in all its stages has been explained many times fictional and including real factors. The description of the exact situation after the final decline in the distant future, the reader's actual expectation of the real-life world of animals and plants and other effects fall through the rust and take barely one-eighth on nearly 400 pages. What a pity, as it would have made no difference due to the lack of differentiation between utopia and reality, even more, spread of the hoped-for by the relevant reading client future scenarios and present them in more detail and with the inclusion of facts on better footing foundation. Unfortunately, in otherwise excellent work, a lot of potentials is given away, a weighting in favor of less unnecessary detail and more promised content would have done very well.Detaillierte Reise in eine wieder sehr naturverbundene, menschenleere Zukunft Eine Goldgrube an Ideen für durch Science Fiction- und Weltuntergansszenarien affektierte Leser, die die verschiedensten Aspekte des Zahnes der Zeit nach einem fiktionalen Aussterben der Menschen beschreibt. Die Erläuterung beginnt mit den unmittelbaren Folgewirkungen nach Tag X, wobei eingehende Zimmerpflanzen und mit Wasser vollaufende Bergwerke und Infrastrukturen wie U-Bahnen zu den ersten Begleiterscheinungen zählen, bevor den Notstromaggregaten in sämtlichen, für die Aufrechterhaltung einer westlichen Industriegesellschaft notwendigen Anlagen, der Treibstoff ausgeht und sich alle bisher regulierten Prozesse verselbstständigen. Nachdem sämtliche hochreaktiven und gefährlichen Vorgänge ein spektakuläres Ende gefunden haben, beginnt ein steter Zerfall von, im Vergleich zu den aus Naturmaterialien errichteten Bauwerken der Antike und des Mittelalters, verhältnismäßig minderwertig konstruierter Infrastruktur. Hält doch selbst Stahlbeton nicht, was der Name eigentlich impliziert. Einer der entscheidenden Faktoren hierbei ist das Eindringen des Wassers nach dem Verrotten der Dächer, durch die sich die Demontagegeschwindigkeit wesentlich erhöht. Gleichzeitig, zum langsamen Schwinden und Verfallen aller zivilisatorischen Errungenschaften, tritt die Natur auf den Plan und erobert sowohl einst ihr entrungene Gebiete zurück als auch gleichzeitig bei einem Voranschreiten des Verfalls tatkräftig mitzuwirken. Hierbei sind sowohl Pflanzen dank ihres für bereits angeschlagene Gebäude verheerenden Gewichts bei Bewuchs und der immensen Kraft ihrer Wurzeln, als auch Mikroorganismen und in geringem Ausmaß, Tiere selbst beteiligt. Im weitesten Sinn die Beschreibung einer späten Rache der Lebewesen, die sich vor der Auslöschung ihrer Art durch den Menschen retten konnten und nun voller Inbrunst helfen, die letzten Belege seiner Existenz vom Antlitz der Erde tilgen. Und in verhältnismäßig kurzer Zeit noch dazu, nach ein paar hundert bis paar tausend Jahren ist nicht mehr das Geringste übrig von den grandiosen Bauwerken der einstigen Krone der Schöpfung.Auch die Langzeitgrüße der Menschen an die Zukunft in Form von Industrieanlagen und Atomkraftwerken werden erläutert und der Aspekt hochgradig gefährlicher Auswirkungen von Fehlfunktionen und daraus resultierenden, massenhaften GAUs in gigantischen Industriekomplexen zählt zu einer der bemerkenswertesten Ideen des Werks. An solchen Stätten kam es trotz menschlicher Wartung und Kontrolle zu UnfällenEin Ausbleiben sämtlicher Instandhaltungsmaßnahmen würde innerhalb eines kurzen Zeitraums zur weitläufigen Verseuchung der Umwelt führen. Selbst gesicherte und in gut geschützten Lagen errichtete Endlagerstätten, Depots und mit hochwertigen Baustoffen errichtete Systeme würden dem Voranschreiten der Jahre Tribut zollen und irgendwann beschädigt, verrostet und damit zu Zeitbomben werden.Was stört, ist die fehlende sichtbare Unterscheidung von Fiktion, belegten Fakten und bisher unbestätigten Vermutungen, wodurch man bei der Beurteilung des Lehrwerts des Buches leider hart mit dem Autor ins Gericht gehen muss. So fällt es schwer zu erkennen, wobei es sich um die Fantasie Weismans oder um historisch belegte und am Beispiel untergegangener Hochkulturen beobachtete Tatsachen handelt. Andere Autoren lösen dies, indem sie als solche deutlich gekennzeichnete, fiktive Kurzgeschichten einbauen, um Thesen zu veranschaulichen, oder indem bei einzelnen Gedanken und Abschnitten mittels Fußnote auf Quellen verwiesen wird. Leider werden die verschiedenen Aspekte zwar einzeln erläutert, aber nicht am Ende zu einem einheitlichen Bild der jeweiligen Degenerationsstufen unter Einbezug aller Aspekte zusammengefügt, was einen besseren und anschaulicheren Überblick hätte vermitteln können.Daneben ist der extreme Hang zur minutiösen Erläuterung mitunter langatmig und auch im Verhältnis zu den eigentlich titelgebenden Buchinhalt übergewichtet. Denn der Weg in den Untergang in all seinen Stadien wurde schon vielfach fiktional und auch unter Einbeziehung realer Faktoren erläutert. Die Beschreibung der genauen Situation nach dem endgültigen Niedergang in ferner Zukunft, die eigentlich dem Leser suggerierte Erwartung auf die genauen Lebenswelten von Tieren und Pflanzen und andere Auswirkungen fallen durch den Rost und nehmen auf knapp 400 Seiten kaum ein Achtel ein. Was schade ist, da es aufgrund der mangelnden Differenzierung zwischen Utopie und Realität keinen Unterschied gemacht hätte, noch mehr der, von der einschlägigen Leseklientel erhofften Zukunftsszenarien auszubreiten und diese vor allem detaillierter und unter Einbeziehung von Fakten auf besser fußendem Fundament darzustellen. So wird leider in einem ansonsten feinen Werk viel Potential verschenkt, dem eine Gewichtung zugunsten weniger unnötiger Detailfülle und mehr versprochenem Inhalt sehr gut getan hätte."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,2,"The Coda (last chapter) should probably be read first as it sums up the thrust of the book & it's not what the description & title suggest. It started out as billed, a look at what the world would look like if we disappeared, but devolved into a platform for an environmental rant with some snide political remarks thrown in. If it was a little better balanced & thorough or if it offered any solutions, I'd like it more since I'm a tree hugger, too. It's generally negative, though. He doesn't seem to like the human race much. It was great that his examples are drawn from all around the world, but if this wasn't an audio book, I would have abandoned it by the half mark. Weisman obviously isn't a scientist, although he spent time with some fascinating ones in preparing this book. Too many of his statements are poorly phrased & his presentation shows far too much bias. I'm not a scientist either, but I knew enough about several topics to catch him & did a bit of research several other times his logic seemed strained. Both literally & figuratively, he often can't see the forest for the trees. Worse, he often doesn't try, but anyone with a modicum of curiosity will find a variety of interesting ideas to research more on their own.He does a great job in showing that many of our large works are not as permanent as they seem. Most exist only because of continual, often massive maintenance. Perhaps the best example of this is the Panama Canal. He devotes a fair amount of space to discussing just how quickly the rain & jungle would wash it away. Unfortunately, the entire section is weakened by his snide outline of U.S. foreign policy, a topic he had no business addressing in this book, especially in such a cavalier fashion. It simply proved his bias.Some of our changes to the environment are obvious & horrible, the best example being the ocean sinks & coral beds that are choked with plastics & other polymers. Some are invisible, but just as or more deadly, & will last practically forever, such as in the case of dioxins & PCBs. Others may make radical changes that will last for centuries, such as lime or other changes to the soil that change the order & types of regrowth, if we were to disappear. These he condemns without fully discussing how much the exact composition really matters from the larger perspective, though.I'm no happier than he is about the extinction of the American Chestnut or Passenger Pigeon, but other species have taken their ecological niches, for better or worse. I doubt the squirrels are upset over having to eat more acorns & hickory nuts rather than chestnuts, though. Rock doves & starlings have filled in for the Passenger Pigeon, haven't they? If not, what is still out of balance? I wish he would have addressed this more fully, but much of it is guess work & he tended to just write it off as bad. I was intrigued by his examples of how much man changed nature even before the Industrial Revolution. For instance, each wave of immigrants to the Americas has made huge changes. Clovis Man (first wave) may well be the cause of the extinction of the mega-mammals either through hunting or disease, a rather interesting parallel with our (fourth wave) immigration & its effects on the second & third wave immigrants (AKA Native Americans), although he only vaguely alludes to it. He also points out some other fallacies in our current perceptions about what 'natural' ecosystems were like over the ages. He didn't go into enough detail on some. For instance, it would have been nice if he had researched desertification a bit more. He points out the most obvious causes, but missed others. He especially missed all the efforts aimed at eradicating it which is far more instructive for a natural recovery.Unfortunately, his agenda continually skews & limits his facts. For instance, his distaste for electrical generation disrupting the natural environment is obvious. Coal & nuclear plants are targeted many times over the course of the book. He never mentions what the alternatives are besides doing without, though. Hydro-electric dams & wind turbines are never mentioned at all, yet he spends a lot of time pointing out that radio & cell towers kill possibly a billion birds each year with their flashing red lights, electromagnetic radiation, & guy wires. Wind turbines combine not only all the hazards of the others, but add in spinning blades. Unlike the other towers where dead birds are usually quickly cleaned up by scavengers, wind turbines often have so many piled up that crews have to remove them. I can only conclude that he likes them because they're 'clean' energy & thus he again proves his bias.Many of his opinions on the survival of species don't make sense to me. In the beginning he says our cattle, goats, horses, & dogs will probably die out once we are gone yet there are plenty of examples of all of these species going feral successfully. He doesn't mention pigs or sheep at all, but they are two of the most extreme examples. Feral hogs are notoriously capable & destructive (Now a real problem in my area.) while most sheep would die immediately. He does discuss the dangers of the common house cat to the environment, although they are in a different section, one dealing with his love of birds. (Toward the end he changed this somewhat & briefly mentioned pigs.)So overall, I can't give this book the high rating some of the facts & research deserve. They're just too badly skewed. As food for thought, it has some points of interest, but most facts & every opinion should be taken with a large dose of salts. It's certainly not definitive, but could serve as a springboard for more thorough research on any topics of interest."

I simply can't get over how fantastic, informative, well-written, and mind-opening it is. Wow, where do I start?The book revolves around the hypothetical question: What would happen if all humans disappeared tomorrow? Would anything we created survive? Would anything miss us?The short answer is: very little, not really. It's a blow to our ego perhaps, but true nevertheless. The only creatures who are dependent on us for survival are the miniscule mites that live on and in our bodies, eating our dead skin cells before we suffocate in them, and nasty bacterias.This is not a doomsday book. It's actually playfully optimistic, and is more of a history and science lesson than a judgement on our sins. Though the evidence is plentiful that we are in fact killing the planet that sustains us.Weisman covers everything from our leaky homes - describing in detail exactly how they would fall apart without our constant care - to the early years of home sapiens and our impact on wildlife; from art to nuclear power to the oceans. I learnt so much, my head is literally buzzing. Some of it is downright scary, but I'm not one to put my head in the sand and expect someone else to take care of it all.If you're interested in history, science, environmentalism, impressing people at dinner parties with your knowledge or just plain interested: this is the book for you!"
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"This book was very informative but a little bit naive in it approach. I don't think that humans are going anywhere in the near future so drawing conclusions from an scenario that will likely never happen seems a little bit masturbatory but at least among all the information in this book , there is some usefulness. It is also very good to gain knowledge about the fauna and flora that went extinct because of human involvement. And I was surprised by the conclusion of the book where it stated that the one solution that would work both for nature an humanity is to restrict all females in the world to just one offspring. A conclusion that while it would work pragmatically, I think it is at best a pipe dream . "

So us westerners have left depleted uranium with a half life of 4.5 billion years all over Iraq and expect them to like us? Ha! I had no idea of the ramifications of depleted uranium, heck the science side of this has passed me by. Stupid me. How could I have not given thought to armour piecing weaponry that leaves radiation traces of a half life of 4.5 billion years. Depending on who one wants to believe all that for either getting rid of weapons of mass destruction and/or getting hold of all that oil. Did I mention a half life of 4.5 billion years? Oh I did? Well according to this there is half a million tons of the stuff still lying around the US alone. Is it/was it worth it? Going to take a lot of convincing for this little black duck. But lets not worry about that and look at all those nice buildings and monuments and various other man-made items that our species is so proud of. Once we are gone? They all go except maybe Mount Rushmore. That Panama Canal. Did I say that those weapons we have been using in the middle east leave radiation with a half life of 4.5 billion years? Oh yeah I did. Oh well at least a really nice ditch we have dug will fall over after only about 100 years if there is no one around to look after it and not long after no one will ever know of it's existence. Yeah good book but pity about that last chapter and it's mystical electro magmatic brain wave stuff. I am sure the author meant well. "

Most of the book was about the world before humans and about how we have changed it. This was interesting and informative, but was not really the reason I started the book and was not what the dust jacket promised.But, despite the shortcomings or rather the under delivery, it still manages simultaneously to be a celebration of our existence, a warning about our imminent departure, a swan song for humanity, a warning for a world on the brink and also an evocative and imaginative pointer on our place in this world. And for that, this book is worth reading.If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.~ E. O. Wilson"
14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122194-glenn,4,"I came across this book on a jaunt around the web, and, I suspect like most people, thought “what an amazing idea!” The only question I had in hearing about it was whether the writing in the book would live up to its premise.It does, effortlessly. There is real, unforced poetry in Alan's writing, lines like “Rills lined with yellow asters flow soundlessly across spongy, hummocked meadows, so rain-logged that streams appear to float,” and, in a wonderful description of a famous mountain, he unfurls the lines “an hour southeast of Nairobi, Kilimanjaro appears, its shrinking snowcap dripping butterscotch under the rising sun.” These evocative, writerly lines contrast beautifully with the “just-the-facts, ma'am” approach of so much of the book--where Alan, having spoken with experts in various fields, lays out simply how events will transpire once we are gone, the full impact of what he lays out before us amplified by being presenting so cleanly, with such clarity.. And he does something remarkable in this book, considering the subject matter. He gives the reader a vivid sense of wonder at the doings of the natural world, a palpable sense of awe at how our little detour on the course of history will be covered and gone, no matter what we wreak upon the planet. Well, not entirely covered....Because there's also the horror at what we have done. At the poisons we have placed into the environment, seemingly forgetting that we are participants in the very environment we sicken, and at the short-sightedness of so much that goes into what we call “progress.” There are many moments in the book where a reader may need to close the cover, to gather themselves, in order to continue. For me, one of those moments was where the University of Plymouth marine biologist explained what he found while browsing in a pharmacy; for you there will surely be others. The fact is, there is much included in “The World Without Us” that goes far toward explaining how discussion provoked by this book will surely feel like it is concerning an eventuality not quite as far away as might feel comfortable. This book asks, over and over again, literally and philosophically, what will we leave behind? When it no longer matters what happens to us because of extinction, what will endure? Alan quotes Doug Irwin, who says “Humans are going extinct eventually…but life will continue…I figure it's interesting to be here now; I'm not going to get all upset about it.” And perhaps in Irwin's matter of fact acceptance of simply “being here now” lies some salvation. Perhaps we, as a species, could recognize our fleeting time on this earth, and cherish both that short time and the place, and each, in our own small way, make the place one worth living in, and our effect on it worth celebrating beyond our stay."
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"On the surface, this clever book describes what the world would be like if humans were to suddenly disappear from the face of the earth. Alan Weisman begins the book by describing the probable fate of man's buildings, structures--above and below ground, and cultural artifacts. For example, New York subways would completely flood within days. Interestingly, our longest-lasting legacy will probably be the radio signals transmitted into space.But the majority of this engaging book is really about ecology. The earth's natural ecology would heal much of the damage wrought by humans. Many species of plants and animals may increase in numbers, while some--like cockroaches and rats--will decrease. But certain types of damage will be difficult to heal; the oceanic spread of plastics will take geologic time scales to disperse. And the scariest of all is the nuclear by-products, some of which will stick around even over geologic time scales. "

Perhaps Kung Pao chicken, a spinach salad, blueberry pie, beer and peanuts, coffee and biscotti, shrimp etouffee. Very nice individually, some might be made even better with artful blending. Now toss them all in a big bowl and mix thoroughly. Appetizing?Weisman’s title teases us with a singular view of human existence. Like me, you may have heard fascinating highlights regarding how quickly New York’s transit system would be flooded, or what combination of factors would take down a highrise. Or perhaps that our pets would suffer very different fates: our pet dogs would all be killed by real predators, whereas housecats would be successful by staying in the trees and preying on birds.It is certainly true that almost every nugget here is intriguing—just as that goulash consists of individually tasty bits. But it doesn’t hold together, mostly because the author wasn’t able to firmly keep in mind what book he was writing.The best parts are those that follow the title, such as the tales urban decay. How nature has taken hold of the DMZ in Korea is good; even better was the unexpected equivalent in Cyprus, where the description of suddenly abandoned buildings is haunting.Some portions would better be described by the title The World We’ve Really Screwed Up. It is understandable, of course: while researching how things will be after we’re gone, the author must have done a great deal of research into how things got that way, and some of those stories are juicy. For example, Chernobyl’s history and the fate of the world’s other nuclear power plant is mostly treated as a tragedy waiting to happen. But at the same time, nature seems to be thriving amidst the radiation. While it is clear that we’ll leave behind plutonium wastes that will last forever, it isn’t at all clear to what extent nature would shrug this off as an irrelevancy.A notable problem the book fails to address is hinted at in the words of Doug Erwin, when Weisman looks back at the geological record. Displaying a chunk of limestone that shows evidence of prolific life on one side and nothing on the other, Erwin points to the faint white line of ash between them and explains that this is the P–T boundary, when the vast majority of the world’s species were snuffed out. Erwin shrugs and says “Life here was good. Life here got really bad. It then took a long time for life to get better.”Without us, the planet would revert to its timeless ways of spawning and destroying life. Without a sentient species to observe, the pace at which this happens becomes irrelevant. Without a sentient species to evaluate and judge, “biodiversity” and “beauty” become meaningless sounds.Weisman has a lot of great material here. With a different presentation, it might have been made into a better book. Or, better yet, as a continuing series of essays in a magazine such as Scientific American. But as a coherent book, it just doesn’t work.(Selected reading for Drinks and Dystopia (a post apocalyptic book club) for 6 December 2009.)­"

What would we humans leave behind us after we are gone? What would inhabitants of earth in 500 million years find to indicate that a sentient, technological species inhabited this planet? The answer, according to that book was that the main, and probably only long lasting, detectable impact that humans will have on earth, is the species that went extinct due to humans. This led to My second question at the time: Could it be possible that any of the previous large scale extinctions were due to a technological species that existed at the time. This book gave me an answer concerning the long term impact of humans on earth. While we are (fully justified) concerned about the impact we have on the planet, it's weather, life and environment, after we are gone, everything will be erased, and nature will repossess the planet. The weather, the atmosphere, the diversity of species and much more, will return to a new balance that will be very close to what it was before humans. We would be less than a blip on the geological radar that would be very hard to detect.What would happen to the Panama Canal if there were no humans to maintain it?What would happen to all the subway tunnels when there won't be any humans to constantly pump water out of them? What would happen to all our nuclear plants? Our toxic factories? Our cities? Our agricultural lands?What man made buildings and monuments would last longest?This was an interesting read, that on one hand emphasized all the damage we humans have done to the environment, and on the other hand, how quickly and with what power, nature will repossess areas where humans leave.

19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"This book has been on my wishlist for quite a while, so when I was able to get the audio edition, I didn't hesitate to dive right in. I will say that this is not the best audiobook I've ever heard. The reader, Adam Grupper, was a bit stiff at times, but that's really my only complaint. I think that this is one that I will have to read again myself at some point, because I feel like it's one that I would need to really take my time with, and absorb. This was so fascinating to me, and too often I would find myself getting caught up in imagining for myself what a scene of desolation or regrowth or whatever would look like, or pondering a point or thought, that I would miss some of what would come next and have to back up the audio and listen again. This book kind of had me all over the map emotionwise. I kind of already think that people are jerks, and this book did nothing to dispel that notion. In fact, it illustrated ways that we're jerks that I'd never even thought of before. Like the fact that we produce plastic exfoliants: miniscule little plastic particles in soaps or bodywashes that scrub us for about 2.3 seconds and then get whisked down the drain to eventually end up in the belly of a fish who mistook them for another fish's eggs. Plastic particles that don't break down for thousands of years... And that's just one example. Hunting is another. Now, I know all about hunting for food and population control. Food, fine, but I do have a problem with hunting for population control because we continue to encroach on land that was once the habitat of animals, and then when they have nowhere to go, when they are in our gardens trying to find food to survive, then there are too many, then they have to be thinned out. And hunting for sport or profit is a different matter entirely and honestly just makes me sick and angry and makes me want to hit things. OK people. It makes me want to hit people. With my car. Twice. ...Three times. Anyway. Parts of this book were just so mind-blowing to me that I feel ashamed of humanity. The Global Warming debate aside, we have done so much harm to this planet it's insane, and it will likely never be the same again. Maybe that's the way of things, I mean the Earth is continually evolving and changing, but somehow I just can't see the amount of radioactive waste that we will be leaving, stuff that will last for millions of years, as in any way good or normal. I just could not wrap my mind around the staggering time that some of these substances will be around. And Weisman usually talked in terms of the half-life of the substance, which is the period of time it takes for a substance undergoing decay to decrease by half. HALF. Millions and millions of years to decrease by HALF. And the average human lifespan is about 70 years. Just the thought of the ways that what we leave behind will affect whatever is left after we're gone is heartbreaking, and I'm immensely glad that I will not be around to see it. I sincerely hope that people read this book, and think about it. We have an obligation to future generations to leave them an inhabitable world, and we're going well out of our way to do just the opposite. I'm not a religious person. I don't know if there is anything out there, but I can't help but wonder if any god could possibly forgive causing such lasting damage to the planet and everything that shares it with us... "

Imagine if Thanos snapped all humankind out of existence. What happens to our cities and buildings? What of the plastic we've released into the ocean (which takes 10 000 years to decompose in the presence of oxygen, but would take 100 000 years to break on the oxygen-deprived ocean floor)? What of the oil refineries, the nuclear reactors, the radioactive dump sites? (Spoilers: without human maintenance, they're all going to explode and release their particles into the air, causing massive death everywhere). What of the pesticides and fertilizers we've released into the soil, which impede wild plant species from surviving? What of large man-created structures (dynamited diamond mines, Panama channel, Eurotunnel)? What of the invasive species of plants and animals we've introduced on continents where they didn't originally belong? What of critically endangered species? What of the billions of birds which die yearly on impact with human-created structures while flying? What of the few coral reefs remaining? What of another dominant species rising after our extinction?There were times while reading this book when I almost wished humans disappeared. The author presented places such as the abandoned resort Varosha on Cyprus, the unoccupied militarized strip of land between North and South Korea and the restricted radioactive site of Cernobîl. Nature eventually reconquered these places (albeit animals at Cernobîl have a much shorter lifespan and reproduce much faster). The vision of New York without humans seems straight out of a beautiful post-apocalyptic future. There are plenty of parallels drawn with past human civilizations (like the Mayans who perished because of their own greed) or human tribes who invaded new lands and eliminated all megafauna. There are parallels drawn between the Anthropocene extinction and the biggest extinction ever - the Permian one, 252 million years ago - where 95% of species disappeared. This book is a call to arms. This book is a dystopian thriller. This book is a speculative science-fiction piece. But most importantly, this book is reality. It's our immediate future. It was published in 2007, 12 years ago, so a lot of the info inside has gone worse. There were only 6.5 billion people back when this book was published. Now we're nearing 7.5 billion. There was 10 times more plastic than plankton back then (how much is now? The book tells how lots of hygiene products for exfoliating have micro-polymers in them, which are eaten by plankton and eventually end up in the entire food chain.) Puffins were found with 44 plastic pieces on average inside their stomach. How are we going to solve this?The world without us will stay with me for a long, long time. I'm going to recommend it left and right. It's a good read for architects. It's a good read for geologists. It's a good read for nature lovers. But ultimately, it's a good read for every human being living on this planet. We only have one Earth, so we should be aware of our impact."

22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book tries to imagine what the world would be like if we were just raptured away or abducted by aliens, with little or no warning. Despite being ostensibly a book about the world without us, it turns out to mostly be a book about us. Or, more accurately, what we’ve done to the world, which the world will have to cope with whether we’re here and part of that or not. If you’re science-aware, there’s probably not much to learn — in fact, if you’re up on your climate science, what’s here is very basic when it comes to that. It does muse interestingly on certain specific animals and habitats which would benefit from a world without humans. There’s some good stuff on places where humans don’t go, which are proving to be wildlife sanctuaries even when they’re utterly radioactive.But mostly, I think I hoped for a bit more of the future, and a bit less of the past and present. Of course, the past can tell us what some environments used to be like without human intervention, or after specific types of human intervention. And of course, the present shapes what will come. And we can’t really predict evolution — look at the differences between the stuff in the Burgess shale and later forms, for example. Or even the way that mammals succeeded the dinosaurs. But I still hoped for a bit more about the future, what kinds of animals might thrive, what it might look like.If you’re already depressed by what humans have been up to, this will make you feel worse.

Its not depressing in the way a sad novel is, but its upsetting in the way it really drives home how much humans have fucked the world up. The sacry thing about the book is that when reading about how humans have dissappeared and nature reclaims her property, I'm not thinking 'how terrible', I'm thinking 'how wonderful'. I've pulled back from the brink of thinking of humans as a disease and better off not existing - we are, after all, probably still the most imaginative and alive organisms on this planet', and so much that is beautiful would not exist or be thought of as beautiful without us - but still, if there is a way to eliminate a large proportion of humans in an ethical, painless manner (which will never happen), I'd vote for it. About the book itself: its extremely well researched. Weisman delves into many scientific areas and talks to extremely interesting and truly specialized people to explore questions ranging from: what happens to major cities like New York, to what happens to wildlife like birds or farm animals, what happens to nuclear plants and waste, what happens to our artifacts, like art, plastics, heavy metals, piping systems, bridges, petrochemical plants, etc, etc.The scariest fact: did you know that the wind and waves erode plastic like it does rocks, ie, into little bits of silicon or plastic sand? As the bits get smaller and smaller, they get ingested by smaller and smaller organisms. Birds were found dead with enough plastic accumulated in their intestines that equates to several pounds if in a human being. Staggeringly, there is six times more plastic in the oceans, by weight, than plankton."

“Humans perpetrated the extinctions that killed off three-fourths of America’s late Pleistocene megafauna, a menagerie far richer than Africa’s today.” 
 Humans, even allegedly environmentally harmonic native humans, are a plague on the world. The world without us will recover the eden it once was in as quickly as two hundred years. But... it will have to adapt to our long lasting mistakes. Plastic. Nuclear waste. CFCs.There was beautiful adventurous imagery and true horror. And stubborn hope:“Since the 1990s, the Netherlands has not only offered incentives that practically equate organic farming with patriotism, but has also struggled to convince its EU partners that everything applied to the land ends up in the sea anyway.”Weisman’s 2005 article Earth Without People, and this book, were likely the inspiration for Life After People, the two-hour special documentary that had an audience of 5.4 million viewers and was the most watched program ever on the History Channel.Life After People: https://youtu.be/GyEUyqfrScU"

By the time people recognize crisis, it may be too late. This guy is an excellent writer. He makes complicated things enjoyable to read about, without dumbing it down at all.

But then I listened to the first chapter and I immediately thought this is the book I need to own, in paper. I seldom if ever have that reaction to a book anymore, which should tell you just how highly I esteemed it. This is a mesmerizing image of the world without us and all we do to sometimes sustain it but mostly maim it. Fictional apocalypses are usually fun, but this nonfictional post apocalyptic world is genuinely haunting in all its meticulous rendering. There are ordinary everyday things you’ll never look at the same way twice after this book, it shifts an entire way of thinking to know this impending transience of all things. The way nature would move in to repossess its own, the way the world would continue unobserved and uncaring, finally freed. Really fascinating reading and so very informative. I’ve learned tons of new facts. It’s the best sort of educational material, the kind that’s accessibly written (yes, miraculously enough even chemistry) and entertainingly presented. In his extensive 25 minutes long afterword of thank yous the author explains how the book came to be and talks about traveling extensively for these stories and it shows, every location is presented with such vividness, it’s a travelogue with a mission, its message…somber and sobering, yet strangely not at all depressing. The world without us…scarcely imaginable to mankind’s solipsism…is to go on. It’s done it before and it’ll do it again, until the sun burns out. Terrific book, one of the best ones I’ve read recently, significant, intelligent, important. The sort of book that should be taught in schools or at least be on the list for every enthusiastic autodidact. This one receives the highest recommendation for everyone. A book I plan to revisit, uncharacteristically enough. The audio version is nicely read too, very dynamic indeed. Although this seems like the sort of book that ought to be read, more so than listened to. At least for how my brain absorbs and processes information."
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1393336-jennifer-aka-em,4,"An astonishing book, and the first piece of non-fiction that I've read in quite some time that has had the emotional power of a novel. The first comment I'll make has to do with that: Weisman's voice is a powerful one. He knows how to marshall the facts but also how to keep the story moving, and most importantly, get the reader engaged at an emotional as well as intellectual level. Weisman's research seemed incredibly solid, but the book never felt plodding or laden down with eye-glazing data, as is so often the case with environmental treatises where the (defensive) author feels compelled to justify his or her conclusions against the nay-sayers with endless reams of facts and figures. Instead, Weisman uses the device of the ""thought experiment"": what would happen to the planet if humans *poof* simply disappeared. How long would it take to revert to a natural state, recovering from the damage we've done to our home planet? What would live, what would die, and would we be ""remembered""?The enormity of the problem--climate change and global warming, deforestation and species extinction, the unsolved issues of nuclear waste, carbon emissions and ozone depletion--can so easily overwhelm us. Weisman tells the story by jumping from topic to topic; era to era; location to location. Since we’re often dealing in geologic time, it could have been disorienting. Instead, it forces the reader to seek patterns in trends and events across time and invest them with meaning that might not occur if she was led down a straight, chronological path. There is much that is new to learn, and even what we already know (or think we know) is shown in a new light.In short, it was a very, very effective way to let the complexities of the problem reveal themselves through the various scenarios, all well-documented, presented. Weisman leads us where he wants us to go: not merely to an acknowledgement that environmental destruction is occurring by our own hands, but to a renewed sense of commitment to what might be done to stop it.If I have any trouble with the book, it is: a) in the premise that sets it up; and b) in the final conclusion. Weisman overtly says that the premise is not to speculate on what ends humanity, only that it ends quickly and completely–-all at once, everywhere. Unfortunately, I couldn't get my head round the fact that it won't actually happen that way, will it? Even a massive asteroid hit, a broadscale nuclear war, biological warfare or the outbreak of a world-wide plague will have human life petering out slowly, unevenly, inconsistently. There will be no quiet overtaking of our cities by kudzu, birch and aspen. Instead, as human beings slowly and agonizingly die off, those small bands of survivors who’re left will not go gently into that good night. As resources dwindle, as infrastructure fails, as hope fades...human nature and, never mind that, our basic will to survive, will remain intact and grow ever more desperate. The will to survive is an individual, not collective, one. People will fight for the basic necessities of life: food, water, shelter. Civilization, government, order and what we construe as morality and humanity will cease to exist to any meaningful degree.It won’t be pretty.Perhaps I am a pessimist about human nature, informed by my study of social psychology, and more recently, my reading of The Road and Blindness, which foretell gruesome, cruel and barbaric acts perpetrated by humans on humans in the face of just such doomsday scenarios. There has never been a situation where–especially in the face of annihilation–those with power and resources have not wielded them to their own advantage, to the extent of overtaking and enslaving those without.So, I struggled with the premise, and before humans are wiped from the face of the earth, I wonder how much more damage we will do, not just to each other but to our home planet. And if preventing more damage requires universal cooperation, as it surely does, I despair that we have the individual or collective will to achieve it.The conclusion and suggestion Weisman leaves us with, that we should limit reproduction to one child per woman, is laughably simplistic not to mention politically impractical. It's not that I was looking for an ""answer"" from the book, but far better to leave the questions it raises unanswered, I think, than to undermine the careful and detailed picture drawn of the problem by offering a poorly conceived solution. Better instead to send people off, galvanized into action and inspired by hope in what might be possible, to seek those solutions. Which (in my more optimistic hours), is exactly what I think this book can do and likely has done. "

After hearing the interview, I HAD TO go out that afternoon and buy the book. I've never had a work of non-fiction activate my imagination in so many ways: dense Hansel & Gretel forests, roaming megafauna, organisms that learned to digest organic matter over time, lost cities, underground caverns ... I absolutely love this book because it's so much more than post-apocalyptic speculation. There are so many things in the book that I'm learning that I didn't know before. For example, I didn't know that Thomas Jefferson and his deist gang didn't believe that animals could be extinct because they were a part of god's creation. I also didn't know that charcoal was formed from trees fallen back before the organisms responsible for the decomposition we know today developed the ability to digest them. Too, I had no idea that some seeds can lie dormant for 1000 years waiting for the right conditions to grow (such as fire). And I didn't know that the reason for the Great Plains in the U.S. was the burning done by native Americans years ago mainly for hunting purposes. I never knew of the 4% of once-occupied beach front Cyprus that has been cordoned off as a no man's land since 1972. I'd never heard of the underground network of rooms in Cappadocia, Turkey, capable of hiding and housing 30,000 in the case of attack. And I didn't know that there are so few untouched and nationally protected areas of forest left in the world. I guess there's a lot out there to learn. Maybe I should read non-fiction more often. This book is leaving me with so many tangents in my brain that I should probably go raid the county library sometime soon."

This question sent Weisman on a journey that resulted in this book where he tries to answer this question. It is an interesting journey where the reader gets a chapter on what would happen if every nuclear power plant would no longer be under human control, what would happen to cities, what would happen to farm animals, what would happen to agricultural land, and so on. In each case he tries to find people that have knowledge about the subject, or places where people have left, and therefore can show us what happens. He basically manages to do two things. He shows the reader how quickly places have gone wild after people are no longer there to keep it human centred. And he also manages to show the reader just how bad this human centred world is really for most of the life on this planet. We, mankind, have a huge impact on this planet, and unfortunately that impact isn't all good. This book doesn't even centre on climate change. It's part of it, but mostly it is about the pollution we are inflicting on the Earth, and the way we keep expanding our territory, and pushing everything, and everyone else to the sides. He manages to bring up a lot of interesting avenues in this that I hadn't thought about. To be quite honest, it is in parts a really depressing read, but I like to understand how the world works, and therefore it is also an interesting read.The thing is, Weisman doesn't quite manage to show us how the world would be without us. He explains how different things, (animals, plants, technology and so on) would work if mankind would all of a sudden disappear, but nature works as a whole. So it is up to the reader to try to make sense of the somewhat contradicting conclusion in different chapters. For example, the nuclear chapter paints a rather bleak picture of what would happen if all the 400 plus nuclear power plants would all of a sudden have no human controllers, while the chapter on abandoned cities shows a different picture, shall we say idyllic picture, of what would happen. In a why I understand why Weisman sets up his story in this way, and perhaps it would have been too complicated to show how all these things would work together because there are so many different aspects to this story. And perhaps nobody even knows how to combine all of this into a coherent story. But even though he doesn't try to bring all this together into one coherent answer to the question he began with, I still found this an very interesting and compelling book."

Weisman dispels people from the earth and asks what things would be like without us. How long would our buildings remain? The chemicals we left in the water? The other species that we’ve controlled?But if you live in a country with internet access to read this review, then you probably know the answers. We’ve hurt things but the world would still go on and most of the stuff we’ve made would fall apart a little while later. We’re doing amazing harm to the environment and yet we’re pretty erasable. When you realize the premise is an excuse to complain about the present state of the world, the book loses some of its charm. Despite the title, the premise and the opening of the book, a striking amount of it is not about what would happen to the world if humans died off or disappeared. Most of the first hundred pages are either speculation about where we came from or complaints against humans. We’ve mistreated each other, our expansion hurt local wildlife, our zoos hinder their life patterns and our attempts at conservation stifle nature. Misanthropy is thick throughout: it’s clear Weisman wrote it out of an extremist ecologist’s disdain for how we’ve behaved to each other and the rest of nature.In this zeal he commits a popular fallacy exposed in lines like, “In the absence of humans, it filled with animals.” Humans are animals, but Weisman is absorbed in the fallacy that we’re different and divided from the rest of nature. We’re often a destructive part warranting his displeasure, but we are not in any way above or outside of nature. Sometimes we even try to fix what we do wrong. He plays just close enough to his “world without us” gimmick that that he can sniff at existing solutions like conservationism while providing no new answers of his own because, remember, the book’s about us all dying. But his best offerings are an overview of a group for voluntary human extinction and a global one-child policy, the former not directly endorsed, and the latter both grossly unpragmatic and a measure that would not reverse most of the longterm damage Weisman describes. It winds up feeling like he's not only lecturing, but cheating. That is particularly disappointing after seeing him do a talk, where he was much more open-minded and gracious.The book seems the result of two strong possibilities. One is that Weisman, who had published three books before and had industry contacts, pitched a neat idea, got to writing and found he didn’t have the material for a compelling full book, and so fluffed it out with environmentalism. Plenty of shocking pop-science books do this.The other possibility is the suspicion that we’ve been hoodwinked, given a shocking premise to draw us in only so he can evangelize at us. We’re unhappy when real evangelists do this and should be no more tolerant of Weisman, even if we are on his pro-environmental side. It’s cloying because we should be on his side. His concerns about oil, plastics and radiation are valid. By trumpeting his cause while hiding from difficult decisions behind his book's gimmick, he misses the mark.I’ve read national reviews claiming this book would change the world if everybody read it. I think the world would do better by starting with Douglas Adams’s Last Chance to See or Al Gore’s The Assault on Reason. Both of those are far more levelheaded approaches to environmental thought, with considerably greater compassion for their fellow humans, and in Gore’s case, considerably greater insight into why people mess things up so badly."

The book covers many topics, some more elaborated than others. It's harrowing to read how we humans kill coral reefs, acidify oceans, damage ozone layers, carry out excessive killing of wildlife (plants and animals) and destroy their habitats. Not even our beloved pet cats are innocent. It is a relief to know where humans retreat, wildlives return, such as the DMZ between North Korean and South Korean. Here is a link of the wildlife in Chernobyl 30 years after the disaster.""Burned insolation and charred wood add nutrient to Manhattan's growing soil cap. Native Virginia creeper and poison ivy claw at walls covered with lichens, which thrive in the absence of air pollution. Red-tailed hsawk and peregrine falcons nest in the increasingly skeletal high-rise structures. Within two centuries, estimates Brooklyn Botanic Garden Vice President Steven Clemants, colonizing trees will have substantially replaced pioneer weeds. Gutters buried under tons of leave litters provide new fertile ground for new native oaks and maples from city parks. Arriving black locust and autumn olive shrubs fix nitrogen, allowing sunflowers, bluestems and white snakeroots to move in, along with apple trees--their seeds expelled by proliferating birds. Biodiversity will increase even more...as buildings tumble and smash into each other, and lime from crushed concrete raise soil PH, inviting in trees, such as buckthorn and birch that need less acidic environment.""Coincidentally, I find an artist impression of the New York without us, which echos the author's vision described above--a dystopian for us, a welcoming change for other species in the world.The author's argument against GMO (especially Monsanto) is from ecology instead of human health point of view. I find it worth noting, but due to the format of the book (too many topics, too little space for each one), it lacks the depth required for such as a complex issue.The author's message is clear: we humans must stop being the cancer of the planet before it's too late."

35,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,3,"When your species is 7.5 billion strong on this planet and still counting you may permit yourselves a few moments and think ’We are THE real deal, aren’t we ?’ The fact that there are more number of microbes living inside a single human being than the overall human population is again beside the point here. Alan Weisman wants us to go a few steps further and imagine what would happen if we were to vanish from the earth suddenly and inexplicably. The premise and the ‘what-if’ scenario is extremely amusing to ponder over but I have my reservations on the execution of it all.What it sets out to beFor a species whose entire lifetime does not span even a blink for the planet’s timelines, mankind has reshaped the earth in unimaginable ways. Wiping out this invasive and disruptive organism would bring out immense changes all over the place. With the disappearance of human presence the time taken for flora and fauna to reclaim the land would be minimal. A few centuries down the line the planet would be an unrecognizable place and yet if you have in mind a lush, green Eden then think again ! There are enough indestructible plastic detritus, nuclear material, pesticides and CFC to damn all things living for ages to come. Also with our proliferation as a species, there are many organisms that have disappeared and most of them if not all of them are not coming back again. A world without humans from a natural standpoint will be a different one from what we leave behind. It is true that there will be the return of nature post the exit of man but it would an unrecognizable world for any stray human being that stays behind. There are conversations with multiple experts – ecologists, biologists, nuclear scientists, engineers in the book all of whom agree to the fact that nature and its denizens might not notice our disappearance as much as we hope they would. Barring the animals, plants and microbes dependent on humans for their daily life there wouldn’t be many who will mourn the passing of the lords of the earth. Borrowing from that favourite sci-fi cliché, an alien arriving on earth might need to spend some serious time unravelling the exploits of homo sapiens.What it ends up beingOne of the downsides of getting old is that we look down on younger generations (I think there was mention of this elsewhere in my reviews too). This is forever punctuated by the phrase ’In our times’ which is leaning too much on the past with a blind eye turned towards the future. The book suffers a similar fate that it dwells on the past in fantastic passages meant to evoke the lushness of earth but at places it paints itself to a corner. It is true that disasters like Chernobyl happened and we scarred the land for a long time into the future and yet while the present offers bleak hopes, Weisman does not dwell for long on the future. Considering that the scope of his book is almost completely futuristic, I found this to be a serious shortcoming. The past was wondrous, the present is grim but the future ? Weisman offers half-hearted attempts at answering this scenario and that is where the execution lags. Another nagging point is that Weisman does not really explain how we would disappear. Would it be pestilence, drought or war that would finally get our goose ? Each of these might have their own impact on the biosphere and an examination of the fallout of these might have made a lot more value add to the whole set of scenarios. Also, at a time when 2016 has been titled as the hottest year in recorded history it is rather farfetched to imagine the earth as a green paradise in the future.What it might have beenIn the broader scheme of things human beings are immaterial to this planet. There is only the here and now and all of our so called pretences are futile in the long run. I would have adored this book if Weisman began with an extrapolation of the points he understands from the experts and recreated a vision of the world a few centuries from now. With this vision, he could have then worked his way backwards on how it would all come into being. His descriptions of the Puszcza Białowieska in Poland gave me ample hope that he would have been able to conjure a fantastic vision of a future sans human beings.Well written and yet poorly executed."

I started reading it and then had to give it back to the library before I was done and then I had to get it back to read the last chapter. At the risk of being platitudinous, this book is no fine wine.The literary world is definitely instep with our current go-green zeitgeist and, as past president of Earlham's Environmental Action Committee and as someone whose economic footprint is minimal, I am quite pleased. That being said, there are a handful of books in the green vein with which I actually can interface with pleasure--the best among them being Jared Diamond's wonderful novel, ""Collapse"".Weisman has done what so many before him have done: He went out into the field and gathered opinions from experts instead of overtly forming an opinion himself. Then the challenge is to present these findings and conversations in a manner that engages and interacts with the reader. Instead, I felt like I was constantly sifting through Weisman's raw data. Occasionally he gives us a few choice phrases or descriptions, but mostly he just plods along--recounting. I wish this book were so much more than it was. The rub is that I can't think of any specific examples to buttress my statements. "
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369955-p,2,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Not only was it given to me by my new uncle, but it ostensibly dealt with a subject that I have spent some time thinking about (usually during periods of outdoor solitude such as when walking to or from work) -- the decay of human structures and how they might be co-opted by nature if they were abandoned. Unfortunately, rather than dealing primarily with scientific, archaeological or anthropological observations about the resilience of human architectural methods and materials or the observed condition of previously abandoned human settlements over time, this book ends up being primarily a pantheistic paean to Mother Gaia as an unchanging deity somehow compromised by a parasitic humanity upon her. As a religious or philosophical text, I suppose it is timely, as it does document with some clarity the belief system that is common among a certain social strata in the present day. Of course, I would suggest that a critical reading of this book would illuminate some of the holes in post modern anti-human environmentalism, so it may be a useful work in that regard.  "

We have the knowledge to be MUCH better caretakers of this spaceship Earth, but we aren't. Why is that? Oh and in case you're wondering: all that will be left of us after a relatively short geological time, is on a few rather small probes we sent into space in the 1970s. This is a very difficult book to review. You would think Alan Weisman was going to tell us what would happen, if the all-wise-creator-of-everything snapped his/her/it's fingers (or whatever) and made us disappear. How would Earth cope? Very nicely as it turns out. But no - that's not what this book is about. It's about the huge mess we've made of things ever since some Neanderthal picked up a bone and donged his neighbour on the head with it. In great, detailed, depressingness (my new word), he describes the evil evolution of plastic and how we've stuffed up (literally) our beautiful oceans with it. He describes how we've messed up the atmosphere; how we've hidden toxic nuclear waste in underground salt domes, which is just like sweeping the dust under the rug; how we've wiped out a mind-boggling number of animal and plant species - never to return. It's just so depressing! And there is no light at the end of the tunnel. In fact, if there was a light, it's probably from the nuclear waste we tossed around willy nilly.Yes, he does tell us what happens to all those lovely bridges we built (they fall down sooner than you'd think) and those ugly sky scrapers (they fall down even faster than the bridges). That was all very interesting, but I just couldn't get past the descriptions of the messes we've made. I really think we're past the point of no return with Mother Earth. Global warming will claim us all. And to underline this, I'm writing this while seemingly half my country (Australia) is being ravaged by wildfires. Entire communities wiped out, many people dead, hundreds of homes gone, millions of innocent animals dead (in the most cruel way).

40,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/958786-james,4,"This is a good book.Not a great book, but a good book.As a humbling, interesting book about Our World and the incompatibility of our Current Society with Ecology, it belongs on your shelf next to Guns, Germs, and Steel, An Inconvenient Truth, and The Omnivore’s Dilemma. And there is plenty to keep your eyes wide open in horror at our existence’s lack of harmony with the environment. Like the frightening petrochemical monstrosity that is Houston, Texas. Yeehaw!!!This is a subversive book in that its thesis is simple, but in that innocent idea to hypothesize what the world would be without human life, Weisman has an intriguing frame for which to explore and assess the magnitude of human’s impact on the planet – an extensive, pervasive presence. Unfortunately, Our Legacy is most likely doomed to be chemicals, metals, genetic tinkering, ecosystem manipulation, farms, cities, industry, nuclear waste, mining, pollution, etc, et al. Interestingly enough, it is the bronze and copper sculptures as well as the radio waves of information that we have beamed into space that will probably be the longest-lasting remnant of our flawed existence.It is oddly comforting to know that in our absence nature will quickly reclaim our cities, farms, and homes. It is equally alarming to know how much of our byproducts will continue to plague the planet long after our departure.Weisman is at his worst when he lingers too long describing what would happen to the Panama Canal in our absence (Surprise, it’d stop working, like a lot of things…). He is at his best describing the beautifully, tragically ironic reclamation of the Korean DMZ by endangered fauna.This book is frustrating when you realize that the only decent thing to do for The Cause would be to go away. It’s not a cause without supporters. The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement and the Church of Euthanasia both have their points. Even our current mode of departure with the expensive mortuary industry leading the way with exotically unnecessary coffins is rife with negative impact on the planet. But don’t bother getting too riled up about environmental destruction because Weisman makes a compelling case for our Doom to be wrought instead by New Technologies.The creepiest, eeriest, scariest, most resounding part of the book comes when our modern civilization and the pompousness of our overindulged lifestyles is compared to the fall of the Mayan Empire: “Society had evolved too many elites, all demanding exotic baubles…a culture wobbling under the weight of an excess of nobles, all needing quetzal feathers, jade, obsidian, fine chert, custom polychrome, fancy corbelled roofs, and animal furs. Nobility is expensive, nonproductive, and parasitic, siphoning away too much of society’s energy to satisfy its frivolous cravings. Too many heirs wanted thrones, or needed some ritual bloodletting to confirm their stature. So dynastic warfare heightened. As more temples need building, the higher caloric demand on workers requires more food production…Population rises to insure enough food-producers. War itself often increases population – as it did in the Aztec, Incan, and Chinese empires – because rulers require cannon fodder. Stakes rise, trade is disrupted, and population concentrates…There is dwindling investment in long-term crops that maintain diversity. Refugees living behind defensive walls farm only adjacent areas, inviting ecological disaster. Their confidence in leaders who once seemed all knowing, but are obsessed with selfish, short-term goals, declines with the quality of life. People lose faith. Ritual activity ceases. They abandon centers.”Sound familiar?Not one to be entirely negative and without Hope, god bless him, Weisman offers compelling data in support of population control and concludes his acknowledgments with, “Without us, Earth will abide and endure; without her, however, we could not even be.”"
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3057525-sadie,3,"One thing you need to know: This is not a book on what to do to make the current world a better place. It's rather a book that shows why the world might be a better place (in most cases) if humanity simply disappeared. And it's not just a philosophical essay on what a world without humans would be like. It's a science-based, fact driven volume looking at many examples on what might happen in a world without humans. Like, what would happen to nuclear power plants without anybody supervising them? Would there be a meltdown any time soon or would they just... shut down? What about farm animals who need humans - will they have any chance to survive? Will cats, who know how to hunt for feeding or pure pleasure, be the only pet to make it? Think about all those cities with huge subway systems underneath them - systems that need pumps to keep the incoming water at bay - how long will these tunnels stay water free if nobody's operating the pumps? When would New York collaps into its tunnel system? And my, I haven't even touched polymers. See what I'm getting at? A world without humans isn't just a place where nature sighs a HUGE breathe of relief. What we would leave behind was a world that's dependend on human action on so many levels, it's scary.So yes, the topic and main theories of this book are well worth a closer look. Yet I'm quite torn on how to rate this. On the one hand, there are many, many super interesting chapters and thoughts in here. I love every bit and piece about ghost towns for example, abandonded places always give me a special ""good kind of creepy"" feeling, I can't explain it any better, so the chapter on that city in Cyprus was a winner for me. Also, every kind of explanation of what would happened to structures (in terms of buildings and cities) built by humans was fascinating, as was everything connected to flora and fauna - and population in general. However, the science/chemical parts were a tad much for me. I have a general interest in these topics, but Weisman was testing my limits here. Plus, my choice of edition hasn't helped: Reading via kindle and the chance to check certain scientific terms with the dictionary onboard might've been the better way for me. It's not that Weismann uses too extravagant terminology, but some of the chemical stuff showed me that while my understanding of the English language is very solid, my general comprehension of science is not. But that was my fault, not the book's."
42,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"I really liked this book. It tells a fascinating story about humanity's impact on the world and just how much of an impression we will leave behind. My interest in the book partially stems from my interest in how systems (ideas, people's technologies, etc.) work and what can cause them to fail. I was fascinated to learn that NYC relies on a large of amount of water pumps to keep its tunnels dry and usable. So much of what we take for granted in our world is due to the continued maintenance of our systems, systems that would vanish quite quickly. He uses very interesting contemporary and historic events to illustrate his points and really drive home just how transitory a lot of our edifices and symbols are.I suppose what I most took away from the book was that we should should not take our place on the planet for granted. We are not guarunteed that there will be a posterity to remember our great deeds and achievements unless we build a better tomorrow today. The universe is a harsh place and the sum of human achievement could be lost if we do not work to maintain it.Long story short: neat idea, good illustrative examples, and a message that demands pondering makes this a very good read.On a side note I noticed an error in the book edition I had and contacted the publishers about that. A few days later I actually got an e-mail from Weisman thanking me for pointing our the error for him. Pretty cool!"

I read this for my environmental book group, and probably would not have picked up such a depressing book on my own. The basic idea is kind of interesting -- how would nature respond if people suddenly disappeared from the earth? Would the damage we caused to the environment be corrected? It's kind of a novel concept and would be good as an article (which it originally was), but it certainly didn't need to become a full-length book. After about the first 10 pages, I got the point. Without people, animals would flourish, plants would bloom, buildings would crumble, etc. I didn't need 150+ more pages of this (incidentally I only got through the first couple of chapters). In any case, my main problem with this book is that it really doesn't tell us anything about what we can actually do to improve the environment short of getting rid of all people, which the author himself doesn't advocate. I definitely found this book extremely disappointing."

49,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"Death is a bummer. I mean, here's the thing - we all know we're going to die. It's part of the human condition, knowing that sooner or later the only existence that we've ever known is going to come to an end. And that'll be it - no more us. It's a creepy thought, to be honest, which is why most of us do our everlovin' best to ignore it. We all know that we're going to die, but we don't want to know it, so we ignore it. We eat our Super-Double-CheezyFries, go BASE jumping, vote Republican, willfully ignoring the inevitable truth that these things are going to end up killing us.Even when we are confronted with our mortality, we still find ways to console ourselves. We look around at our families and our friends and say things like, ""No one truly dies so long as they're remembered."" And we accept that even if we aren't there, other people are. The things we've done in our lives, no matter how tiny, will echo around humanity as long as it lasts. If we are truly lucky, we will have contributed greatly to our species as a whole and gained a very special place in history.But then we remember that even history is impermanent. The average species only gets to live about four million years, and we've already eaten up about a quarter of that. What's more, we seem to be doing our level best to come in below average. Science tells us one inescapable fact: nothing lasts forever. One day, maybe sooner, maybe later, the last of the humans will die. Perhaps we'll be replaced by another intelligence, one that can continue our work. Or perhaps we'll just leave everything behind. All that will be left will be artifacts, objects that tell the story of humanity.And that cheers you up a bit. We're good at leaving marks, after all. We built a wall that's so big it's practically landscape. We split two continents apart in the name of commerce. We have girded our land masses in iron and asphalt, erected great cities of glass, concrete and steel. We have lowered mountains and raised seas, extracted the blood of the earth and bent the rivers to our will. Even if the human race vanished tomorrow, some far-future alien archaeologist would still be able to come here and know that a brilliant and puissant species once walked this world.Yeah. About that....This book was inspired by a very simple question: what would happen if all the humans just... disappeared? How it happened doesn't really matter. Maybe aliens, maybe Jesus, perhaps some strange, species-specific quantum Critical Existence Failure. Whatever the cause, the sun rises in the morning and humans just aren't there anymore. How would the world handle our disappearance? Would it even notice? What has humanity wrought that would last?It's a simple question with an incredibly complex answer. In order to even begin to know what would happen upon our disappearance, we need to know how the world works. We need to look at the forces that drive evolution and species propagation. What is it that allows life to spread and to flourish, to adapt to changing circumstances and make the best of a hard situation? What do we know from our studies of the unimaginably distant past that will help us foretell the future?In addition, we need to know what effect humans have already had on the world. We've all heard the horror stories about the species driven to extinction by carelessness or ignorance - the passenger pigeon, the moa, the dodo - but our effect has been so much greater. Weisman is willing to categorize humanity as a force of nature thanks to the effect that we've had. Our relentless conquest of the Earth has, in small ways and large, unavoidably set evolution on a path that would have been very different had we never arisen in the first place. In a way, our influence can never be truly erased, and will likely survive for as long as biology does.Finally, we need to know about the things we're leaving behind. What is our world made of, and how well would it survive the rigors of time? The oceans of concrete that we've poured will freeze and thaw over and over again, and, aided by the surprising power of flowers and grass, will split, crack and crumble in time. Our massive steel skyscrapers will be undone by water and creeping vegetation. Our stonework will be worn down by wind and water, our satellites will fall, dams will burst and the wilderness will relentlessly take over the sacred places of the world. In the end, the only testament to our existence will be a handful of bronze statues and gold ornaments, and the impassive visages of the faces on Mt. Rushmore. And even they will one day fall.If you're one of those people who worries about the impact that humanity has had on the earth, this will be a heartening book. As the geologic record shows, there's pretty much nothing the universe can throw at this planet that can kill it. At least not so far. And the impact that humans are having isn't anywhere near the great extinctions of the past, in which great swaths of death cut through the biosphere in a matter of decades. Understand this: there is nothing that we can do to the earth that the earth cannot undo, given time. And that is a comforting thought. We do sometimes get wrapped up in our own awesomeness and assume that our actions have infinite consequences when, in fact, they don't. We beat our breasts about the ozone hole and the amazon, the Northwest African Cheetah and the Sharp Snouted Day Frog. We read about garbage gyres in the sea, and irradiated wastes on the land and despair over what we have done to this world. The truth is that the world will move on after humans, and the future will hardly know that we were here.That's where the book got depressing for me, though. You see, I can take or leave individuals. I think The People are, in general, dumber than a Texas schoolbook. But all in all, I like Humanity. In the two hundred thousand years or so that Homo sapiens has been wandering this world, we've done some really neat things. We've built globe-spanning civilizations, produced unparalleled art, music and architecture, and invented worlds of brilliant fiction. We've examined the universe at its largest and peered back in time to the moment it began. We have gazed into the heart of the atom to know how reality works at its smallest levels. We've danced and sang and lived. And even with the terrible things that we've done, both to each other and to our world, I still think we're a species worth knowing. We're a species that deserves better than oblivion.But the universe doesn't care about what we deserve.So if you take anything away from the book, let it be this - our existence here as a species is temporary. There's no reward for our goodness, nor punishment for our sins. But here and now, we are alive, and capable of amazing things. It is up to us to decide what those things will be, and how to spend the time remaining to us.Let's make it wondrous.----------------------------------------------------------""Below the surface, the oxidizing metal parts of chemical alley will provide a place for Galveston oysters to attach.

Alan Weisman investigates this from many different angles, from homes and cities, pets, the subways and skyscrapers of New York City, to nuclear power plants, Białowieza Puszcza, the DMZ, plants, coral reefs and the oceans, the Suez Canal, birds and many other types of wildlife, etc. I learned a lot about science, history, and natural history in this book and got a lot out of it. Now, if only each woman in the world would have only the one child, as Weisman poses as a solution to the problems we're facing, the world be a better place. "
51,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"The book covers the changes us humans brought on the world and our relation to our environment from a very fertile point of view. By imagining that we disappear and that all our activities cease suddenly, the author reviews our impact on the ecosystem. The world, in this book, is the biomass and the conditions which favour the existence of life.Weisman goes through a pretty big list of changes wrought in the world by our actions, like deforestation, urbanisation, industrialisation, nuclear pollution, desertification and climate change, and what the rest of the world is going to do with them after we're gone. He explains how cities, industrial complexes, farmlands and different ecosystems will change in various time-frames so that they will reach new equilibria. (the word 'equilibrium' here is pretty misleading because the planet's ecosystem is always changing, so it can always jump from one partial equilibrium to another)The book is an impressive work of imagination and investigation. Weisman is helped by different experts in their respective fields to describe the world after humans are gone. He adopts a tone of wonder throughout the book, marvelling at nature's power and our excesses, without condemning any practice outright. He also notes a certain maturity in our thinking about the environment and our efforts to preserve it. It is in this same vein that he also deals with our legacy: how will other intelligent life find out about us and maybe learn of our history and our disappearance. However, his conclusion, backed up by some of the arguments provided in this book, is rational, but still a lot to swallow: voluntarily limit our population and our growth rate. One child per family would eventually bring down the Earth's human population to a manageable 1Bn, which would allow us to live sustainably by their (author+experts) calculations.Now, my rational self tends to agree with their conclusion. I can't check their results, but the number seems pretty reasonable, in light of the facts. And I don't want to argue for alternative solutions because, unless we colonise other planets to ease the burden on planet Earth, we're pretty much screwed if we go on multiplying at the current rate. The thing is, I feel that by relinquishing the drive that is inherent in all lifeforms, the drive to procreate as much as possible in order to maximise survival, we are officially putting an end to evolution. We've actually begun to break away from the evolutionary force of natural selection some time ago, but this is the final nail in its coffin for me.So, in order to keep the world ""in working condition"", we're supposed to break away from it, become fully artificial, our being in the world regulated right from the initial idea of conception. Well, why not. We're already a force far superior to evolution because the outcomes of our actions are evident in a far shorter time-frame.See you through the looking-glass!"
52,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-Fiction. Weisman explores what would happen if humans were to become extinct, instantly, with no precipitating disasters. How would the Earth recover? This book is incredibly painful to read. I could have handled it if it were only speculation about what the world would be like without humans, but the truth is that we don't know what it would be like because we aren't going to disappear suddenly and we're probably going to make a big mess when we go. So already the scenario Weisman posits is irrelevant. He knows it, too. So instead of the expected, ""After we're gone, this and this and this will happen,"" we get the infinitely more depressing, ""This is how the Earth was before us; here's how we've changed it; this is how it might look after us."" Spoiler: It looks fucking awful now, never mind ten years from now, or fifty, or a thousand. This book is a laundry list of all the things we've done wrong as a species, starting with Clovis man overhunting the mammoth and ending with modern man scraping the tops of mountains off for coal, filling the oceans with tons of non-biodegradable garbage, killing billions of birds with our radio towers and domestic cats, poisoning the water supply with PCBs and heavy metals, creating a dead zone the size of New Jersey at the mouth of the Mississippi from fertilizer runoff, and overhunting the moa, dodo, bison, and passenger pigeon. It's unrelenting. And then I got to the chapter about nuclear power. Oh, what a mess we've made. What a mess we're making.As devastating as this book is, it would be even more effective if it were written better. It has some good information, but Weisman doesn't present it well. The narrative drags, a combination of wandering focus and awkward prose. I also caught at least one factual inaccuracy and found another statement that directly contradicted what I'd read elsewhere, so some of his research is in question. If you're looking for a book that takes a critical look at the exploitation of natural resources and how and why societies fall apart, I'd recommend Jared Diamond's Collapse instead. The writing is somewhat dry, but the structure is impeccable and his arguments are well supported. Weisman actually covers some of the same subjects -- the Maya, strip mining, the dodo -- but Diamond goes into a detail that makes this look superficial in comparison.Two stars. Not recommended unless you're looking for a way to learn the true meaning of Weltschmerz."
53,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/715626-joe,4,"Alan Weisman is a shrewd author. He knew that the people he needed to impress in order to sell this book would be influential, liberal elite, New York based, literary critics. He also was probably canny enough to know that most would simply read the first section, stop reading, and lie about reading the rest. The first section is what I thought the whole book would be like. That section goes through what would happen to New York City if all of humanity suddenly disappeared. I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic fiction and this definitely scratched that itch.The rest of the book was fine but I couldn't help feeling like it was somewhat of a bait-and-switch. I don't know why I wasn't expecting this to be a environmentalist slant to it but it did. Much of the book was ""if we don't change our ways this will happen"" and even more upsetting ""even if we do change our ways, all this other stuff will still happen."" That's why I've kind of come to a very Zen place with Environmentalism lately. I was super into it as a kid: I started an Environmental Club at my Junior High. I was a member of Greenpeace. I tried to make my own environmentally friendly ""crystal deodorant"" (It did not go well. Puberty is not the time to get cavalier with body odor protection.)But when I read stuff that says ""hey, we're super screwed even if we stop now"" I can't help but say, ""Oh, well I guess we shouldn't stop then."" I also have immense faith in humanity who has always been able to invent/discover/cure/explore our way out of danger. When pushed into a corner, we've always found a way out. That may be a naive view but there it is. (Don't worry guys, I still recycle and yes, I use real deodorant now.)Ok, sorry for the tangent. Even though it wasn't what I expected, the book was still quite entertaining and informative. It covered what would happen to Nuclear Power Plants, dams, plants, animals, trash, you name it. Spoiler alert, living on Earth after all the Nuclear Power Plants meltdown would not be pleasant for anybody. Dimes to donuts life would still thrive in the oceans and considering that most of Earth is ocean, I guess that's good news.There were also some interesting stories about war zones that are frozen in time and undisturbed. One shows how man-made items quickly decompose and one (the DMZ between North and South Korea) shows how land mines may have saved numerous species.A solid read but go into this with eyes wide open. If you're an anti-environmental lectures, you may want to skip this one and just watch ""The Walking Dead."""
54,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,5,"I disagree with the many reviews that refer to this book as “depressing.” The book's gotten a lot of publicity because it considers how the built environmental would deteriorate if mankind suddenly disappeared, but that’s by no means the beginning and end of Alan Weisman’s message. Yes, New York City’s subways would flood and our art would corrode, but the real story is of nature’s prospects for recovery in our absence. Examples include coral reefs re-equilibrating, and the rate at which ecological succession would go to work on our farms. In a nutshell: the world without us would cheerfully keep going. Very cheerfully, probably, if we powered down our petrochemical plants before we left. Yet for all that, this book is not meant to shame us into wishing we didn’t exist. If geological history tells us that the natural world withstood crises/change like pre-mankind mass extinctions, and if most flora and fauna is projected to recover from our impact once we’re gone, then theoretically we should be able to work towards a healthy earth while we’re here. The book is a simple challenge to prove that “intelligence really makes us special after all,” and use and preserve the natural world with common sense. Honestly that’s about the most preachy Weisman ever gets, which is another ‘plus’ for this book. His style is ironic when suitable, but as far as treating mankind as the enemy, he generally lets the record speak for itself. I personally enjoy the passages where he lets experts be his mouthpieces, because he doesn’t always go straight for university researchers (although they appear too). He also interviewed system workers and designers – for example, subway hydrologists who have developed a keen, level-headed respect for nature simply because they combat its impact on the built environment every day. But ultimately, the deterioration of human-made things (and humans themselves) is a humbling, thoroughly researched rhetorical device, meant to make us think and feel about our place in the world and in time. I give the book 4 ½ stars (or a Goodreads 5). The prose isn’t masterpiece-level or anything, but Weisman obviously has a good ear for language and is more than up to his ambitious task. "
55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758466-mark,2,"The basic premise of the book is a hypothesis on what would happen to our world if humans just suddenly disappeared. Not all living things, just humans. The author points out quite early on that nature would simply reclaim our built environment, in some cases quite rapidly, and he backs it up with a lot of scientific fact and expert opinions. There are some pretty interesting scenarios here, such as what will likely happen when there are no humans to monitor our built environment, such as the prevention of water into the Manhattan subway system, and in the vast petroleum fields of Houston. The author also uses some actual environments to illustrate his theories, such as Pripyat, Ukraine (Chernobyl) and the completely unpopulated town of Varosha in Cyprus (restricted from human access by the Turkish military since 1974). The book is slow going in other sections that stray from this theme. The chapter on the long-term impact of petroleum based plastics in our environment offered a few details I was not aware of, but was a little preachy and seemed off the subject. I was much more interested to learn that the Chunnel and Mount Rushmore may be our most long lasting man-made creations. Overall, it’s worth a look, but a tough book to read cover to cover. "

You realize how nature takes back the spaces that we invade. And you come to think about the footprint that we leave behind. Everything from plastics that never degrade to nuclear power plants that need us to take care of byproducts, this book covers it all. There are no religious or hypothetical speculation as to why everybody vanishes it only deals with what would happen if we were no longer here. What would happen to our pets? or domesticated livestock? What about vermin that live in the cities that we keep under control? It also looks at manmade structures that need constant upkeep like our bridges and highway systems. It really makes you think about the impact that humans have had on our planet. An awesome book that is perfect for Earth Day or any day. "

Much of this first part has been about the history of the world and our actions and effects on the fauna of different areas of the world. I find this history fascinating and sad. It says a lot about human nature. I think this should be required reading for high school students to learn about the history of man. If I were still teaching today and my students were not reading this book in another subject I'd try to find a way to work into my Home Ec curriculum!

In ""The World Without Us,"" Alan Weisman asks us to “picture a world from which we all suddenly vanished. Tomorrow” (4), whether as a result of an unspeakably efficient virus, a religious rapture, or alien kidnapping. The cause really doesn’t matter, because Weisman’s focus isn’t on us: it’s on the earth we would leave behind, the earth exactly as it is at this moment. “How would the rest of nature respond if it were suddenly relieved of the relentless pressures we heap on it and our fellow organisms? Could nature ever obliterate all our traces? How would it undo our…cities and public works…our plastics and toxic synthetics…our art, our many manifestations of spirit? (4)” While the book is eerie in spots (especially the description of a lone electrician cannibalizing spare parts in a silent, abandoned high rise hotel in Cyprus two years after civil war descended on the country in 1974), it poses a fair question. After all, how do we know just what our effects on the earth really are without answering what the earth would be like without us?Understand, Weisman isn’t asking from an attitude of “Oh, the whole planet would just be better off!” In fact, as chapter followed chapter, I was more and more impressed by the various situations human beings could not just abandon without the whole earth paying a huge price. One obvious advantage of us sticking around is our efforts to protect and promote threatened and endangered species. Another at least potential upside, is our ability not just to cease the activities that have placed so much stress on our planet but to commence activities that will counteract them—i.e. we have the power now not just to offset our carbon use but to find ways to sink the excess carbon we’ve already spewed into the atmosphere. If we were all to vanish tomorrow, our exhaust-spewing and CFC-emitting and DDT-spraying (still used all over the developing world) would stop, cold-turkey—probably a good thing, yes—but all of the carbon already in the atmosphere would just cycle slowly, slowly through the oceans, through plants, for millions of years before returning to pre-Industrial Revolution levels. Same sort of deal for mercury in the oceans, plastic in landfills, and nuclear waste…Speaking of which, Weisman actually details what the consequences would be if humans just stepped away from our 441 functioning nuclear power plants, our ICBMs, and temporary nuclear waste storage facilities. “Chernobyl” doesn’t even begin to cover it. Chernobyl’s cesium-137 and strontium-90 have 30-year half-lives (216). Weapons-grade plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,110 years (202). Uranium-235’s is 704 million years. U-238’s (“depleted” uranium) is 4.5 billion (205). The U.S. just began permanent storage of nuclear waste—in 1999, in New Mexico (206). Most is floating around, stored temporarily in holding tanks and waste processing facilities, and without humans to tend to their preservation and burial (cross your fingers for seismic stability), the earth would experience something on the order of at least 441 Chernobyls. Not to mention elevated levels of hydrogen cyanide, dioxins, furans, lead and chromium and mercury (140) from our countless oil refineries and petrochemical plants, two other enterprises that don’t really allow for a clean hasty exit. Thus, if nothing else, this book exposes the LaHaye/Jenkins ""Left Behind"" series as the worst kind of pulp fiction it is—more concerned with conservative fundamentalist Christian ideology than with the ultimate fate of God’s creation and created.Weisman does briefly touch on the religious dimensions of his question in a final chapter, entitled “Coda: Our Earth, Our Souls;” however, he mostly ignores the alternative futures and “end-time” scenarios proposed by various religions since they all focus almost exclusively on humankind’s ultimate destiny and not Earth’s. To Weisman, those destinies are inextricably linked. Weisman is a journalist, his prose reflects it, and for my part, I enjoyed his “facts first” approach. I believe that a true appreciation for the reality of any situation arises more from a knowledge of specific details than broad themes, and every so often, a particular detail in ""Without Us"" would leap off the page at me, shock and illuminate. For example, Weisman writes, in relation to the lifespan of plastic, “Would geologists millions of years hence find Barbie doll parts embedded in conglomerates formed in seabed depositions? Would they be intact enough to be pieced together like dinosaur bones? (124)” Ugh. Million-year-old Barbie doll fossils? Equally startling was the factoid that after the Battle of Waterloo, farmers were so desperate for fertilizer that the bones of horses and humans alike were ground down and applied to crops. Call me crazy, but the idea that even prim and proper 19th-century Europeans could be driven to semi-cannibalism did more to drive the fear of ballooning populations into me than any table of human caloric needs or UN Population Projections chart.However, I find myself dissatisfied with ""The World Without Us"" on two fronts. The first is that, though Weisman travels from South Korea to Hawaii, researches exhaustively, and interviews a veritable army of experts in his attempts to answer how the world would fare without us, the number of women whose views and projections find their way into his book is precisely zero. One, if you count the protagonist of Weisman’s prelude, “A Monkey Koan,” Ana María Santi, who speaks a patois of Quichua and Zápara in what amounts to an anecdote rather than a consultation, and two, if you count Noonkokwa, a Maasai woman married to a naturalist at an ecotourist lodge in Kenya (whose views ARE quoted in the book), who reportedly desires her family life, including number of children, to conform to the Maasai cultural norm. True, Weisman does cite many women in his acknowledgments, but why are their voices not heard in his book? This is especially disappointing to me, considering how by Weisman’s own admission in the acknowledgments, the original idea for the book came from Josie Glausiusz, an editor at Discover Magazine, and a woman. Don’t get me wrong, I’d rather hear exclusively from men if women of comparable expertise cannot be found, but anyone who contends that not enough women occupy high enough niches in the sciences to be cited at least once in a 275-page book that cites so many experts doesn’t have his/her head glued on straight. Perhaps I wouldn’t mind this so much (there’s nothing wrong with the substance of the book, after all), except in his “Coda: Our Earth, Our Souls,” Weisman proposes limiting “every human female on Earth capable of bearing children to one” as an “intelligent solution” to the problem of squaring increasing human needs with those of a planet not correspondingly growing (272). This to me is so unintelligent as to deserve the designation ‘wishful thinking,’ if not ‘nonsense.’ For starters, who would decide on this measure? Implement it? Enforce it? I’m sure no one wants to see the forced sterilizations such as those inflicted upon American women in the 1930s repeated all over the globe. Not to mention…I don’t know about you, but I’M not going to be the one to tell AIDS-ravaged Africa that it can’t produce as many children in the next few decades as it wants to; right or wrong, I’m not going there. However, the strongest argument against such a global one-child policy is embedded within Weisman’s book itself. In a chapter entitled “Where Do We Go From Here?” Weisman explores the merits of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) as well as the transhumanist/posthuman movement which advocates the jettisoning of our physical bodies in favor of immortal existence in a virtual reality created by software. Such moves would, Weisman agrees, decrease humanity’s earthly impact and ease the sorrow and weariness we feel watching our world slowly degrade. “The vision of a world relieved of our burden, with its flora and fauna blossoming wildly and wonderfully in every direction, is initially seductive. Yet it’s quickly followed by a stab of bereavement over the loss of all the wonder than humans have wrought amid our harm and excess. If that most wondrous of all human creations—a child—is never more to roll and play on the green Earth, then what really would be left of us? What of our spirit might be truly immortal?” (244). In the end, I think it is Weisman’s shared affection for both Earth and humanity, and his refusal to give up on either, that make his book so worth reading."

Then in no time at all planet earth will be devoid of humans. What happens in this post-human world is the imagined scenario in this brilliant, well-researched and excellently written book.But why would anyone even think of this dreadful possibility? Well, if you read this book and exercise a little imagination by pretending that you (as well as your family members) do not belong to the human race, you’d realize that human beings are worse than Ebola, Covid 19, Sars and the Spanish Flu combined. Humanity has done great things for itself but has done absolutely nothing good to the planet. Humans are malignant viruses infecting Mother Earth and will inevitably bring it to ruins unless they themselves are exterminated first. Humans have made a lot of other living beings on this planet extinct. They have poisoned the air, atmosphere, land and water of this planet. But without them the latter would surely heal. The concrete jungles they’ve built will become real jungles once again but this process of returning to the pre-human world will take a long, long time (in human terms). Take, for example, the metals and metallic-pollutants humans have made. Zinc would last 3,700 years; Cadmium, 7,500 years; Lead, 35,000 years; and Chromium, 70,000 years. Do you know that in our oceans there are miles upon miles of spots there where garbage and other human detritus coagulate like porridge in a pot? The North Pacific Gyre, for example, is calculated to have 3 million tons of plastic swimming on it. Where did these come from? From us. Not a day passes by where each and every one of us throw plastic to the garbage bin, which end up in landfills and could end up in our seas after flooding. In 1975, the book says, the U.S. Academy of Sciences had estimated that all oceangoing vessels together dump 8 million pounds of plastic annually in our oceans/seas. So you take a vacation and travel to some famous nature spots and ride a car, airplane or a cruise ship to go there. By doing so, however, you actually help DESTROY these beautiful scenic places you visit because motor vehicles, cruise ships and airplanes are among the worst pollutants mankind had ever invented. So which of Man’s creations would last the longest after we’ve all disappeared from the face of the earth? Probably those spaceships launched in the 1970’s carrying records of what we are (hoping that some intelligent aliens would someday stumble upon it) which could float there in outer space and beyond for billions of years. Or maybe , just maybe, it is what most of us utter helplessly now in quarantine during this pandemic—prayer:“Since the late 19th century, when, beginning with electrons, we got down to manipulating the most fundamental particles of the universe, human life has changed very fast. One measure of how fast is that, barely a century ago—until Marconi’s wireless and Edison’s phonograph—all the music ever heard on Earth was live. Today, a tiny fraction of 1 percent is. The rest is electronically reproduced on broadcast, along with a trillion words and images each day.“Those radio waves don’t die—like light, they travel on. The human brain also emanates electric impulses at very low frequencies: similar to, but far weaker than, radio waves used to communicate with submarines. Paranormalists, however, insist that our minds are transmitters that, with special effort, can focus like lasers to communicate across great distances, and even make things happen.“That may seem far-fetch, but it’s also a definition of prayer.” (p.274)"
65,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25300361-lacey,2,"How unsatisfying. This book does not tell the story that it advertises. Rather than exploring the idea of a world where humans suddenly ceased to exist, the book provides a present-day ecological study of human impact on the planet. That sounds like it's the same thing; trust me, it's not. I was really drawn to the speculative concept of the book: How long would it take various national and international landmarks to erode or fall away? How long would it take for cities and suburbs to be reclaimed by nature? How would pets and animals managed by humans adapt to life in the wild? The book hints at some of this; the first couple of chapters are very promising. We learn how man-made bridges are constructed to last for centuries, but only with routine maintenance, and how New York is basically one strong storm away from turning back into swamp land.The majority of the book, however, focuses on very local, unique extremes that can't really be extrapolated beyond a particular set of circumstances. For example, without humans, animals currently seeking refuge in the DMZ will be able to expand out and retake their natural habitats throughout Korea. Great? That's not much of a stretch, though. I could have put that together. Another chapter describes, in great detail, the migratory habits of various chimpanzee species and speculates at how similar early human migratory patterns may have been to them. Weisman wonders if one of these species may have evolved to become the Earth's dominant species, had we not been around. A valid read on the question of ""what would life on Earth be like without humans,"" but that's not the take I thought I was getting. Many of the chapters just felt like depressing info dumps of the damage humans are doing to the Earth. (And, yeah, ring that bell. I'm here for it. But, again, that's not what this book promised.)Overall, I'm a bit disappointed. There were a few interesting bits here and there — FYI: house cats will be just fine without humans, don't worry about it — but it would have benefited from an editor tbh."
66,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"This is one of those books that appeared on my radar from time to time, gently nudging me until I eventually broke down and decided to read it. I was sceptical of how interesting a book could be when its premise is a world without . . . well, us. In hindsight, that seems like a silly way of thinking about this book, since the only way to envision the ""world without us"" is to first consider the impact we've had on the world.And impact it we have. Alan Weisman carefully, painstakingly discusses the ways in which humanity has made its mark on the Earth. In some cases, such as modern cities, most art, and digital music, little vestiges will remain after a couple of hundred years. Other contributions of humanity, from bronze sculptures to the Statue of Liberty to isotopes from nuclear fallout, will remain much longer, extending into geological time. It's oddly comforting and disturbing to realize that we have permanently marked this planet.Weisman covers a plethora of topics in this book, to the point that it's almost unwieldy. Reading this in only a few days was probably a mistake; in retrospect, it's the sort of book that benefits from a chapter read here and there over the course of a month. And this book is, in some ways, a crash course in human history. Before we can know where the Earth is going, with or without us, it's worth looking at where the Earth was before we arrived on the scene. Even if you're not that interested in the book's main proposition, Weisman's depictions of how human evolution and development have changed the planet are fascinating.My favourite chapter concerned plastics and their eventual fate—grim, for the environment, according to Weisman. I'm young, so I take everything in this world for granted, including readily-available, omnipresent plastics in a variety of flavours and styles. So it's a reality check when Weisman points out that plastic is pretty much an artificial human invention. The polymers from which it's constructed are natural, but we've chained them together in synthetic ways, and we've only been doing it for about sixty years now. More to the point, all the plastic we've ever manufactured still exists (with the exception of a small cumulative amount destroyed when it's burnt). Where does the plastic go? We throw it away, and it lies in landfills, leaches into the water tables, ends up in the oceans . . . where it breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces of powder and gets taken up by even the tiniest sea creatures, who don't find it very healthy. And I knew, before reading this book, that carelessly wasting plastic and throwing it away wasn't a smart or environmentally-conscious attitude, but I didn't know exactly how plastics affected our environment.Also a twentieth-century artifact, the atomic era has fundamentally changed our planet. Detonations from nuclear bombs and waste from nuclear reactors have released isotopes into the atmosphere that don't occur in nature. Some of these isotopes will remain long, long after we're gone, probably until the Earth itself gets swallowed by the expanding sun. As with the discussion about plastics, it's mind-boggling to think that we're forced to sit down and consider ways of labelling nuclear waste dumps so that people 100,000 years from now (or something that replaces us in that time) won't stumble into them.I was less fascinated by the less permanent effects of our presence. Weisman's analysis of how modern cities like New York would hold up without human maintenance and activity didn't enchant me, but your mileage may vary. The same goes for the penultimate chapter about sea life . . . thematically and structurally, it brought the book back to the beginning, but it felt very stale. There's a great deal of literature about the unique biodiversity of the oceans, so I'm glad Weisman only re-tread that ground for a single chapter. Finally, the epilogue took on a weird, pseudo-spiritual tone probably designed as an appeal to pathos that I just found distracting. I don't need to hope for paranormal thought re-incarnation; for me, the beauty is in the science.That beauty is manifest whether or not humanity exists. And let's face it: one day, we'll go extinct. It happens to the best of species. The best we can do is make the most of our situation, try to hang on for a while longer, and enjoy our time while it lasts. So why not take care of the planet? The World Without Us is mostly a thought experiment, with little ""practical application."" Obviously we won't be able to do anything to affect the world after we're gone.So why bother with this book? Firstly, it gave me insight into what various scientists and experts do to study the world around us. There are people who devote their lives to studying plastic levels in the ocean or making sure that the New York subways don't flood (and I have a great deal more respect for them!). Secondly, it encourages us to think about our impact, not just on a massive climatic level—global warming is only a part of the problem—but on a systemic, component-based level.Weisman clearly has strong feelings on what we need to do to strike a better balance, but the book itself is rather unbiased. It doesn't say we have to massively restructure society to bring it into harmony with nature. Weisman mentions some proposed solutions by various people and identifies certain practices that we still need to phase out (remember those nasty chlorofluorocarbons? Yep, still around). Overall, however, this isn't a book that advocates dumping your car and riding a bike; Weisman isn't telling you to stop using toilet paper.Instead, The World Without Us is about environmental awareness in the truest sense of the word. Globalization has made human civilization so connected and complex that it's difficult for individuals to understand how their actions impact the planet. The food I eat may come from halfway around the world; the materials used to manufacture my desk or electronic devices or car were mined and processed and fabricated on every inhabited continent. The World Without Us offers a glimpse of the global chain reaction our consumption and production perpetuates. At times it's long-winded and disorganized . . . Weisman tends to repeat himself, and I admit I skimmed some of the chapters that I found less captivating. But that doesn't detract much from the quality of the book. It covers so much that there's bound to be one item that resonates you . . . and that's all it takes. While far from perfect, this is a thought-provoking read that I recommend to pretty much anyone who wants to expand his or her horizons."

Well, nature definitely does. This book discusses how long certain buildings will last, including skyscrapers, canals, dams, oil rigs, and nuclear power plants. As you might expect, there is also a lot of discussion about plastic in our oceans--I had no idea ""nurdles"" were such a problem.Alan Weisman chooses some interesting places to show our effect on the Earth. I didn't know the Korean DMZ was an unintentional refuge for endangered species, or that there is similar situation on Cyprus. He goes through humanity's evolutionary history out of Africa in order to show the effect we've had on each continent we've colonized, and also to discuss how many species could return to prominence if we were gone.If this seems like a strange series of topics, it is. The book is disjointed, and it was sometimes hard to want to keep reading when every chapter starts in a totally new place. As you can imagine, many of these topics are quite sad, such as the discussion of human bodies in coffins. He does share some hope, possibly fixing our planet or looking to a different one. But for the most part, I think this is meant to be a call to action, and I think it would be a good reminder for anyone who is willing to think about the serious consequences that could lie ahead."

They all wish that they, and only they, were allowed to see the natural world unspoiled and uninterrupted. As though the presence of anyone else diminishes their own appreciation of the world, to which they alone have a natural right. Hell, we all do it. “The World Without Us” fills a niche created by this kind of attitude, and it does so extremely well. What would the world be like if humans were to disappear entirely? By definition none of us would be able to visit such a world, but this book gives us a glimpse of what it might look like and what it would be like to be the only tourist in the whole world. Several chapters of “The World Without Us”, including the first two, read like a reverse maintenance manual. The book wisely opens with a chapter of the impermanence of houses, a subject that any homeowner can easily relate to. It came as little surprise to me that within a few short decades, my house would be little more than crumbled remains and some PVC piping. Weisman then describes how skyscrapers, bridges, dams, and farms would fall apart in the absence of human caretakers. Reading these chapters, I could almost sense the pride of the worker who runs the pumps that keep the New York subway system from flooding. Weisman is at his best when he is describing the decay and collapse of the most familiar objects in our world, although the book does occasionally feel disjointed. Although we are frequently told how long certain things will last in our absence, you will probably never get a good sense of the progression of decay across human and geological time unless you are keeping track on a spreadsheet. This is because Weisman arranges the book based on similar types of objects (the aforementioned houses, bridges, dams, etc), but never gives us a global time line of what would happen in the years and centuries following the disappearance of humans. There are also no fewer than five times when he describes something, whether it is Bronze Age statues, radio transmissions, or toxic waste dumps, as “one of our longest lasting legacies...” This gets a bit tedious, and if we were shown the forest instead of the trees we might have a better appreciation of the effects of unimaginable timescales. My only other complaint about the writing is that Weisman occasionally lists species of plants and animals without telling us what they are. A typical example: “plants like chickweed and stinging nettle were showing up there, and within 10 years filbert, hawthorn, ash, and oak”. Not that we need a complex discussion of the characteristics of each plant, but it would help to at least know if these are weeds, shrubs, trees, flowers, and so on. Oh well, I guess that's what Wikipedia is for.“The World Without Us” is much more than idle speculation, especially when dealing with the reemergence of plants and animals. Weisman uses evidence from paleontology and archeology to determine what life was like before humans and then extrapolates this to a future without humans. I found it frustrating that there was no solid evidence about the fate of plastics, petrochemicals, and nuclear waste, although this is hardly the fault of the author. Our lack of knowledge about the decomposition of some materials is an important thing to convey to readers.Weisman does not come out and say what action he thinks we should take but it seemed clear to me that he is sympathetic to the ideals of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, a representative of which he interviews. This attitude is a bit tough to swallow for me; as terrible as humans' environmental legacy might be, we are still part of this world and I believe that we can coexist if we all make enough effort. On this topic Weisman is silent; we are given no prescription for what we can do to help remove humanity's destruction from the earth. I found this to be a strength of “The World Without Us”. Environmental activism is a moral and political issue, and avoiding that hornet's nest helps the book feel more objective. This book does an excellent job of treading carefully between many possible pitfalls; it never feels too pessimistic, cynical, fanciful, or hopeful. Hopefully the realistic and straightforward approach will inspire readers to take whatever action they see fit to help minimize our impact on planet Earth, without the need to eliminate the human race."
75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,5,"I've had The World Without Us on my TBR list ever since I saw the pilot to the History Channel's Life After People TV series. I wish I would've read it earlier as I found it to be a fascinating and in-depth thought experiment albeit disheartening, with an undercurrent of gloom and doom, but with a sliver of hopefulness peaking through the clouds. This is a book I wish everyone would read as it addresses what is happening to this life-sustaining spaceship we are traveling through our solar system on. The premise of the book is this: what would happen if humans suddenly disappeared? I was expecting a book about what would happen to human-made structures such as dams, skyscrapers, dams, our houses, bridges, etc. But the scope of the book is much broader than this. The author addresses the fate of aforementioned things as well as a good number of others that would be (mostly favorably) affected by the lack of homo sapiens such as wild animals around the world, the seas, the atmosphere, and the overall climate. In most of his examples he describes what nature / places were like prior to homo sapiens, how our changes are affecting them now, and what would happen if we went away. Surprise: prior to homo sapiens (and pre-humans) many now-extinct plants and animals, especially megafauna, flourished. Rule of thumb: where humans go, mass extinction follows. If humans went away the plants and animals which survived us would come back with a vengeance - nature will reclaim its planet. A fascinating example of what an area was like before and after humans is Manhattan, which was part marshy bog, part hilly, and full of brooks and streams before it was leveled, filled in, and developed in to what it is today. After humans, the pumps which keep the underbelly of the city dry will eventually fail and the lower infrastructure will flood and gradually corrode and erode, and over time destabilize the large buildings' bases. While pavement cracks and the forest moves back in to reclaim its territory, the storm winds will eventually topple the weakened skyscrapers. It will revert to back to a woody, wildlife-filled space within a concrete jungle. Also particularly interesting is what would befall nuclear plants (big problems if they aren't shut down), petrochemical plants (same story), and all the unused CFCs contained it air conditioners, refrigerators, and vehicles which will gradually leak in the the atmosphere. You might think that the earth would return to an unspoiled paradise but unfortunately Homo sapiens have done so much damage to the planet that this is impossible. For some things, like plastics and nuclear power, it is too late to turn back. The section in the book about plastics is depressing. Plastic waste is now found everywhere. The oceans are full of it, and it isn't just floating on the surface. Tiny plastic micro-beads are found in the bellies of fish and turtles, and stuck in jellyfish. This insane proliferation of plastic waste has taken place in less than fifty years, and plastic production has escalated. Even if humans disappeared today, plastics will be a planetary issue for hundreds and hundreds of years. Nuclear waste will be an issue for thousands of years. In the acknowledgements one gets the sense of the amount of research and travel the author did for this book. He traveled to all continents except Antarctica and Australia, visiting pristine forests, African jungles, the arctic tundra, petrochemical plants, major cities, etc. He even got special clearance from the North and South Koreans to visit the DMZ, which is a 5 km wide path along the border which humans have abandoned and nature reclaimed since the war ended. Additionally, he lists an impressive number of experts consulted for this book. The book also contains a lengthy bibliography and extensive index. I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone interested in earth science or the hypothetical fate of the planet if humans were wiped out. With our without us, the earth will only survive another five billion or so years as it will be swallowed up by our sun when it becomes a red giant. After that, all that will be left of humanity will be our radio and TV transmissions and any spacecraft which escaped the sun's gravity. Until then, we need to get our act together and start treating our oasis in space much better. "

This is one of those books. In answer to the question, “What would happen to the world if humanity were to disappear”, Weisman takes us on an exploration of the planet and the pressures under which its ecologies exist all thanks to our species.This book was recommended as part of my research for a novel I’m writing, but I very quickly forgot this was supposed to be research, and got sucked into the somewhat depressing realisation of exactly how badly the human races has mucked up the planet.Weisman has taken a very broad view, speaking to a vast collection of scientists and discussing how such magnificent cities such as New York would handle even a few years of neglect, down to the European and American forests, and how quickly these would reclaim the land. Very soon readers realise that mankind’s physical imprint in concrete and metal wouldn’t last very long and, in fact, would fall down and be covered in soil within a few hundred years.Not so impermanent, however, are our plastics. From the tiny specks ingested by molluscs to the giant patches of plastic garbage floating in our seas, these man-made substances don’t just conveniently go away. Many have a long-term impact on the environment.Equally frightening is the issue of our nuclear reactors. Even one the size of Chernobyl has had a disastrous impact on the landscape. Now imagine all the world’s reactors melting down within a short space of time. Not a pretty picture.Weisman also looks at megafaunal extinctions in a way I hadn’t previously considered, and gives a clue as to why Africa still has its megafauna largely intact. For now. He also suggests why ancient South American civilisations faded—a dire warning to contemporary society with its love of bling. Not only does he look toward the earth, but Weisman also casts his eye toward space, discussing a number of the probes that have been sent out, and also the probability of any sign of us being discovered by possible sentients in the galaxy and beyond.Weisman ends this account with a visit to the coral reefs, and with more than enough disquieting observations that all point accusatory fingers back at us and the way we’ve ruined this planet.These are just a few of the topics upon which Weisman touches, but I stepped away from this book with a new appreciation for exactly how impermanent mankind is. If we were to somehow succeed in wiping ourselves out, life will go on without us. An important fact we need to understand is that life on this planet is dynamic. Nothing stays the same. At times in the past there have been great extinctions, from which a diverse multitude of living organisms rebounded. If we were to be the catalyst for another extinction (which is not unlikely) life would find a way to adapt and, eventually, once again proliferate.Our time, as a species, is so incredibly brief compared to what has passed, and possibly that which is yet still to come to pass once we’ve gone the way of the dinosaurs. All this will end. But we, as a species, need to come to our senses, and fast, lest we hit our evolutionary dead end far sooner than intended."

The pickings were, unsurprisingly, slim, but I found a copy of The World Without Us and decided to give that a try. After all, we were going to Colorado to get away from the city, and perhaps this was simply an extreme version of the same proposition.The intent of the book is to extrapolate what would happen to the world if humans suddenly vanished: what would return to the way it was before we emerged, and what wouldn't, and how long it would take. The author doesn't consider questions of how or why humans would disappear; giving us up for lost, he focuses on the fate of the rest of the world.The concept is interesting (and the cover design, by the way, excellent) but as I read my attention wandered. The writing style left me cold, approaching every disaster, large or small, with the same tone of muted breathlessness. Parts of the book are dedicated to borderline tedious descriptions of, for example, a house collapsing year by year. Other sections concern Pleistocene megafauna and other more successfully mind-blowing topics, but their relevance is not readily apparent.As the book goes on, it has an increasing environmental bent. The chapters about petrochemical and nuclear plants are disturbing, because the subtext is that Very Bad Things that could happen even if people were still around. But this brings me back to the original premise of the book, which is that humans disappear suddenly, and everything else stays the same. How would this happen? In the introduction, the author mentions a Homo sapiens-specific virus, or ""some misanthropic evil wizard"" sterilizing us, or the rapture. These scenarios strike me as exceedingly unlikely, even within the realm of unlikely possibilities. Why not take a talent for writing and research and turn it to examining real problems, rather than writing a fantasy without much imagination?To give the author credit, the book has a number of high points--interesting set pieces and conversations with experts--but they are not well connected. Most of the interesting points seem able to be covered in a given href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/13/boo..., which makes me think that, like so many works of narrative nonfiction these days, this one may have been better off in its original incarnation as href=""http://discovermagazine.com/2005/feb/... magazine article."

Its strength lies in not really caring about how humanity leaves the world, or speculating on it, the author just takes the assumption ""what if we were all just gone some day"", and looks on the impact this has in an ecological and evolutionary sense on everything left behind, from animals to remnants of our society.The book throws a really wide net and in that lies both its strength and its weakness. It refuses to tackle topics like the evolution of species without casting back into the past for context, which is good as it gives the reader a wider understanding, but it is also bad in that it lets the book meander too much on topics that aren't of direct interest, and at times it slips into a moralizing ecological tale. It stands astride a dispassionate look at the world post-human and an ecologically moralizing narrative and as such really doesn't satisfy either goal, and would have benefited from more focus and clearer goals.As someone who picked it up with more interesting post-human developments than ecological moralizing, I was still very engaged by the detail and thought put into what would happen to different things we leave behind: houses versus over-designed metal bridges, the non-biodegradability of plastic (again, this is one point where the moralizing easily slips in), the huge environmental impact of what happens to nuclear power plants and - perhaps more surprisingly even worse - oil refinery plants in Houston and elsewhere. The book is not necessarily wrong in its ecological thoughts, but as a reader who did not come in for that it feels more like an unwelcome distraction.Between those two topics, it's never clear exactly what the World Without Us wants to argue. It reads a bit like an academic piece from someone with insufficient academic training, it does not do enough to clearly guide you along its own arguments or to pace its structure and points in a strong manner. All this makes it a less useful and less engaging read than it should be, but it's still worthwhile for post-human/post-apoc aficionados."

Alan Weisman is a Professor Laureate in Latin American Studies and Journalism at the University of Arizona so this gave me the chance to listen to a professor at the school and perhaps understand something about how my son is being educated. The University of Arizona has a core curriculum that integrates different disciplines around a common topic. Weisman's book is a great example of how this concept can work in a book. Weisman brings together history, environmental science, materials science, and political science around a common theme of what would happen to the world if people suddenly disappeared. While not overt, the implication is that people, both collectively and individually, are responsible for their decisions, so additionally, this book includes ethics. Weisman goes around the globe and discusses the impact that humans are having on the planet now and in the past. Some of the topics he touches on are AIDS in Africa, how humans drove megafauna into extinction, nuclear power, and human population growth.College professors are assigning this book to students because within it is a glimmer of hope, and this glimmer depends upon the next generation changing the trajectory of human destruction. People of all ages and education levels who want to be part of this discussion and part of this change should read this book. Thank you, Weisman, for getting me to consider with renewed vigor how I can lighten my load on the planet.I have read some of the criticisms of the book. Yes, it is a bit depressing. Yes, it is a bit repetitive. Yes, it is a bit academic. I found it a topic worth considering, but this is perhaps not true for everyone."

I learned a lot about the infrastructure of NYC, petrochemical plants, and nuclear reactors - how they operate and how they could come apart. From flooding subway tunnels to nuclear meltdowns to refinery disasters to the strength of ceramics and plastics - he describes how all will decay and eventually vanish without people. However, (contrary to what I had hoped) this book was not really about decaying cities. Most of the book is an indictment of the destructive nature of man-kind on the environment.His main premise - that Homo Sapiens has ruined the world, and must now severely limit procreation in order toheal it - is quite interesting when you think it through logically. So, blind chance has produced the creatures most fit to survive and they have figured out that they need to destroy themselves for the good of all the others? Without this 'interference' from Homo Sapiens we cannot repair our previous 'interference' with nature?? Hmmm...I had never heard of the VHEMT (voluntary human extinction movement) - so that was an education (!) as was his suggested future where manmade machines acting as vessels of human consciousness could carry on our 'being' far from earth on another planet.This was a book without hope. While I agree that humans have been wasteful, careless, and greedy, as a believer in God, I have hope. We need to be better stewards because we have been given the task of caring for the earth and everything in it - including mankind. We are the only beings who are created in the image of God, and I confidently put my trust in Him who has promised the ultimate renewal of all things by his goodness and through the means of His children."

This book does absolutely nothing to dispel that feeling. I had a firm grasp of the various ways in which the human population has destroyed the planet, but it is still difficult to read it all encompassed into one book without wanting to scream bloody murder. Unfortunately even if the scenario in the book becomes reality, all humans disappearing by means that only destroy us, we have still left nearly irreversible harm behind. Radioactive waste that has a HALF-LIFE of 4.5 billion years? Literally incomprehensible in human time. Our sun isn't even expected to be the same by around this time but half of Uranium-238 deposits will be here! Plastics, which are a horrendous plague upon the Earth and seas especially, are another major issue and we've only managed to do that in about half a century! Human creations will seemingly forever (at least NEARLY so) harm the Earth and it pains me to think of all the irreversible damage done upon it simply due to the ability to do so, greed, arrogance and general disregard. Perhaps anyone touting the greatness of humans should read the book, it might knock your pedestal down a peg or two.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt Weisman could have been more detailed in portions and more concise in others. I think the topic of climate change could have been expounded upon as well, although emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases would be severely limited once we perish plus there are a number of ways in which global warming can go--the entire book could have been dedicated to it!"

This book is a continuation on that theme. Somebody asked him a question: what happens if the entire humanity disappears, not from an ecological disaster or a war, but simply vanishes instantly? If you want to get a feeling for how big of an impact we’ve had on the planet, read this book to find out what could happen in our absence. Weisman has an impressive knowledge in botany, zoology, architecture, geology, agriculture, marine biology, etc.The disappearance of humanity, turned from a thought experiment in this book into reality, is not a bad idea, even if it’s done by a massive ecological disaster or a nuclear war that takes down other species as well. Us just not being here is good for the planet and life in the long run. Life has survived bigger disasters and has picked and prospered with more forms. I’ve always thought how good it would be to get rid of the whole lot of us and give evolution another – and possibly a much better – shot at restarting and coming up with new life forms. Think of how good the Precambrian disaster was that eventually advanced life and dawned the era of the dinosaurs, or how good it was that later on a giant meteor hit the earth and ended their era and gave reign to mammals that eventually put us here. Our extinction is inevitable, weather by our own doing or another natural disaster – and it will be celebrated. We’ve fucked up bad. "

Although George's usual guests are crystal rubbing muppets from Xenon this guest actually wrote an interesting book. I have to wonder if the author even knew what radio show he was on. The book describes the impermanence of humanity's impact on the globe. Long after we are gone their will still be mountains of plastic but even this will be absorbed or degraded into nothingness. Time is the active agent and for our part, we are nothing but a side note. Even the seemingly immovable structures of the pyramids will be swept clean through the long term process of glaciation. Once we are gone and several million years have passed the earth will return to a natural equilibrium. Future archaeologists from Xenon will in all likelihood find little evidence of our existence. Ironically our last message in a bottle will likely come in the form of an ""I Love Lucy"" episode. For the last 60 years we have been broadcasting from our pale blue dot waves and waves of TV signals. Future civilizations are more likely to pick up on this artifact than any tangible object we have built on the earth. Hopefully they won’t judge us too harshly.Very interesting book. Despite its gloomy outlook on mankind, it gave me a sense of hope that better things will happen following our brief moment in time."

Now, don't get me wrong, it's entirely possible that I could read a book like that, as well... but that's not what I was pitched and not what I was expecting or wanting, at this time.My favourite bit was the descriptions of what would happen to Manhattan Island, after humans disappeared. Discussions about the subways, the skyscrapers, flooding, collapse, different plant and animal species that would overtake. That was great.

Being a homeowner *is* a constant battle against the elements, all of which want to bugger your house if you so much as go a single goddamn year without painting or panelling or whateverthefucking SOMETHING. Not that I'm bitter."

That conceit - humanity vanishing overnight - was my biggest stumbling block. It's a best-case scenario, after a fashion. The Earth's bound to get worse since we're not really going anywhere.The author goes into considerable detail and the science (to a scientist of a sort) seems solid.

Even small steps are steps in the right direction. I would rather not envision a world without us."
