0,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2032228-heather,5,"As I am not a scientist like some other reviewers, I found this book to be quite enlightening. It was well-written and entertaining, as well.Things I learned:People need to use both rational thought and emotion to make the best decisions.We need to make our own mistakes because that is how our brains get rewired not to do it again. Emotions turn mistakes into educational events and then use those lessons unconsciously.We get cranky when we're hungry and tired because the prefrontal cortex is the first to lose energy and consequently the ability to suppress negative emotions. Teenagers are more impulsive because the prefrontal cortex is also the last part of the brain to develop, and ADHD happens when kids' brains are slow to develop.Abuse is repeated among generations because abused children's brains are permanently damaged/fail to create the appropriate connections and never mature morally.Rationality can be a liability when it leads to rationalization. Embrace uncertainty: entertain competing hypotheses and remind yourself of what you don't know.Difficult decisions (those with numerous factors involved) are best made by taking in all the facts, sleeping on it, and ultimately relying on your feelings. ""Even when you choose to ignore your emotions, they are still a valuable source of input."""
1,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"For the first half of this book I was rather annoyed. The problem was that I had heard most of the stories before and I was thinking that what I should do is write a ‘how to write a popular book on decision making’ style review. As with anyone who has found themselves on Good Reads for a while, I now can’t read a book without thinking, at the same time, how I’m going to review it. You know, in this type of book it seems there has to be an American Football story, a plane crash or two or maybe even three, it might help if there is something about jam or tomato ketchup or the great Pepsi/Coke Wars, perhaps also a digression into why cheap wine actually tastes as good as expensive wine, followed, perhaps, by a story about someone in an actual war making a remarkably lucky guess that the blip on the radar screen is an incoming enemy missile rather than a friendly plane returning to base and then, while we are on wars, the book will probably need something about an Arab-Israeli war (the Yom Kippur one seems to be a perennial favourite when it comes to decision making texts). There are also a list of psychological tests that need to be discussed – emotionally depraved monkeys with their wire mothers (to be compared with Romanian orphans and psychopaths), the endless bowl of soup test always rates a mention, as does the lost movie ticket dilemma as to whether you would pay for another one. My annoyance, then, was around the fact that I felt I had heard every single example in this book at least once before. I kept thinking that this subject of the psychology of judgement and decision making doesn’t seem to have moved along much since the book The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making was published last century. I thought my review would say that this book is not a bad summary of the field, but any one of a number of other books is probably just as good. I stopped worrying about what I would say in my review about half way through and that is why this book has been given five stars rather than the three I was thinking of giving it.Look – I have an irrational annoyance that seems to develop when I read too many case studies. I think it is because the case study is the favourite ploy of the self-help book. The long and dramatic case studies that start the early chapters of this book were probably too long and too dramatic and just made me think that I’m probably never going to be a quarterback. And I guess that stranger things have happened, but I also doubt that even following the worst of circumstances (and we can take it for granted that I virtually never eat seafood, so according to the plots of a thousand disaster films I am likely to be the only person left who is physically fit enough to land the plane) that even so I’ll never actually be the one left to do so. What these case studies gain in dramatic effect they tend to lose in, well, relevance. I think, ‘oh God, he is really going to talk to me for hours about some guy who is good a throwing a ball’. The only person I don’t mind talking to me about American rules football or plane crashes is Malcolm Gladwell – but that is because I love Gladwell’s writing so much that sometimes I worry that he could write an article saying that Hitler has been grossly maligned by history and was actually quite a nice guy and I might even be fooled into believing he has a point. So, having said all that and made it clear that there were bits of this book that didn’t work for me, it pains me to say that this book is the book that I wish Gladwell had written rather than Blink. The premise of Blink is that there are times when you haven’t thought through all of the logical, rational steps, but then, in a blink of the eye, you know stuff. Gladwell’s point is you should trust the stuff you know in that way (that non-rational way) because it is often right. Well, accept when it is wrong – then you shouldn’t trust your instincts. Stating his premise quite so boldly might make the problem with Blink stand out. How can you tell when to trust your gut and when to trust your head? Blink isn’t really very good at answering that dilemma (if dilemma is the right word – you know, limiting our choices to just two makes life nicely black and white, but sometimes life has shades of grey and other times even comes in technicolour).When this book gets into its stride it runs through the sorts of cognitive errors that we are likely to make when we make decisions. One of the stand out causes of errors we make is loss aversion, that is, we are likely to make bad decisions if we feel we have already made a loss (part of the reason gamblers might bet more after losing a bet – double or nothing anyone?) and we are likely to act differently when things are stated as successes – the drug may cure 40% of patients – than as a loss – if we use this drug up to 60% of patients may die – even if they say exactly the same thing. The book also says some interesting things about how the Golden Rule isn’t actually a gift to the world by Judeo-Christian religion, but is rather a consequence of our being social animals. Empathy is an essential precondition to our living successfully in society and so it didn’t really require a Jesus or Moses to create these rules, all they did was to codify them. This is made clear by the fact that some social monkeys, one can assume they have not met Jesus, also act in accordance with the Golden Rule. Clearly, some Christians are going to find certain parts of this book challenging, but then, it is seeking to explain why we make mistakes on the basis of our biological evolution, so I guess certain Christians are always going to have problems with that.There are things I really liked about this book. Those are summed up in the last couple of chapters which are worth reading all on their own the next time you are in a book shop (in fact, I think, if I had written this book, I would have started at the end). There is absolutely no harm in reading the Coda before you start reading this book as it will give a wonderful map of where you are going and let’s face it, this is not a murder mystery. Essentially this book says that there are good and bad times to use your rational brain to make decisions and that there are times when the best decisions you can make are those you will make by relying on your emotions. He says, perhaps counter-intuitively, that the decisions best left to your emotional brain are the ones that are complex and multifaceted – that is, the ones we generally try to solve with our rational brains. Our brains aren’t very good at reasoning through problems like which car should I buy. Problems like that have too many variables – not just which colour looks best, but also should I get side air bags and ABS brakes or what about fuel efficiency and service history, and... His advice is for you to gather facts as you may, but then that you should take a break from ‘thinking’ for a couple of days and then go with your emotions. It might be easier to follow this advice by looking at when you should make decisions based on reason. Essentially, if the problem can be broken down into numbers (the odds are six to one that…) then reason needs to play a role in your decisions. If the problem has few variables then reason can cope with that and won’t be overloaded. If the problem is sufficiently novel – that is, you are in a situation in which you have never been before, you need to avoid relying on your emotions and you need to try to think. But you should rely on your emotional (or perhaps automatic is a better word) brain for things you do all of the time. If you have been driving for years don’t try to think about when to lift the clutch and when to take your foot off the brake or you will end up in an accident. Sometimes thinking is the last thing you need to do. You know, it is a matter of ‘use the force Luke’. Having said that, there are also times when your automatic brain will have trapped you into patterns of behaviour which are self-defeating. So, you shouldn’t use your automatic brain then, you should try to think of new ways of doing things.This book is not trying to tell you that there are times when you should not think at all – it is telling you that you should always think about the decisions you are making and how you are making those decisions, but to also understand that we are human and we ALL tend to rationalise our behaviour (a wonderful book on this subject is Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts) and that if you can possibly do it, seeing when you were wrong and trying to learn from those times is as close to being godlike as we humans get.There is a fascinating discussion in this book about some guy testing the accuracy of political pundits. My understanding of what happened is that a psychologist asked a series of both right and left wing commentators what they believed was likely to happen next – the alternatives were phrased so as to give three possible outcomes (things will get worse, things will get better, things will stay the same). The result was that virtually all of the social commentators did worse than chance in their guesses. That is, you would have done better by asking a monkey to pick the answer out of a hat. And it didn’t matter if they were right wing scum or left wing loonies, what determined how wrong they were going to be was how confident and certain they were about their prediction. The more certain, the more wrong.The more open you are to the possibility you may be wrong the more likely you are to be right. The more prepared you are to listen to others, the less likely you are to stuff up. The more consciously people set up ways in which their views will be challenged the more likely they are not to be fooled by their own bullshit. It is The Wisdom of Crowds again.If that doesn’t make this book worth five stars, I’ve no idea what would."

Yes, I understand that one should cite oneself, but I can also understand why this would fail to occur to an author.But seriously? Plagiarising Gladwell?Making up quotes from Bob Dylan? Taking quotes from Wikipedia and pretending that they were interviews?What makes one decide to do that?Do explain."
3,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,5,"I probably would not have read this book had it not been recommended by someone whose opinions I respect and the fact that the Kindle version was selling for only $2.99 at the time.I'm really glad now that I didn't miss it. Most of the science books I choose to read are interesting but very few are also what I would call “entertaining”. This book was. As other reviewers have mentioned I too am leery when I start to read a book that immediately launches into a case study, because this can sometimes be a sign of lazy writing. But in this case I found the examples fascinating (I had not read about them, or had forgotten them) and illustrative of the points the author was trying to make.It's also always great fun when you get to shoot down some old experts—in this case Plato, Kant, Freud and others.I always assumed—no, knew—that there was a war going on inside my head between the rational and emotional parts of my brain. Now I learn that these 2-ways can be 3-ways and more, that several parts of the brain may weigh in on certain types of decisions.There's a wealth of information here that is useful as well as enlightening. In fact there is so much that I fear I may fall victim to one of the decision-making hazards the author discusses in which the rational part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, becomes overwhelmed by too much information. The basic message though is simple: the key thing is to think about when making a decision is how you are thinking.It's nice when you get to learn something about the latest advances in a field of science and find yourself being entertained at the same time. And who knows, you might even make some good decisions."
4,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,1,"03/28/14 Update.I don't know where this review went, but I'm putting it back.11/09/13 Update.This is why Goodreads needs to separate itself from Amazon, and why Amazon sucks: http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Decide-J...An average of four stars, the ""most helpful negative review"" is three stars, and the main page and 'negative review' doesn't mentions Lehrer's little plagiarism problem or the fact that the publisher recalled the book--they actually offered refunds. This is why I don't bother with Amazon reviews, and this is why GR will go the way of the dodo.http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Decide-J...7/14/13 Update.What to do, what to do, what to do. The book is being pulled by the publisher and refunds offered. Clearly, something's wrong. I loved the ideas, even if they weren't Lehrer's, but now I'm afraid he deserves a permanent ban from my to be read pile. I find myself questioning how much was fabricated because he wanted it to be true rather than because there was support for it being true.Self-plagiarism isn't a problem to me as much as the blatant made-up quotes (see link on Bob Dylan), quotes suspiciously congruent to other authors (see Malcolm Gladwell connection), using Wikipedia as a source and furiously lying through his teeth when discovered.Thanks to Carly's review for awareness of the issue.**********************************************Very fascinating book. Lots of insight into the human mind written in very accessible language. Does not commit the cardinal sin of listing many case studies and then drawing conclusions; instead Lehrer helps make neurobiology and scientific studies accessible by explaining the study and then giving a case study in action. I plan on purchasing this book at some point so that I can think more about the concepts covered and their implications in my own life. He covers basically, how we make decisions, using an emotional brain, a logical brain (aka prefrontal cortex) as well as other areas of the brain. Ultimately by providing more insight into the decision making process, he is hoping to empower us to make better decisions for ourselves.The first part on emotional brain helped me understand even more why clicker training is so powerful, another area of interest for me. He later makes the interesting point that it is the rational brain we should consult for small, less global decisions (his ""which jam"" examples) because it is well equipped to parse out the small number of variables needed to decide. This is opposed to the emotional brain, which is actually better equipped to make large global decisions (new couch? which car?) that have multiple areas of data of varying importance. He shows us a little about our desire to find patterns, and how this leads us into decision making traps in finances and gambling. Aversion to loss and our desire to be certain are also fascinating concepts in this book. I also liked that he gave a short chapter at the end summing up the different chapters, and how this information can be integrated into the reader's life.Occasionally some of the examples are too detailed or too long to make his point as well as they could. The section on gambling, for instance, contained an explanation of a kind of poker. Not being a gambler, I had a hard time following the technical terms he used throughout the pages of the example. I suspect, however, that many examples of sports figures and gambling are meant to attract male readers."
5,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is one of the most entertaining ""pop-psychology"" books that I've read. It is filled with anecdotes and stories that illustrate the main point of the book: the emotional side of our brains makes our decisions for us, and the rational side of our brains helps justify our decisions. Sometimes, depending on our rational thoughts can get in the way of making good decisions, and can actually be a detriment. A good example is the physicist who got interested in playing poker professionally. He understood all of the probabilities very well, and did OK in the poker tournaments--up to a certain point. But he could not progress further, until he learned how the emotional side of his brain was needed in poker. Then he became a world-class poker player.The book contains some incredible stories about people who are in imminent danger; an airplane pilot faced with the loss of all hydraulic power in his DC10, a group of firefighters trapped by a wildfire advancing toward them at 30 mph. They stopped rationalizing their situations, and started thinking intuitively, in order to survive.Too much information can impede good judgment. Several psychology studies are described, where a little bit of information leads to a good judgment--say, investing in stocks, or accepting applicants to college--but a lot of information leads to a poor judgment. The reason is that our rational brains are limited by how many pieces of information we can juggle in our minds simultaneously. We find it difficult to consciously sort out which information should be given greater weight in our decisions.Other stories in the book show how people form a world-concept, and then choose to ignore overwhelming evidence that casts doubt on their concept. Sometimes we use the rational side of our brain to justify our disregard of the evidence.This book is an easy, fun read; highly recommended."
6,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,5,"To this day, this is the book I recommend the most. Partly because I pretty much only read fantasy books and that only works for certain (awesome) people, but mostly because this book does such a good job explaining how the brain works that I still remember much of the book today.Think Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, but with much better explanations and less exciting writing.Actually these two books use quite a number of the same studies to make their points, but where Gladwell tends toward obfuscation, How We Decide goes into the science behind how the brain works. After doing some research on Lehrer for this review, apparently he was caught ""self-plagiarizing"" some of his earlier work and fabricating quotes from people like Bob Dylan in his book Imagine, resigned from his position at The New Yorker, and more controversy.I can't really see a point in going further with the review now that I'm not quite sure what to think. I can say, however, that the content is rather similar to Gladwell's Blink if in more depth and that lends itself some credibility with both reaching similar conclusions.Stars to be determined... (i.e., I'm leaving them how I left it)"
7,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642339-lisa-mckenzie,3,"How We Decide opens with a killer first sentence: ""I was flying a Boeing 737 into Tokyo Narita International Airport when the left engine caught on fire."" Right away, I am hooked. As the paragraph progresses, in heart thumping detail, my eyes flick back to the first sentence, to confirm that the author is indeed the pilot on this flight, and not a passenger. Something strikes me as odd. Before reaching the end of the two paragraph opening page, I find myself flipping to the author photo on the back flap of the book. The author looks like a young kid. If I were a bartender, I'd card him. No, in honor of the subject of the book, let me rephrase that; if I were a bartender, I'd decide to card him. As a reader, I decided to scan his credentials; editor at large for Seed magazine. Author of Proust Was a Neuroscientist. Graduate of Columbia University. Rhodes Scholar. Lab worker. Editor. Blogger. How did this kid find the time to also get a pilot's license? I read on. The author is faced with a highly technical life or death decision; should he increase the throttle, or steepen the descent? He decides to gain velocity by faking a nose dive. He writes, ""Immediately, I started to go faster. The problem was that I was headed straight for a suburb in Tokyo."" The next page, the gig is up. Turns out, our author is faking more than the nose dive; the anecdote is a sham. Paragraph seven reveals that our industrious author is recalling his experience in a flight simulator. Which leaves me to wonder, should I trust our narrator, or not? He is picking and choosing which details to share, as every author must, and doing it more skillfully than most. How am I to trust which details reveal a truth about decision making, and which details merely support a virtuoso performance? Esthetically, I am charmed. Intellectually, I am wary. I venture with caution into the first chapter, which questions the Platonic notion that reason must triumph over emotion by declaring that, ""without emotion, reason wouldn't exist at all,"" and supports this assertion with an entertaining, crowd pleasing play by play examples of gut decisions made by NFL quarterbacks. I'm not a football fan, so I still see the puppeteer's strings, but these promptly disappear as I am presented with an anecdote about Antonio Damasio, who is the neurologist version of Brett Favre. Is it geeky to be more taken by neurologists than quarterbacks? Not when you have MS. I digress. Demasio encountered a patient who had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumor in his frontal cortex; while this man's considerable intellect had survived intact, his life had subsequently disintegrated. He was fired from his corporate management position; his businesses failed, his marriage failed, he'd been taken in by a scam, he'd gone bankrupt. What struck Damasio, though, was that the fellow was able to describe his ruination without a trace of emotion. His neutral affect intrigued Damasio, who hooked the guy up to a machine which measures the activity of sweat glands in the palms to quantify emotional response. The man was presented with reliably provocative images; violence, porn, you get the picture. No sweat. The guy was impervious to any emotional provocation. While any of us armchair diagnosticians can easily imagine the man's emotional vacancy was the cause of the disintegration of his marriage, Damasio wondered the damage went further than that; perhaps this man's lack of emotions also led to his failures in the other, supposedly more rational aspects of his life. For there was one intriguing deficit the man complained of; since his surgery, he'd been chronically incapable of making even the smallest decision. We think of decision making as being a rational process, yet it was not this man's intellect that was stripped away, but his emotions; without reference to them, he was unable to choose a restaurant, much less a menu item, and this deficit was proving to be utterly debilitating. Damasio wondered if the emotions play a greater part in decision making than we generally give them credit for.Our author does not leave us with a one note argument for trusting one's emotions in decision making. Instead, he illustrates cases for using one's rational mind as elegantly as he argues the cases for using one's emotional intuition. The key, of course, is to learn how to think about our thinking; to learn to recognize which decisions are best informed by reason, and which by emotion. Many of the experiments presented here were not new to me, but this core thesis promoting metacognition presented a fine uniting principal, and justified the retelling of these stories. By the way, for those of you who would like to hear a surprisingly different take on the crash of United Airlines 232, it's worth viewing disc 3 of Errol Morris' First Person 2000 series. It tells the story of the same incident, from another point of view, designating a different hero and a different decision making process. This is not to say that Morris' perspective detracts from the perspective offered here; it simply serves as a delicious reminder that the facts can serve different masters. I will close by observing that the author, Jonah Lehrer, is a fellow goodreads member. One of his quotes, interestingly enough, is from Jane Austen: ""Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken."" — I imagine, then, that he would encourage you to seek other versions of these stories, as well.

9,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1832493-jeffrey,5,"The brain is our defining organ, giving us not only self-awareness, but also the ability to wonder about ourselves, our world, and our own mortality. It is, nevertheless, a mystery why brains work better than others---why some of us make consistently good decisions, and others never seem to learn from their mistakes.In How We Decide, author Jonah Lehrer explores our current understanding of the human mind. In well-crafted and engaging prose, he draws on examples from professional football players to airline pilots, gambling casinos to modern politics, he demonstrates how different parts of our brain respond to different kinds of stimuli---and how, in a well-trained and adaptable mind, we shift seamlessly between our rational left hemisphere and our emotional and intuitive left side, as we confront the challenges of life. Tightly tightly written and entertaining, How We Decide is intended more for general audiences than academics, who might find its descriptions and explanations too basic to help in their professional work. For the rest of us, however, it is thought-provoking and helpful, bringing us the benefits of modern research without the burden of academic jargon."

I picked it up and read part of a couple chapters.First of all, why would the author, who can put any picture of himself in the entire world (or no picture at all) on the back of his book choose a picture where he is wearing an unzipped hooded sweatshirt? How am I supposed to take this guy seriously? Speaking of decisions, am I right?Second, this book seems to be formulaic pop psychology at its worst. Each chapter opens with an overly dramatic anecdote (plane crash, last minutes of Super Bowl, Deal or No Deal, John Wayne Gacy(!), high-stakes poker) to try to lead into a more abstract concept. Unfortunately, it was really heavy on dramatic anecdote, and really light on abstract concept.It did touch on Kahneman & Tversky's loss aversion concept, an important idea if you are not familiar with it, but honestly, there are 100 other pop psych books that can explain that.

12,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,5,"N.B. September 2013: So apparently this book is a pile of plagiarism (hat tip to Ceridwen for the info). I’m not exactly going to re-read the book so I can rewrite my review in that light. But just be aware of this fact as you read the review below.In my recent review of The Grand Design I went on about my love of science, particularly of physics. I’ll be honest: although biology is really, really cool, I also find it kind of gross. It’s full of squishy stuff, and it was my least favourite of the Holy Trinity of high school science classes (physics, biology, chemistry) for that reason. When I talk biology, I tend to gravitate toward the more abstract areas: genetics, evolutionary biology, and of course, neuroscience—once you get down to the microscopic or molecular levels, the squick factor is considerably reduced. Plus, the brain is just fascinating. It is the undiscovered country of biology: how does consciousness work? What makes us us? The brain is an amazing organ, simultaneously incredibly flexible and resistant yet also so fragile. Even as Jonah Lehrer explores the decision-making process from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, How We Decide also reaffirms my admiration for and awe of the brain.I learned a great deal from this book. Some of it was about football, because Lehrer opens the first chapter with an analysis of Tom Brady’s performance in the 2002 Super Bowl. Football confuses me at the best of times, but fortunately Lehrer includes plenty of other case studies: airplane disasters, debt counselling, basketball performance, etc. How We Decide is definitely a work of popular science, and it seems to be trying to appeal to the broadest audience possible. However, I approached it as someone interested in learning about neuroscience, and in this respect the book did not let me down.The focus of How We Decide, especially in the early chapters, is on the distinction between rational decision-making and emotional decision-making. Lehrer challenges the myth that humans are “rational animals”, that our rationality sets us apart and allows us to tame unreliable emotion. His counterexample is the stunning account of people who have experienced damage to their orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This little area of the prefrontal cortex (itself important to the process of decision-making) has a huge impact on how we decide: it is “responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process”, and lacking it means one essentially decides based on rational criteria alone. If the myth of our rationality were true, this would result in the ultimate decision maker, completely unswayed by appeals to emotion. Instead, people with damaged or removed OFCs are indecisive: without emotional cues, they are left to analyze even the smallest decision with relentless attention to the pros and the cons. Emotion might sometimes cloud our judgement, but it can also play a vital role in impelling us.Later, Lehrer looks at the converse, where emotion misleads one’s decision-making process. He uses high-stakes situations, such as playing Deal or No Deal, to illustrate that emotion can prevent us from choosing the better settlement. When we’re angry or feel that our pride is on the line, we can be rash, leading us to reject otherwise fair offers. Credit cards and other abstractions of money make it easier to spend money, because our emotional brain is fooled into thinking we aren’t spending all that much money at all. (Lehrer attributes the subprime mortgage bubble to this kind of thinking, and points out that this is how credit card companies sucker us in to high lifetime interest rates by using low introductory offers. If you can only take away a single piece of advice from How We Decide, try this: “read only the fine print.”)In fact, what begins to emerge from these chapters on rationality versus emotion is a theory of automatic versus deliberative decision-making. For situations that are familiar to us, it’s best to keep autopilot on and let our unconscious do the thinking. Our brain is used to the situation, and thinking through the steps is more likely to screw us up than help (this is where Lehrer’s sports examples make a lot of sense). However, as will come to no surprise to most of us, our automatic brains are very bad at dealing with unexpected information. In particular, most people’s automatic brains suck at math. This is where rationality and a more thoughtful decision-making process becomes essential: we have to analyze the new information and figure out how to incorporate it into our model before we can proceed. If we do not, we might end up rejecting a deal that is much more lucrative than what any of the remaining briefcases might offer.All this might sound rather obvious so far (if so, congratulations on your smartitude), and you might be thinking, but what about the science behind these conclusions? Well, it’s there, but it’s so well integrated into the book that if I start trying to tease it out and present it for our mutual amusement, I’ll probably just end up making it sound dry and boring. Suffice it to say, the second chapter is called “The Predictions of Dopamine”, and Lehrer goes into great detail through the book about the roles various sections of the brain play in decision-making, as well as how we know this—mostly fMRIs, sometimes monkey torture. And of course, it’s worth keeping in mind that none of this is as simple as Lehrer makes it out to be, and that there are probably alternative explanations—e.g., game theory, evolutionary psychology, etc. Lehrer occasionally makes reference to these, but for the most part he sticks with a very functional exploration of our brain. And that’s fine; if I want to read different perspectives, I can always seek out books on those particular topics.In the spirit of this book’s subject matter, I’ll acknowledge a bias in my decision to like this book. How We Decide lends support to a lot of positions I personally endorse. For example, Lehrer points out that, “people with a genetic mutation that reduces the number of dopamine receptors in the ACC [anterior cingulate cortex] … are significantly more likely to become addicted to drugs and alcohol”. This belies the contention that addiction is a choice rather than a disease and that addicts simply lack sufficient “willpower” to improve their lives. I’m not saying that we should just drug everyone based on his or her neurological profile—but certainly understanding biological factors that influence our tendencies can help us combat negative tendencies, such as addiction. (Lehrer and I also share a mild disdain for economics and attempts to play the stock market like it’s a predictable phenomenon.)If there is a theme to How We Decide, it’s that we often suck at making decisions. Not only do we have numerous biases left over from evolutionary adaptation and social inculcation, but the complex interplay between conscious and unconscious decision-making means sometimes we relegate decisions to a part of our brain that isn’t particularly suited to them. Lehrer’s theme, however, is that not all is hopeless: by being aware of these biases, by thinking about how we think, we can mitigate them and improve our ability to make decisions. It turns out that how we decide is influenced a great deal by thinking about how we decide.And so that’s why I loved this book. It is an excellent scientific look at decision-making through both anecdotal and empirical evidence. (The former is, of course, worthless in a court of science but invaluable in the court of opinion.) Moreover, How We Decide is useful, offering salient advice about how to improve one’s ability to make decisions. I don’t doubt that many people will dislike this book, or at least Lehrer’s style or his derision for economics, but I do highly recommend you give it a try.

Such a mythical society- a republic of pure reason- has been dreamed of by philosophers ever since. But this classical theory is founded upon a crucial mistake. For too long, people have disparaged the emotional brain, blaming our feelings for all of our mistakes. The truth is far more interesting. What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren’t for our emotions, reason wouldn’t exist at all.” Lehrer goes on to detail the intricate way we make decisions, and it is fascinating, a wonderful, elegant, surprising read. It is a hot button topic, and when brought up with friends, everyone has their own examples of making a decision, with which tools they used, emotion or reason, and the consequences, and they believed passionately in the outcome as proof as to whether it was a good or bad decision. I tend to subscribe to the more Zen like view that no decision is inherently good or bad, but what had to happen in the way it did, so that even bad decisions lead you where you are supposed to be. As Mason Jennings sings, “…where would I be right now if all my dreams had come true… I would have never seen your face, this world would be a different place.” Not to spoil the gist of it all, but Lehrer ends with a wonderful conclusion; that thinking about how you make decisions is more important whether you go with reason or with emotion.
 “If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision, be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. It doesn’t matter if you’re choosing between wide receivers or political candidates. You might be playing poker or assessing the results of a television focus group. The best way to make sure you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head.”
Lehrer seriously leaves no stone unturned in his vast perusal of the literature of neurology and cognitive psychology, and he makes learning so deliciously fun, I wish he was a teacher, but am not sure if I want him to have been my high school or college teacher. Didja know, “a typical major league pitch takes about .35 seconds to travel from the hand of the pitcher to home base. (This is the average interval between human heartbeats.)Unfortunately for the batter, it takes about .25 seconds for his muscles to initiate a swing, leaving his brain a paltry one-tenth of a second to make up its mind on whether or not to do so. But even this estimate is too generous. It takes a few milliseconds for the visual information to travel from the retina to the visual cortex, so the batter really has fewer than five milliseconds to decide if he should swing. But people can’t think this quickly, even under perfect conditions, it takes the brain about twenty milliseconds to respond to a sensory stimulus.”So I have never been at the receiving end of a major league fastball, so I imagine I had more time to decide when I played softball, or when I hit a tennis ball, but I get that it is all happening in seconds, and it is not the rational part of my brain working, it is instinct, and it is feeling that guides me. Lehrer spends a bit of time on Tom Brady’s decision making in the pocket, with high pressure and again milliseconds to decide where to throw, when and to whom. “There is no robot that can hit a baseball or throw a football or ride a bicycle…This is why when evolution was building a brain, it didn’t bother to replace all of those emotional processes with new operations under explicit, conscious control. The result is that the uniquely human areas of the mind depend on the primitive mind underneath. The process of thinking requires feeling, for feelings are what let us understand all the information that we can’t directly comprehend. Reason without emotion is impotent.” There is an interesting example of a British submarine commander who was watching radar and something was just slightly off, slightly different than a normal blip on radar that he had been watching and he had a minute or less to decide whether he should give the command to fire on the blip or not. When his decision, which was the right one, was studied by other military personnel, they could discern no disruption of the pattern, and chalked it all up to luck. The commander himself could not describe what felt different or wrong to him either, but when a psychologist took a broader view, he was able to find a 3 second discrepancy, enough to give the commander chills, enough to make him decide to shoot it down, and save an entire American battleship and not kill 2 American pilots. That kind of instinct is elegant and beautiful, and accurate over and over.Oh, if we could have learned this in school: “The brain is designed to amplify the shock of mistaken predictions. Whenever it experiences something unexpected- like a radar blip that doesn’t fit the usual pattern- the cortex immediately takes notice. Nothing focuses the mind like surprise. This fast cellular process begins in a tiny area in the center of the brain that is dense with dopamine neurons. Neuroscientists have known for several years that his region, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the detection of errors. The signal emanates from the ACC, so many neuroscientists refer to this area as the “oh, shit!” circuit.”When there is a genetic mutation present that causes decreased dopamine receptors in the ACC, researchers have found fascinating correlations with drug and alcohol dependency, for example. The signals that alert the brain that something bad has happened, a negative reinforce, can’t allow the brain to learn from it, or alter its self destructive path. The signals travel along ‘spindle neurons’ that carry emotions through the whole brain. Only humans and great apes have spindle neurons. Lehrer writes, “we can now begin to understand the surprising wisdom of our emotions. The activity of dopamine neurons demonstrates that feelings are simply reflections of hard wired animal instincts. Human emotions are rooted in the predictions of highly flexible brain cells, which are constantly adjusting thief connections to reflect reality. Every time you make a mistake or encounter something new, your brain cells are busy changing themselves. Our emotions are deeply empirical…Every time you experience a feeling of joy or disappoint men, fear or happiness, your neurons are busy rewiring themselves, constructing a theory of what sensory cues preceded the emotions. The lesson is then committed to memory, so the next time you make a decision, your brain cells are ready. ”I recently discovered a brain training memory game based on the Stroop task, which is a psychological experience of flashing colored words of different colors, and the task is to ignore the word and focus on the color and pick the color over the word. So the word blue in green needs to be read as green, and it is hard to tell your brain that. It instinctively wants to pick blue since that is the word you are looking at. When looked at through MRI, the prefrontal cortex, home of reason, is the most active during this exercise. I am good at this exercise, which is interesting since I think I rely on my emotional brain more than my rational brain when it comes to decisions. So exercising my prefrontal cortex will come in handy. It’s fun too! Another fascinating example involved an airplane flight with a completely unprecedented and never before though of system failure that required the pilot to invent, invent!, a new way of flying midflight. The prefrontal cortex is also capable of coming up with unique and creative solutions or flashes of insight, which feel more instinctual or emotion based, but is an elegant synthesis of the two. And perhaps my favorite idea in the whole book: “moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ in the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the ethics of evolution into a straightforward legal system.”  Research and imaging of the brain as they confront ethical dilemmas such as a train speeding down the track reveals intricate reasoning and feeling; the easy choice is to flick a switch to save five men versus one, but the brain struggles if the choice is to push an overweight man onto the track to save the same five men. Our psychological evolution, separate from the bleak Darwinian view of ‘amorality and selfish genes,’ is richer and more integral to the wiring of our brain that we ever knew. Beautiful. "
14,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,2,"I was excited for How We Decide. Lehrer supposedly took my position, that human beings are both rational and irrational, both are important to good decision making, and they are highly interrelated. Who doesn’t like having their deeply held beliefs about the human condition validated by science? But, though Lehrer did plumb some of the rational/emotional divide, his book became more of a series of scientific anecdotes and sweeping generalizations than a proper synthesis of neuroscience. The anecdotes are sharp, crossing popular topics like sports and the stock market, and in proper media man fashion, Lehrer takes us into the personal details of people who were present. That’s one thing that makes his New Yorker writing so compulsively readable. Unfortunately here, with several hundred pages in which to illuminate the mind, he seems to have missed the scope.In his opening, Lehrer relays the story of Tom Brady, the rookie quarterback who led his team to a Superbowl upset victory. Lehrer uses Brady as an example of how going on feeling leads to sports success. But a few chapters later, Lehrer uses the 76ers basketball team as an example of how feelings distort how well we’re doing. The 76ers help illustrate contemporary scientific theories on dopamine, but it’s not as though Brady wasn’t affected by the chemical. A few chapters in you realize that like a lot of neuroscience books, this one is just going to represent the same things we already know (sometimes feeling is good, sometimes bad; sometimes logic takes over) in some novel scientific terms. By way of sweeping generalization and chapters contradicting each other, it fails to synthesize neuroscience by avoiding context as to why things sometimes succeed, fail or come into conflict. In that sense, it’s a longer and not quite as exact explanation of the brain as Stephen Johnson’s Mind Wide Open.The worst sweeping generalization is Lehrer’s conflation of intuition, gut reaction and emotion. You can argue that intuition and gut feelings are emotions – but they are not all of the emotions. Love, hate and fear are not the same as unconscious intuition. So when he discusses the popular game show, Deal or No Deal, and bounces between chastising players for relying too much on emotion, he’s only partially right. Watch the show and you see people caving in to fear about low prize amounts, pleas from family to do one thing or another, and emotional assurances from the host. But when Lehrer implies they lose money on the show for relying on intuition, he’s ignoring what actually happens. Your emotions relating directly to an event, emotions reflecting possible outcomes in the future, and reflective emotions about how things will feel in the future, are not the same. Lehrer covers so much ground, from game shows to sports to politics, that you’re bound to know one example well enough to catch him oversimplifying. It’s the ironic problem of writing for such a broad audience. Take his analysis of the chaotic stock market. Lehrer claims that if investors see the market climbing and have successful returns, they’ll believe they’ve “solved the market.” Doubtless some people do delude themselves into thinking they’ve got the whole system figured out. But in reality many investors seek out corroboration - if you see precious metal commodities rising and find corroborating stimuli like positive feedback from your broker or a news story of strife where the metals are mined, you have probably figured out one blip in the market. Attempted interpretations like that can still be faulty, but the market responses aren’t purely random, and the individuals that chase them to do not necessarily believe they’ve figured out the entire trading cycle. Lehrer cites a study in which investors partook in a mock-market that was secretly based on the world’s worst crashes – but the study made it impossible for mock-investors to find data, causes or even gossip for why these models were shifting. It does tell us something about how people will interpret unexplained series of numbers, but also tells us something about how some scientists will oversimplify human behavior. How We Decide has dozens of entertaining anecdotes. It’s no surprise that Lehrer has been on The New Yorker’s staff before; he’s got the knack for germane-sounding tidbits. But like fellow New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell, he seems equally prone to overgeneralizing his subjects in the throes of enthusiasm. He makes the pop science entertaining, but I can’t recommend it as a resource."
15,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"A look at the existing literature on behavioral science and the conclusions it makes about how we make decisions; specifically, the book argues that we do not simply decide rationally. Rather, we use a blend of emotion, gut feeling, or instinct, as well as a rational weighing of pros and cons, when we decide. Or at least, we should. (The experimental literature is especially fascinating here, as for example in the man who has a brain injury that leaves him affectless and unmoved by emotion, and thus unable to make even the simplest decision, as he gets caught up in an endless loop of weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each possibility.) Snap decisions based on observation and instinct, Lehrer shows in countless examples, are often better (as in successfully crash-landing a plane or escaping a forest fire) than simply listening to one’s desires (as those trapped in credit card debt know too well). On the other hand, as Lehrer shows from examples in the fields of sports and art, over-thinking a mistake or a challenge can lead to perpetual self-doubt and undoing. The crucial point is that deciders must analyze their own decisions and watch carefully how much emotion is biasing their choices; we “know more than we think we know,” and if we apply reason to that knowledge, we can make efficient decisions.This isn’t a particularly weighty or earth-shaking conclusion, and much of the material here can be found in other popular books on neuroscience. I recognized the hot hands study, the story of the firefighter who built a burnt patch to save himself, and several others. Instead of providing further insight on or alternative interpretations of these studies, Lehrer repeats their key points in such a way that they relate to his larger claims about decision making. I also learned, just before finishing this book, that Lehrer is the disgraced journalist who manufactured Bob Dylan quotes for a subsequent book. So, caveat lector, I suppose. Those problematic aspects aside, I very much enjoyed this book, with its wealth of fascinating anecdotes from brain studies and its practical, sensible applications of the studies to advice on how to decide. Lehrer’s style is breezy and accessible, and he has a gift for finding the empathy, suspense, and drama in every human story. "
16,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,3,"As per Goodreads community reviews, this book (""The Decisive Moment: How The Brain Makes Up Its Mind"") is an act of self-plagiarism (from ""How We Decide""? or is it the same book?), and it also contains plenty of misquoted data. In this light, I probably should have started my adventure with neuroscience with Kahneman instead. Nevertheless, I have learnt some new things about the workings of the brain, even though it did not feel like a very engaging introduction to me. I found it hard to relate to some of the examples used (like a game of American football or owning eight credit cards). The narrative is quite often needlessly repetitive."

Reason without emotion is impotent.Every time you make a mistake or encounter something new, your brain cells are busy changing themselves. Our emotions are deeply empirical.When Schultz studied those juice-craving monkeys, he discovered that it took only a few experimental trials before the monkey's neurons knew exactly when to expect their rewards. The neurons did this by continually incorporating the new information, turning a negative feeling into a teachable moment. If the juice didn't arrive, then the dopamine cells adjusted their expectations. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on your dopamine neurons.On why you should fail often:When the mind is denied the emotional sting of losing, it never figures out how to win.Even when we think we know nothing, our brains know something. That's what our feelings are trying to tell us.According to Robertie, the most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. In other words, you need to consciously consider the errors being internalized by your dopamine neurons. After Robertie plays a chess match, or a poker hand, or a backgammon game, he painstakingly reviews what happened.[...]He knows that self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as ""a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.""Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence (being smart). Dweck has shown that this type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads the students to see mistakes as a sign of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn.Kids praised for their hard work were more interested in the higher-scoring exams. They wanted to understand their mistakes, to learn from their errors, to figure out how to do better.The experience of failure had been so discouraging for the ""smart"" kids that they actually regressed.""I'm looking really hard for my mistakes. I pretty much always want to find 30 mistakes, 30 things that I could have done better. If I can't find 30, then I'm not looking hard enough."" - - Herb Stein (TV shows)A player who thinks he has a hot hand has a distorted sense of his own talent, which leads him to take riskier shots, since he assumes his streak will save him (overconfidence). Of course, the player is also more likely to miss these riskier shots. According Tversky and Gilovich, the best shooters always think they're cold. When their feelings tell them to take the shots because they've got the hot hands, they don't listen.""People enjoy investing in the market and gambling in a casino for the same reason that they see Snoopy in the clouds. When the brain is exposed to anything random, like a slot machine or the shape of a cloud, it automatically imposes a pattern onto the noise. But that isn't Snoopy, and you haven't found the secret pattern in the stock market."" - Read Montague (neuroscientist)Since the market is a random walk with an upward slope, the best solution is to pick a low-cost index fund and wait. Patiently. Don't fixacte on what might have been or obsess over someone else's profits. The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio - who doesn't buy or sell a single stock - outperforms the average ""active"" investor by nearly 10%.The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand.On credit cards:""I always ask people, 'Would you have bought the item if you had to pay cash? If you had to go to an ATM and feel the money in your hands and then hand it over?' Most of the time, they think about it for a minute and they say no.""- Herman Palmer (financial counselor)When you buy something with cash, the purchase involves an actual loss - your wallet is literally lighter. Credit cards, however, make the transaction abstract, so that you don't really feel the downside of spending money. Brain-imaging experiments suggest that paying with credit cards actually reduces activity in the insula, a brain region associated with negative feelings.Our emotional brain wants to max out the credit card, order dessert, and smoke a cigarette. When it sees something it wants, it has difficulty waiting to get it. The emotional brains is routinely duped by these tempting (but financially foolish) advertisements. ""I always tell people to read ONLY the fine print. The bigger the print, the less it matters.""Because the emotional parts of the brain reliably undervalue the future - life is short and we want pleasure now - we all end up spending too much money today and delaying saving until tomorrow (and tomorrow and tomorrow).This human foible is known as the framing effect, and it's a byproduct of loss aversion. The effect helps explain why people are much more likely to buy meat when it's labeled 85% lean instead of 15% fat. And why twice as many patients opt for sugery when told there's 80% chance of their surviving instead of a 20% chande of their dying.How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surpisingly simple: thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense - if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example - then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain. (stoicism)Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. ""Anyone can become angry - that is easy,"" Aristotle wrote. ""But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not easy."" That requires some thought. The rational brain can't silence emotions, but it can help figure out which ones should be followed.There was a strong correlation between the behavior of the four-year-old waiting for a marshmallow and that child's future behavior as a young adult. The children who rang the bell within a minute were much more likely to have behavioral problems later on. They got worse grades and were more likely to do drugs. They struggled in stressful situations and had short tempers. Their SAT scores were, on average, 210 points lower than those of kids who'd waited several minutes before ringing the bell. In fact, the marshmallow test turned out to be a better predictor of SAT results than the IQ tests given to the four-year-olds.[...] patient children were better at using reason to control their impulses. They were the kids who covered their eyes, or looked in the other direction, or managed to shift their attention to something other than the delicious marshmallow sitting right there.It turned out that the same cognitive skills that allowed these kids to thwart temptation also allowed them to spend more time on their homework. In both situations, the prefrontal cortex was forced to exercise its cortical authority and inhibit the impulses that got in the way of the goal.Jung-Beeman found that the mind was carefully preparing itself for the epiphany; every successful insight was preceded by the same sequence of cortical events. He likes to quote Louis Pasteur: ""Chance favors the prepared mind.""From the perspective of the brain, new ideas are merely several old thoughts that occur at the exact same time.Unless you are disciplined about what you choose to think about you won't be able to effectively think through your problem. You'll be so overwhelmed by all those incoming ideas that you'll never be able to figure out which ones are genuine insights.What causes choking? Although it might seem like an amorphous category of failure, or even a case of excess emotion, choking is actually triggered by a specific mental mistake: THINKING TOO MUCH. The sequence of events typically goes like this: When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn't make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. Fleming (opera star) started to think about aspects of singing that she hadn't thought about since she was a beginner, such as where to position her tongue and how to shape her mouth for different pitches. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The opera singer forgets how to sing. The pitcher concentrates too much on his motion and loses the control of his fastball. The actor gets anxious about his lines and seizes up onstage. In each of these instances, the natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears. [...] novice putters hit better shots when they consciously reflect on their actions. The more time the beginner spends thinking about the putt, the more likely he is to sink the ball in the hole. By concentrating on the golf game, by paying attention to the mechanics of the stroke, the novice can avoid beginners' mistakes.A little experience, however, changes everything. After a golfer has learned how to putt - once he or she has memorized the necessary movements - analyzing the stroke is a waste of time. The brain already knows what to do. [...] when experienced golfers are forced to think about their putts, they hit significantly WORSE shots.When you are at a high level, your skills become somewhat automated. You don't need to pay attention to every step in what you're doing.Experienced golfers should focus on general aspects of their intended movement, what psychologists call a holistic cue word. For instance, instead of contemplating something like the precise position of the wrist or elbow, the player should focus on a descriptive adjective, such as SMOOTH or BALANCED.While reason is a powerful cognitive tool, it's dangerous to rely exclusively on the deliberations of the prefrontal cortex. When the rational brain hijacks the mind, people tend to make all sorts of decision-making mistakes. They hit bad golf shots and choose wrong answers on standardized tests. They ignore the wisdom of their emotions - the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons - and start reaching for things that they can't explain. Instead of going with the option that feels the best, a person starts going with the option that SOUNDS the best, even if it's a very bad idea.A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40% more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute.Consumers typically suffer from a version of the placebo effect. Since they EXPECT cheaper goods to be less effective, they generally ARE less effective, even if the goods are identical to more expensive products. This is why brand-name aspirin works better than generic aspirin and why Coke tastes better than cheaper colas, even if most consumers can't tell the difference in blind taste test.Only one brain region seemed to respond to the PRICE of the wine rather than the wine itself: the prefrontal cortex. In general, more expensive wines made parts of the prefrontal cortex more excited. We don't realize how powerful our expectations are. They can really modulate every aspect of our experience. And if our expectations are based on false assumptions - like the assumption that more expensive wine tastes better - they can be very misleading.In many circumstances, we could make better consumer decisions by knowing LESS about the products we are buying.The prefrontal cortex isn't good at picking out jams or energy drinks or bottles of wine. Such decisions are like a golf swing: they are best done with the emotional brain, which generates its verdict automatically.The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two. The conscious brain can only handle about seven pieces of data at any moment.Distracting the brain with a challenging memory task made a person much more likely to give in to temptation and choose that calorie-dense dessert. [...] the effort required to memorize seven digits drew cognitive resources away from the part of the brain that normally controls emotional urges. Because working memory and rationality share a common cortical source - the prefrontal cortex - a mind trying to remember lots of information is less able to exert control over its impulses. The substrate of reason is so limited that a few extra digits can become an extreme handicap.[...] why we get cranky when we're hungry and tired: the brain is less able to suppress the negative emotions sparked by small annoyances. A bad mood is really just a rundown prefrontal cortex.This is known as the anchoring effect, since a meaningless anchor - in this case, a random number - can have strong impact on subsequent decisions. Consider the price tags in a car dealership. Nobody actually pays the prices listed in bold black ink on the windows. The inflated sticker is merely an anchor that allows the car salesperson to make the real price of the car seem like a better deal. When a person is offered the inevitable discount, the prefrontal cortex is convinced that the car is a bargain.The fragility of the prefrontal cortex means that we all have to be extremely vigilant about not paying attention to unnecessary information. The anchoring effect demonstrates how a single additional fact can systematically distort the reasoning process. Instead of focusing on the important variable - how much is that cordless keyboard really worth? - we get distracted by some meaningless numbers. And then we spend too much money.We live in a culture that's awash in information; it's the age of Google, cable news, and free online encyclopedias. We get anxious whenever we get cut off from all this knowledge, as if it's impossible for anyone to make a decision without a search engine. But this abundance comes with some hidden costs. The main problem is that the human brain wasn't designed to deal with such as surfeit of data. As a results, we are constantly exceeding the capacity of our prefrontal cortices, feeding them more facts and figures than they can handle.""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" - Herbert SimonWhen making decisions, people almost always assume that more information is better. [...] But it's important to know the limitations of this approach, which are rooted in the limitations of the brain. The prefrontal cortex can only handle so much information at any one time, so when a person gives it too many facts then asks it to make a decision based on the facts that SEEM important, that person is asking for trouble. He is going to buy the wrong items at Wal-Mart and pick the wrong stocks.It's amazing how perfectly intelligent people will make foolish decisions if you give them lots of irrelevant stuff to consider.How we decide should depend on what we are deciding.While the anatomy of evil remains incomplete, neuroscientists are beginning to identify the specific deficits that define the psychopatic brain. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, a brain area responsible for propagating aversive emotions such as fear and anxiety. As a result, psychopats never feel bad when they make other people feel bad. Aggression doesn't make them nervous. Terror isn't terrifying.""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason.""- G.K Chesterton""Moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment. When you see a painting, you usually know instantly and automatically whether you like it. If someone asks you to explain your judgment, you confabulate ... Moral arguments are much the same: two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first, and their reasons are invented on the fly, to throw at each other.""- Jonathan Haidt ""So convenient a thing is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.""One of the ways neuroscientists learn about the brain is by studying what happens when something goes wrong with it. For example, scientists learned about the importance of our moral emotions by studying psychopats.The broken mind helps us understand how the normal mind works.Whenever you see a human face, you use a highly specialized brain region called the fusiform face area that is solely devoted to helping you recognize other people. In contrast, when you look at a chair, the brain relies on the inferior temporal gyrus, an area activated by any sort of complex visual scene. However, in the study, people with autism never turned on the fusiform face area. They looked at human faces with the part of the brain that normally recognizes objects. A person was just another thing. A face generated no more emotion than a chair.Once people become socially isolated, they stop stimulating the feelings of other people. Their moral intuitions are never tuned on. As a result, the inner Machiavelli takes over, and the sense of sympathy is squashed by selfhishness. The UC Berkeley psychologist Dacher Keltner has found that in many social situations, people with power act just like patients with damage to the emotional brain. ""The experience of power might be thought of as having someone open your skull and take out that part of your brain so critical to empathy and socially appropriate behavior. You become very impulsive and insensitive, which is a bad situation.""Accroing to Slovic, the problem with statistics is that they don't activate our moral emotions. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can't comprehend suffering on such as massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Theresa put it, ""If I look at the mass, I will never act.

The author is wearing a hoodie in his picture (he better like drinking beer).What I didn't like: The use of monkeys in experiments. Super sad!Who I'd suggest it to: Anyone who likes pretending they are a psychologist. This will add more ammunition to the psychological gun.

21,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1626845-kyle,1,"I'm going to start this review by saying I did not read the entire book. I read about 2 chapters and had to turn the book off (I was listening on my commute.) Approaching the book with sincere optimism at reading a solid non-fictional psychology based book about choices, I felt I was baited and switched. While this book proclaimed scientific non-fiction, and painted itself as objective, I simply could not get over the fact that the author was very clearly pushing a big-bang, darwin-inspired, godless agenda. I felt that there was a sense of scientific self-righteousness about the author that I would not be able to deal with throughout an entire book. No qualms were had in denying years of traditional psychology by applealing to arguments of neuroscience (a prepubescent science even in comparision to the often rejected non-science of psychology), and in doing so all arguments were made with a ""survival of the fittest makes it obvious"" tone. The text was laced with biased, unproven-scientific rhetoric that I felt detracted from the arguments that could have been quite interesting if portrayed in a more approchable way. In the end, I don't recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn neuroscience or psychology objectively... including myself. "
22,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,3,"With Blink, The Tipping Point, and Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell has cornered the market on popular studies of human behavior. But Jonah Lehrer's How We Decide holds its own with Gladwell, Stephen Pinker, Daniel Dennett, and the host of science writers increasingly focused on the complexities of the human brain. ""There isn't any spectacular revelation, unique viewpoint or knockout final summation,"" noted the San Francisco Chronicle, and the Washington Post felt that Lehrer ""does little to integrate science's contradictory findings."" Lehrer nonetheless illuminates the many processes involved in even the simplest decisions. By letting the experts do much of the talking and by drawing conclusions from his voluminous research and knowledge of the field, Lehrer presents a readable account of what we know about how we decide -- and acknowledges the vast universe of what we don't.This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
23,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31310-charlie,4,"I have read three books that circle around the science of decision-making, especially under pressure. The most famous is BLINK; but I also grabbed on a whim a book called THE UNTHINKABLE about how people have survived extreme circumstances (such as plane crashes and acts of terrorism)... finally, on a recommendation, I read HOW WE DECIDE. They all are informed in one way or another by the new discoveries of neuroscience about how the brain work, and use the same case study techniques of FREAKONOMICS - in other words, are pretty easy reads.Let me make this very very clear - the ONLY book worth reading - the only one which is cohesive; that is engaging; that you can actually learn something from is this one - HOW WE DECIDE. I especially say that in light of the KoolAid like hype about everything Malcolm Gladwell writes and especially BLINK, with which I was greatly disappointed. I was immensely stimulated with HOW WE DECIDE and highly recommend it as a light introduction to a Big Subject that I am sure we will be hearing a lot more about in the future. "
24,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122582-taylor,3,"I think I have to stop reading (listening to) these kinds of books (i.e. books in which an author uses psychological/neurological/behavioral economics research to explain how humans do something -- decide, pay attention, seek happiness, etc.). This one follows a similar pattern as the rest of them, discussing a lot of the same classic and newer experiments, then trying to relate the results to how we make decisions. While that part has gotten repetitive for me, the author does come to some feasible, applicable conclusions about how we decide and how we can decide better (hint: ""rational"" decision-making is definitely not always best...though neither is emotional/intuitive). I liked how it was organized, too: engaging stories about real people (quarterbacks, elite poker players, firefighters, serial killers) making surprising/money-making/life-saving/(life-ending) decisions introduced each section.So -- 3 stars if you've obsessively read books like this for the last year or two, like I have; 4 if it's a new genre."
25,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,1,"Jonah Lehrer's books have been pulled from stores due to plagiarism and fake interviews. I recommend Malcolm Gladwell's books as an alternative.For the most part, this book is a brilliantly simple explanation of complex mental processes, but in some cases Lehrer oversimplifies a bit.The book explains when to make decisions using your rational versus emotional mind. For new or simple problems, rely upon reason; for complex or habituated problems, rely upon emotion (with the caveat that relying too heavily upon emotion in such situations will prevent you from changing your opinion when presented with contradictory evidence).To clarify these points and make them memorable, Lehrer uses several engaging mini-biographies interwoven with the evidence of various popular psychological and neurological studies."
26,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,4,"It’s my first look inside the brain and I liked what I saw. 'How we Decide' looks at the new science of decision-making and how it can help us in making better choices in our daily lives. Jonah Lehrer shows us the inner workings of the brain. We learn about the different parts of the brain which are involved in the decision-making process, chiefly among them the prefrontal cortex. He explains beautifully about loss aversion, creativity and working memory. I really liked the description of new ideas: “From the perspective of the brain, new ideas are merely several old thoughts that occur at the exact same time.”This book has really encouraged me to explore the human brain further."
27,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889660-barbara,1,"I gave this book five stars, which I now withdraw because the author's credibility as a science writer has recently been destroyed and respectable outlets like The New Yorker and Wired will no longer publish his work. His publisher has withdrawn his most recent book from sale.I had struggled to assimilate the new, counter-intuitive research results Jonah Lehrer reported in the field of decision-making and now I am attempting to unlearn them as my confidence in his honesty has been destroyed along with his career as a youthful popstar of neuroscience reporting."

29,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,5,"Loy Machedo’s Book Review – How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer. My journey into the world of the Grey Matter started with Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink and then moved into Freewill by Sam Harris, The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, Predictably Irrational by Dan Airely, Quiet by Susan Cain, Incognito by David Eagleman and Emotional Intelligence by Travis Bradberry. And when I thought I knew a little bit, in comes 27 year old Author - Jonah Lehrer with his Mind-Boggling Contribution to the world of Neuroscience, Psychology and Behavioral Science titled How We Decide. In this truly engaging Masterpiece, Lehrer goes right into the mysterious inner workings of the brain. You will get introduced to many terminologies & parts of the Brain like the Nucleus Accumbens, Spindle Cells, The Prefrontal Cortex, Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Thalamus, Amygdala and the functions of hormones like oxytocin and dopamine. Now at first this may sound scary and confusing. But the manner in which Jonah explains it, makes it all the way more intriguing and fascinating to study and learn more. The examples provided in the book to support each and every theory of his is also pretty baffling. He uses anecdotes like:1.	Tom Brady’s memorable pass in the 2002 Super Bowl; 2.	How Michael Binger , a Stanford particle physicist nearly won the World Series of Poker; 3.	Captain Al Haynes of United Air Lines, who made a unbelievable crash landing of a jetliner whose hydraulic system had failed entirely;4.	How in the most mysterious & unexplainable manner Lt. Cmdr. Michael Riley used his intuition and saved thousands of lives by giving the orders to shoot down an enemy missile - even though no one could identify it – even on the radar. 5.	Stanford Psych Research Carol Dweck famous tests on 10 year olds and what difference they showed in their performance simply by using words like “being smart” versus “trying hard”.6.	How Ann Klinestiver had a total personality change from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde simply because of strong doses of Requip – a Dopamine Agonist. Lehrer also, though the use of technology & fMRI scans also proves various thought-provoking facts like:1.	Why overly emotional decision will likely lead us into trouble2.	Why are some people addicted to gambling. 3.	Why working in Wall-Street it totally irrational4.	How Credit Cards make you spend more5.	Purpose of Meta-Cognition and its importance6.	Why we shouldn’t think too much7.	What does Introspection have to do with the Placebo Effect8.	The fact that too much information is a bad thing9.	Why we make the wrong decisions if we explain what we doThroughout the book you get faint glimpses of the past, present and future. Philosophers like Plato, Descartes who promulgated that pure reason was the best form to decide everything And then scholars like Soren Kierkegaard who later on acknowledged the presence & importance of the cognitive dimension to emotion; To finally in the presence of Jonah Lehrer who goes a step further into the unfathomable depths of the thinking, feeling and decision making process. You begin to realize that may be there is still a lot more to be discovered – and a lot to more to be surprised with. Finally, towards the end of the book, Lehrer fuses his findings with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy – which is the process of interrogating your emotional response and how emotions influence reason. So what is my Overall VerdictThis is not a book you can read just once. The wealth of knowledge and information in it is without a doubt unimaginable. Once you complete reading it, you begin to wonder, if this young author of 27 years of age knows so much but claims there is yet so much more to learn – where does it ever end? Can we limit our understanding of life by just one single book? Or single discipline? Or single group thinking? Let me warn you - This is seriously a book that will either impress you or scare you away. In either case, it is a book that will leaves its impact. In my case, I have become ardent fan of Jonah Lehrer work. And will earnestly seek ways and means to read and educate myself with everything he has to offer. This book is without a doubt a Thought-Provoking Landmark Masterpiece. Overall ScoreAnd a Book that scores a Perfect 10 out of 10.  Loy Machedoloymachedo.com"
30,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6067065-bela,4,"I have always had an interest in understanding how the human mind works, so when I saw this book at the airport, I had to pick it up. After all, what else was I going to do on a five hour plan ride from Orlando to LA? This book definitely does not have a story. It's more of a hybrid between a psychology text book and real life case studies. Lehrer relates decision making to things that ""normal"" people are interested in, like sports, poker, wine, food, etc, and I think that is what makes this a page-turner. There are so many things about the human mind that fascinate me, but the what fascinates me the most is its ability to adapt. How else do you think evolution happened? The brain learned that it didn't need certain body parts and needed other ones and after an extremely long period of changes, here we are, the human being. I was watching a documentary about the first year of a child's life and how helpless the human baby is compared to any other mammal infant. But it is because of this helpless state, the brain is able to absorb so many different things, like language, how to interact with others, and to think rationally and emotionally at the same time. This is what makes us human. Lehrer tries to explain that emotions are actually a good thing (how many times does your significant other tell you you're being ""too"" emotional? - tell him to read this book!). Emotions combined with rational thinking leads to the best decisions. He also explains phenomenons like that feeling is when you just know something is right, and why it's okay you don't know why you feel that way. Sometimes it's better not to think about things to much: for example, there was a study done to test flavors of jam. When people were asked to pick the one the liked the best, the pick Brand A, but when they were asked to pick the brand they liked the best and WHY they liked it the best, they ended up picking a completely different brand. Sometimes it's better just to rely on instinct than on rationality, and of course, vice versa! Lehrer covers his ass, and also discusses why trusting only your emotions isn't always the right thing to do, by giving us a look into a gambling addict's mind. The gambler keeps thinking that he is going to win because he has a feeling, but if he followed his rational mind, he would know to get out. At the end of the day, he tries to say that although you need both the rational and emotional mind, knowing when to use each one is the best way to become a better decision maker. I would recommend reading this book if you have any interest in trying to understand consumer behavior (that's why I picked up this book). Understanding why the mind works the way it does is that best way to learn how to influence that mind. Don't think I'm evil for saying that - that's just how marketing works and why it's a science. =)"

Thus, while a conscious control of mind can alter its thinking route, similarly emotions by inducing physical changes in the brain chemical process can alter the thinking route of mind. We, by using the executive function of the brain, are able to choose between which thoughts should dominate.Whether to choose between a rational decision or emotional decision depends upon the situation under hand. An essential art for success is to use the right brain part for the right purpose. There are certain occasions in which using the emotional brain is the right strategy to go with. However, there are other occasions in which you might become obsessed with it and a rational brain would be needed.- Emotional BrainSupported Situation: Arts, Performance, Taste and Aesthetics, Morality assessmentLimitations: Fluctuations in our dopamine process may affect the decision making capability. For example, immediately after a loss, we are less likely to make a new investment. The right way in that case is either wait until the emotional bias phase passes away, or modulate its effect by a conscious effort. - Rational BrainSupported Situation: Stocks evaluation, Airplanes emergency, Fire situationsLimitations: Our prefrontal cortex where rational thinking takes place has a definite limitation. It can process up to seven threads at a time. There are situations in which too many variables may distort our decision. A lot if irrelevant information may overwhelm our decision making capability. Therefore, we should be able to filter out irrelevant information in those situations.Some useful tips provided by the book:- Simple decisions like buying a kitchen salad cutter involves simple arithmetic, and thus only rational brain is good enough- Relatively complicated situations, like buying furniture or buying a house which involve many variables to be considered, demand a strategy in which our conscious mind should first consider all the available information. Then, in the next phase, we should allow our emotional brain to let it choose for the final decision. An example is poker which involves our rational as well as emotional cognitive skills. "
32,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,5,"I bought this book on a whim when I was browsing in the psychology section, mainly because this was the only book (besides Kahneman's most recent) in that section that was not a ridiculous self-help book. I'm not sure what's happening to the psychology section of book stores, but I do know that this was an excellent impulse buy. I really liked the way this book was organised. Each chapter built on the previous one, taking the reader through a really compelling narrative about how we decide - exactly as advertised. He does an excellent job of weaving personal narratives with the research, which really made the information about the way the brain works easier to understand and absolutely fascinating. One of the things I enjoyed most about the book was that he has restored some of my faith in my brain! This may sound a bit odd, but after reading books like Mistakes Were Made and Invisible Gorilla, you start to get a bit flustered with just how wrong you can be. This book was a good counterbalance to the effect of reading those. Although he does discuss the weaknesses of the way our brain regions interact when making a decision, he also discusses many of the strengths and provides really clear, tangible ways that we can protect ourselves from errors and play on those strengths. It's not an academic work, so the referencing is not very good (just a Bibliography and no in-text citations or footnotes). It didn't bother me that much, but because I read books like this for the curiosity factor, it does make it difficult to follow up on particular passages that piqued my interest. I imagine that if you were in this field of research, the lack of referencing would annoy you, but I'd say this book isn't directed at you, rather it's for the curious layman who wants to know more about what's happening inside his/her head when making decisions."
33,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11994675-leenah,5,"This book was SPLENDID! I admit that it took me a considerably long time to finish reading this book, but that was not due to boredom. This book is one of the very limited non-fiction books I've read and the first ever scientific one, so I felt the need to go slow and digest everything. How We Decide was not too scientific and complicated, or simple to the degree of childishness. The scientific information is made easier to understand by the striking examples Jonah Lehrer uses, which vary from strawberry jam to war tactics to flying a plane. The examples are so diverse - there are ones from sports, simple surveys, experiments, TV shows, hobbies, politics, and even criminals' actions!- and right to the point that you find yourself absolutely intrigued. Not only are the writing style and examples used in this book flawless, but the book also addresses a very important and interesting issue. From it's name, How We Decide explains the decision process in details, answering these fundamental questions: Do emotions interfere with decisions? In a beneficial or a devastating way? When do we use our emotions when we decide and when do we block them out? Can we actually over-think a decision? How do we avoid over-thinking without deciding haphazardly and irrationally? And finally, after it piles up all the information together, the book answers the most important question of all : How can we make better decisions?This book will prove to be a very interesting and useful read, and it will certainly satisfy your need for bragging that you are so smart you read, and understand, scientific books ;)"
34,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4813567-irrevenant,4,"I've read a few reviews saying this book trots out the same old case studies that are standard for this kind of book. That could be, but since I'm not familiar with them I'll be reviewing the book in and of itself, rather than making comparisons.I found the subject matter fascinating and the author's enthusiasm infectious. The book sets out to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of different modes of thought - conscious and rational vs intuitive - and which situations favour which mode of thinking. It achieves this aim brilliantly.The examples are a mix of the dramatic (high-stakes athletes and poker players) and the mundane (how do people choose a jam or a wine or a car). And the explanations are high-level but informative.There are subjects I would have liked to see covered in more depth (for example addictive behaviours and what can be done about them) but it's hard to fault a book for making you wish there were more of it. This is a diverse, bird's-eye summary that keeps the topic interesting.I've docked the book one star for a couple of reasons: Firstly, the section on practical application of the book's message felt very light and tacked on. Secondly, it sometimes felt a bit simplistic - as though, in his zeal to illustrate a point, the author skipped over some of the complicating nuances of an idea.I don't know if this is the best book in the field but if you're looking for a thought-provoking overview of ""how the brain makes up it's mind"", I'd definitely recommend this book."
35,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5398617-shawn,3,"Fascinating read that fluidly blends the latest studies in neuroscience with real-life examples, creative ideas and practical applications. Decision-making is our daily blessing and curse. Nobody makes perfect decisions all the time. However, this book argues that becoming self-aware of the logical and emotional parts of your brain can empower people with better decision-making skills and intuition. In fact, both rational thoughts originating from intentional considerations and innate hunches often based on emotion are crucial to maneuvering through life's choices, according to the book. For example, simple situations such as which strawberry jam to purchase at the grocery store are often hindered by paying too much attention to the (logical) pre-frontal cortex. Similarly, being taken hostage by an emotional reaction to a bad bet in poker that creates symptoms of ""loss aversion"" will often increase illogical risk-taking and hurt your overall chances at winning. Bottom line: Jonah Lehrer asserts that knowing when to pay attention to which part of the mind is the key to making the best decisions.I appreciated the attention to detailed studies that Jonah took, but was uncomfortable with his statements (portrayed as factual) on the ""evolution"" of the brain considering how the theory (key word) of evolution is full of holes (as would be noted by even the most staunch supporters), and is still just a theory. Basing assumptions off of a faulty theory can lead to inaccuracies and an inconsistent argument. Despite this misstep, I highly recommend the book."
36,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25763919-mimi,4," mind-blowing neuroscience of decision making!let me start by deciding which ice-cream i prefer (from the cover photo) : mmmmm ......sorry Lehrer but this is hardly a decision , i am a freaking-chocolate-queen! take off the chocolate one and then i struggle.So how do we DECIDE?  I'll put it in a nut-nutshell: There are two systems in our brain: 1-the Logical brain (neo-cortex): many scientists has considered this part of the brain as the sole generator of ""good"" rational decisions.and they went celebrating this fact for so long until a new view emerged.2-the emotional brain (limbic system): this one is regarded as an obstacle to the rational decision making because it involves feelings and intuition.The idea held in this book is that a good decision maker employs BOTH regions of the brain.The emotional brain helps in making split-second decision ,and judgements, and its what kept humans alive till now.the logical brain,however, allows us to take decision after long-time consideration, we study the pros and cons of the situation and choose what we deem better for ourselves.Another important thing is that, just like everything else had flaws, so does these decision-making regions.They are called biases.This book categories them and explained them efficiently to help us avoid falling in their trap ( easier said than done, but i loved knowing about them, at least when i fall for one I'll be like ahhhh it was you!)SO IF YOU ARE A fan of psychology-facts like me, this one is totally for you."
37,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1185127-jesse,0,"dropped: 07 may 2013Essentially this book says that there are good and bad times to use your rational brain to make decisions and that there are times when the best decisions you can make are those you will make by relying on your emotions. If the problem has few variables then reason can cope with that and won’t be overloaded. If the problem is sufficiently novel – that is, you are in a situation in which you have never been before, you need to avoid relying on your emotions and you need to try to think. This book is not trying to tell you that there are times when you should not think at all – it is telling you that you should always think about the decisions you are making and how you are making those decisions, but to also understand that we are human and we ALL tend to rationalise our behaviour.The more open you are to the possibility you may be wrong the more likely you are to be right. The more prepared you are to listen to others, the less likely you are to stuff up. The more consciously people set up ways in which their views will be challenged the more likely they are not to be fooled by their own bullshit.- Trevor"
38,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2264393-wendy-yu,3,"The author focuses on the ""emotion"" versus ""rationality"" divide in decision-making, choosing anecdotes and studies that explore how people respond to situations either with their gut or through rationalizing. Some people panic and fail to use their heads (running from fire, piloting a plane), but others over-rationalize and make poor decisions compared to just going with their ""good feelings"" (stocks, choosing the best jam, choosing the best car when a lot of information is available). The first anecdote I thought was very interesting that described how a person who lost the emotional center in their brain in an accident stopped being able to make ANY decisions AT ALL: they would endlessly create pro/con lists, or calculate NPV, but could not actually pull the trigger -- they needed an emotional push.The book is studies-driven, which I usually like, but fails to tie them together into a useful takeaway narrative. The last chapter tries to paint a framework, but is almost comically unhelpful (""In these situations, use your emotions to choose BUT NOT in these other subset of sitations, and vice versa""). So, in the end, the book is fun if you like to hear studies and anecdotes, but the lessons fail to stick.Book dish: chocolate ice cream cone."
39,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130454-donna,5,"How We Decide is a very important book. I've read many good books about the human brain, but this is perhaps the most up-to-date, accessible, and entertaining one yet. Jonah Lehrer uses fascinating real-life stories to illustrate what scientists have so-far discovered about why we do what we do and how to use that knowledge to make good decisions.When should we listen to our emotions, and when should we use reason in making choices? How can we learn to combine the special kinds of knowledge provided by various parts of the brain? What questions could be more important than these? The golf pro who froze on the 18th hole. The naval communications officer who had to decide whether a radar blip was an incoming missile or a fighter plane. The physics professor who's a world-class poker player. Each story provides a lesson in how our own brains work in everyday life.A topic of growing interest in education, philosophy, business, the military and other fields is metacognition--the art and science of monitoring and understanding our own thought processes. Lehrer's book can be an informative and virtually pain-free leap forward in developing this essential skill."

Both have their place, and I guarantee you'll be surprised by some of them (make a pro/con list when buying a can opener, but just go with your gut when buying a house).

The problem is that the book is littered with facts tossed out here and there, many of which are not accurate.

Not that all of this is specifically answered, but Lehrer offers so much scientific insight to how our brains work when choosing. Emotions--get this--are basically logical messages to our conscious minds based on experience. Though the gut isn't foolproof, it makes sense to take it into account. Lehrer's writing makes sense, is entertaining and informational. I was annoying all my friends by texting them some interesting bit and stopping Ross' movie watching to read a passage and muse. This book would be a fabulous book club read--great conversation starter! I also recommend it to teachers. Lehrer presents fascinating studies that inspired my teacher brain to go ""AH!

Really helps understand which decisions are best made consciously and by rational deduction (generally the less complex ones) and which need a combination of data and emotionally intuition (generally the more complex ones). It is extremely well written and structured, with some great memorable examples of decision making under life and death pressure. Particularly memorable is the experienced fire fighter in a prairie fire who knew he couldn't out run the 30mph fire so in a second he burned the ground in front of him and lay down in it. He shouted at his less experienced colleagues to stop and do the same, but their fear circuits would not be overridden, though two accidentally fell into a gully and survived also. 18 firefighters died."

The first chapter discusses Tom Brady of the Patriots making a Superbowl decision. Then Lehrer goes on to discuss the problems one man had making decisions after the ""emotional"" portion of his brain was impaired. While some of the examples Lehrer chooses to illuminate his thesis are familiar from other books on psychology and neuroscience, many are new and absorbing. I did come away with some insights into decision-making under stress and really enjoyed learning of the way psychology experiments can be devised to test certain aspects of our decision-making.

Out of all the facts and examples that may be 'interesting' to some, I've only enjoyed one chapter - ""Emotional Signals.""

63,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
65,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
66,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
67,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

72,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
73,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
74,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
75,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."
76,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7241202-katie,1,"This is my first Goodreads book review, and I suppose I should have saved this distinction for something that I actually enjoyed reading, but this book left such a bad taste in my mouth that I decided to expound upon my one star rating.I listened to the audiobook version from my library's website, and I guess it is pretty amazing that they even had it considering the author's plagiarism scandal over this and other books which prompted the publisher to withdraw it from publication. (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

78,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
79,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
80,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
81,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
82,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
83,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
84,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
85,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
86,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."
87,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310746-jeff,3,"tl;di; version: Don't neglect your intuition's emotional feelings.Longer version:Lehrer (the author) spends a lot of time debunking Plato's idea of a charioteer trying to steer the two opposing horses of rationality and emotions with the implication that emotions are necessarily bad and get in the way of good rational thinking. A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"
88,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,2,"So this book would have gotten 3 or 4 stars if I hadn't already read Blink or Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness or Stumbling on Happiness or maybe if I hadn't read ALL of those books (plus some more). Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

93,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
95,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
96,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
97,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

102,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
103,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
104,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
105,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."
106,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7241202-katie,1,"This is my first Goodreads book review, and I suppose I should have saved this distinction for something that I actually enjoyed reading, but this book left such a bad taste in my mouth that I decided to expound upon my one star rating.I listened to the audiobook version from my library's website, and I guess it is pretty amazing that they even had it considering the author's plagiarism scandal over this and other books which prompted the publisher to withdraw it from publication. (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

108,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
109,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
110,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
111,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
112,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
113,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
114,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
115,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
116,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."
117,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310746-jeff,3,"tl;di; version: Don't neglect your intuition's emotional feelings.Longer version:Lehrer (the author) spends a lot of time debunking Plato's idea of a charioteer trying to steer the two opposing horses of rationality and emotions with the implication that emotions are necessarily bad and get in the way of good rational thinking. A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"
118,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,2,"So this book would have gotten 3 or 4 stars if I hadn't already read Blink or Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness or Stumbling on Happiness or maybe if I hadn't read ALL of those books (plus some more). Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

123,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
125,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
126,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
127,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

132,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
133,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
134,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
135,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."

(http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

138,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
139,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
140,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
141,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
142,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
143,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
144,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
145,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
146,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."
147,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310746-jeff,3,"tl;di; version: Don't neglect your intuition's emotional feelings.Longer version:Lehrer (the author) spends a lot of time debunking Plato's idea of a charioteer trying to steer the two opposing horses of rationality and emotions with the implication that emotions are necessarily bad and get in the way of good rational thinking. A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"
148,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,2,"So this book would have gotten 3 or 4 stars if I hadn't already read Blink or Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness or Stumbling on Happiness or maybe if I hadn't read ALL of those books (plus some more). Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

153,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
155,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
156,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
157,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

162,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
163,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
164,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
165,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."

(http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

168,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
169,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
170,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
171,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
172,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
173,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
174,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
175,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
176,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."
177,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310746-jeff,3,"tl;di; version: Don't neglect your intuition's emotional feelings.Longer version:Lehrer (the author) spends a lot of time debunking Plato's idea of a charioteer trying to steer the two opposing horses of rationality and emotions with the implication that emotions are necessarily bad and get in the way of good rational thinking. A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"
178,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,2,"So this book would have gotten 3 or 4 stars if I hadn't already read Blink or Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness or Stumbling on Happiness or maybe if I hadn't read ALL of those books (plus some more). Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

183,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
185,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
186,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
187,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

192,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
193,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
194,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
195,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."

(http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

198,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
199,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
200,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
201,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
202,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
203,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
204,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
205,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
206,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."
207,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310746-jeff,3,"tl;di; version: Don't neglect your intuition's emotional feelings.Longer version:Lehrer (the author) spends a lot of time debunking Plato's idea of a charioteer trying to steer the two opposing horses of rationality and emotions with the implication that emotions are necessarily bad and get in the way of good rational thinking. A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"
208,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,2,"So this book would have gotten 3 or 4 stars if I hadn't already read Blink or Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness or Stumbling on Happiness or maybe if I hadn't read ALL of those books (plus some more). Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

213,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
215,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
216,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
217,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

222,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
223,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
224,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
225,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."

(http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

228,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
229,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
230,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
231,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
232,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
233,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
234,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
235,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
236,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."
237,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310746-jeff,3,"tl;di; version: Don't neglect your intuition's emotional feelings.Longer version:Lehrer (the author) spends a lot of time debunking Plato's idea of a charioteer trying to steer the two opposing horses of rationality and emotions with the implication that emotions are necessarily bad and get in the way of good rational thinking. A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"
238,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,2,"So this book would have gotten 3 or 4 stars if I hadn't already read Blink or Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness or Stumbling on Happiness or maybe if I hadn't read ALL of those books (plus some more). Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

243,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
245,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
246,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
247,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

252,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
253,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
254,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
255,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."

(http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

258,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
259,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
260,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
261,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
262,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
263,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
264,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
265,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
266,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."
267,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310746-jeff,3,"tl;di; version: Don't neglect your intuition's emotional feelings.Longer version:Lehrer (the author) spends a lot of time debunking Plato's idea of a charioteer trying to steer the two opposing horses of rationality and emotions with the implication that emotions are necessarily bad and get in the way of good rational thinking. A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"
268,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,2,"So this book would have gotten 3 or 4 stars if I hadn't already read Blink or Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness or Stumbling on Happiness or maybe if I hadn't read ALL of those books (plus some more). Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

273,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,4,"Really fascinating book about the role of emotions in decision making. Encourages people to think strategically about whether to go with their gut reaction, or to logically think it out. It’s not always successful to just blink.p. 51 It’s not the quantity of the practice, it’s the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. Search for your mistakes, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. Self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind.	The physicist Niels Bohr once defined an expert as “a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.” From the perspective of the brain, Bohr was absolutely right. Expertise is simply the wisdom that emerges from cellular error. Mistakes aren’t things to be discouraged. On the contrary, they should be cultivated and carefully investigated.	Unfortunately, children are often taught the exact opposite. Instead of praising kids for trying hard, teachers typically praise them for their innate intelligence. This type of encouragement actually backfires, since it leads students to see mistakes as signs of stupidity and not as the building blocks of knowledge. The regrettable outcome is that kids never learn how to learn (Carol Dweck, Stanford experiments).p. 91 Asymmetric paternalism--creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions (i.e. Shlomo Benartzi & Richard Thaler’s Save More Tomorrow 401K accounts).p. 107 Aristotle argued that one of the critical functions of the rational soul was to make sure that emotions were intelligently applied to the real world. “Anyone can become angry—that’s easy,” Aristotle wrote. “But to become angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.” That requires some thought.p. 113 In November 2007, a team of researchers from NIMH and McGill U announced that they had uncovered the specific deficits of the ADHD brain. The disorder turns out to be largely a developmental problem; often, the brains of kids with ADHD develop at a significantly slower pace than normal. This lag was most obvious in the prefrontal cortex, which meant that these kids literally lacked the mental muscles needed to resist alluring stimuli. (On average, their frontal lobes were three and a half years behind schedule.) The good news, however, is that the brain almost always recovers from its slow start. By the end of adolescence, the frontal lobes in theses kids reached normal size. It’s not a coincidence that their behavioral problems began to disappear at about the same time.p. 119 Louis Pasteur—“Chance favors the prepared mind.”p. 136 “Choking” is caused by thinking too much. When a person gets nervous about performing, he naturally becomes extra self-conscious. He starts to focus on himself, trying to make sure that he doesn’t make any mistakes. He begins scrutinizing actions that are best performed on autopilot. This kind of deliberation can be lethal for a performer. The natural fluidity of performance is lost. The grace of talent disappears.p. 145 A recent study found that when a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as “satisfied with life” as a person with a short commute.p. 146 Anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of people get better after receiving pretend medical treatments.p. 188 The problem with statistics is that they don’t activate our moral emotions [a picture of a starving child does:]. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can’t comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.”p. 189 When children are molested or neglected or unloved as children, their emotional brains are warped.p. 246 People in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than people who are cranky and depressed. (Happy people solve nearly 20 percent more word puzzles than unhappy people.) Researchers suspect this is because the brain areas associated with executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex and the ACC, aren’t as preoccupied with managing emotional life. In other words, they aren’t worrying about why you’re not happy, which means they are free to solve the problem at hand.p. 247 Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. Second, continually remind yourself of what you don’t know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Poker players call these “bad beats”. Colin Powell made a number of mistakes in the run-up to the Iraq war, but his advice to his intelligence officers was psychologically astute: “Tell me what you know,” he told his advisers. “Then tell me what you don’t know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated.”p. 248 YOU KNOW MORE THAN YOU KNOW. One of the enduring paradoxes of the human mind is that it doesn’t know itself very well. The conscious brain is ignorant of its own underpinnings, blind to all that neural activity taking place outside the prefrontal cortex. This is why people have emotions: they are windows into the unconscious, visceral representations of all the information we process but don’t perceive.p. 249 The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you’ve developed expertise in a particular area—once you’ve made the requisite mistakes—it’s important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience.THINK ABOUT THINKING. If you’re going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. Of course, even the most attentive and self-aware minds will still make mistakes. But the best decision makers don’t despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. This is the most astonishing thing about the human brain; it can always improve itself. Tomorrow, we can make better decisions.p. 252 What caused the dramatic reduction in pilot error? The first factor was the introduction in the mid-1980s of realistic flight simulators. For the first time, pilots could practice making decisions. And they could do this without leaving the ground. These simulators revolutionized pilot training. 	The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision when up in the air. Simulators also take advantage of the way the brain learns from experience. After pilots complete their “flight,” they are forced to endure an exhaustive debriefing. The instructor scrutinizes all of their decisions, so that the pilots think about why, exactly, they decided to gain altitude after the engine fire, or why they chose to land in the hailstorm. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance.	There was one other crucial factor in the dramatic decline of pilot error: the development of a decision-making strategy known as Cockpit Resource Management (CRM). The impetus for CRM came from a large NASA study in the 1970s of pilot error; it concluded that many cockpit mistakes were attributable, at least in part, to the “God-like certainty” of the pilot in command. If other crew members had been consulted, or if the pilot had considered other alternatives, then some of the bad decisions might have been avoided. As a result, the goal of CRM was to create an environment in which a diversity of viewpoints was freely shared.	In recent years, CRM has moved beyond the cockpit. Many hospitals have realized that the same decision-making techniques that can prevent pilot error can also prevent unnecessary mistakes during surgery. The Nebraska Medical Center began training its teams in CRM in 2005. All surgical-team members are encouraged to express their concerns freely to the attending surgeon. In addition, team members engage in postoperation debriefings at which everyone involved is supposed to share his or her view of the surgery. What mistakes were made? And how can they be avoided next time?	The results have been impressive. A 2007 analysis found that after fewer than six months of CRM training, the percentage of staff members who “felt free to question the decisions of those with more authority” had gone from 29% to 86%. More important, this increased willingness to point out potential errors led to a dramatic decrease in medical mistakes. Before CRM only around 21% of all cardiac surgeries and cardiac catheterizations were classified as “uneventful cases,” meaning that nothing had gone wrong. After CRM training, however, the number of “uneventful cases” rose to 62%.	The reason CRM is so effective is that it encourages teams to think together. It deters certainty and stimulates debate. In this sense, CRM creates the ideal atmosphere for good decision-making, in which a diversity of opinion is openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. Such a process not only prevents mistakes but also leads to startling new insights.p. 258 Aviation is just about the only field that consistently manages to operate at the highest level of performance, which is defined by six sigma, the managerial buzzword for any process that produces fewer than 3.4 defects per one million opportunities.Further reading: Seed magazine, Proust was a Neuroscientist, the Mind Matters blog for Scientific American, and his own blog, The Frontal Cortex."

The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of deciders from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.

His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better? A Q&A with Jonah Lehrer, Author of *How We Decide*Q: Why did you want to write a book about decision-making?A: It all began with Cheerios. I'm an incredibly indecisive person. There I was, aimlessly wandering the cereal aisle of the supermarket, trying to choose between the apple-cinnamon and honey-nut varieties. It was an embarrassing waste of time and yet it happened to me all the time. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough: I needed to understand what was happening inside my brain as I contemplated my breakfast options. I soon realized, of course, that this new science of decision making had implications far grander than Cheerios.Q: What are some of those implications?A: Life is ultimately just a series of decisions, from the mundane (what should I eat for breakfast?) to the profound (what should I do with my life?). Until recently, though, we had no idea how our brain actually made these decisions. As a result, we relied on untested assumptions, such as the assumption that people were rational creatures. (This assumption goes all the way back to Plato and the ancient Greeks.) But now, for the first time in human history, we can look inside our mind and see how we actually think. It turns out that we weren't designed to be rational or logical or even particularly deliberate. Instead, our mind holds a messy network of different areas, many of which are involved with the production of emotion. Whenever we make a decision, the brain is awash in feeling, driven by its inexplicable passions. Even when we try to be reasonable and restrained, these emotional impulses secretly influence our judgment. Of course, by understanding how the human mind makes decisions--and by learning about the decision-making mistakes that we're all vulnerable to--we can learn to make better decisions.Q: Can neuroscience really teach us how to make better decisions?A: My answer is a qualified yes. Despite the claims of many self-help books, there is no secret recipe for decision-making, no single strategy that can work in every situation. The real world is just too complex. The thought process that excels in the supermarket won't pass muster in the Oval Office. Therefore natural selection endowed us with a brain that is enthusiastically pluralist. Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions and gut instinct. The secret, of course, is knowing when to use different styles of thought--when to trust feelings and when to exercise reason. In my book, I devoted a chapter to looking at the world through the prism of the game of poker and found that, in poker as in life, two broad categories of decisions exist: math problems and mysteries. The first step to making the right decision, then, is accurately diagnosing the problem and figuring out which brain system to rely on. Should we trust our intuition or calculate the probabilities? We always need to be thinking about how we think. Q: Are you a good poker player?A: When I was in Vegas, hanging out with some of best poker players in the world, I convinced myself that I'd absorbed the tricks of the trade, that I could use their advice to win some money. So I went to a low-stakes table at the Rio, put $300 on the line, and waited for the chips to accumulate. Instead, I lost all my money in less than an hour. It was an expensive but valuable lesson: there's a big difference between understanding how experts think and being able to think like an expert.Q: Why write this book now?A: Neuroscience can seem abstract, a science preoccupied with questions about the cellular details of perception and the memory of fruit flies. In recent years, however, the field has been invaded by some practical thinkers. These scientists want to use the nifty experimental tools of modern neuroscience to explore some of the mysteries of everyday life. How should we choose a cereal? What areas of the brain are triggered in the shopping mall? Why do smart people accumulate credit card debt and take out subprime mortgages? How can you use the brain to explain financial bubbles? For the first time, these incredibly relevant questions have rigorously scientific answers. It all goes back to that classical Greek aphorism: Know thyself. I'd argue that the discoveries of modern neuroscience allow us to know ourselves (and our decisions!) in an entirely new way.Q: How We Decide draws from the latest research in neuroscience yet also analyzes some crucial moments in the lives of a variety of ""deciders,"" from the football star Tom Brady to a soap opera director. Why did you take this approach?A: Herbert Simon, the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, famously compared our mind to a pair of scissors. One blade, he said, represented the brain. The other blade was the specific environment in which our brain was operating. If you want to understand the function of scissors, Simon said, then you have to look at both blades simultaneously. What I wanted to do in How We Decide was venture out of the lab and into the real world so that I could see the scissors at work. I discuss some ingenious experiments in this book, but let's face it: the science lab is a startlingly artificial place. And so, wherever possible, I tried to explore these scientific theories in the context of everyday life. Instead of just writing about hyperbolic discounting and the feebleness of the prefrontal cortex, I spent time with a debt counselor in the Bronx. When I became interested in the anatomy of insight (where do our good ideas come from?) I interviewed a pilot whose epiphany in the cockpit saved hundreds of lives. That's when you really begin to appreciate the power of this new science--when you can use its ideas to explain all sorts of important phenomena, such as the risky behavior of teenagers, the amorality of psychopaths, and the tendency of some athletes to choke under pressure.Q: What do you do in the cereal aisle now?A: I was about halfway through writing the book when I got some great advice from a scientist. I was telling him about my Cheerios dilemma when he abruptly interrupted me: ""The secret to happiness,"" he said,""is not wasting time on irrelevant decisions."" Of course, this sage advice didn't help me figure out what kind of cereal I actually wanted to eat for breakfast. So I did the only logical thing: I bought my three favorite Cheerios varieties and combined them all in my cereal bowl. Problem solved. (Photo © Nina Subin, 2008)  From Publishers Weekly “As Lehrer describes in fluid prose, the brain’s reasoning centers are easily fooled, often making judgments based on nonrational factors like presentation (a sales pitch or packaging)...Lehrer is a delight to read, and this is a fascinating book (some of which appeared recently, in a slightly different form, in the New Yorker) that will help everyone better understand themselves and their decision making.” —Publisher's Weekly, starred review "
275,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"This topic fascinated me and the prose was very smooth, but when I finished, I felt something was missing. Lehrer is a good writer in the general sense (and probably a good scientist too) but in this book he violated a rule of philosophical writing: he didn't precisely define his terms. It is difficult to write coherently on reason and emotion, and especially to focus on the areas where they blur together, relying solely on commonsense definitions and simultaneously pushing at those commonsense boundaries. Thus, the major limitation of this book is that Lehrer fails to precisely define ""reason"" and ""emotion,"" which is all the more necessary for clarity because he claims they are interrelated phenomena. For example, if indeed ""every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached"" (p. 107), how do we know whether this self-awareness is part of emotion, reason, or the ""metacognition"" that chooses whether to use emotion and reason in any particular decision? Similarly, Lehrer does not distinguish between reason and the metacognition that reflects on reason. It may well be that both of these processes occur in the prefrontal cortex and, as such, neuroscientists cannot yet distinguish them on the level of brain activity. However, there is no excuse to muddle these processes in the book, as philosophers and psychologists can certainly distinguish between them.He writes: ""How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. The prefrontal cortex allows each of us to contemplate his or her own mind, a talent psychologists call metacognition. We know when we are angry; every emotional state comes with self-awareness attached, so that an individual can try to figure out why he's feeling what he's feeling. If the particular feeling makes no sense--if the amygdala is simply responding to a loss frame, for example-then it can be discounted. The prefrontal cortex can deliberately choose to ignore the emotional brain."" (p. 107)Can emotion, however, ignore the prefrontal cortex? Are the two brain systems in an equal tug-of-war? What happens when emotion wins the argument?""Plato...liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said, is the charioteer...One of the horses is well bred and well behaved, but even the best charioteer has difficulty controlling the other horse."" (p. 9) He goes on to clarify that the charioteer represents reason, controlling the horses of various emotions: ""What we discover when we look at the brain is that the horses and the charioteer depend upon each other. If it weren't for our emotions, reason wouldn't exist at all."" (p. 13.) But if the charioteer is the faculty of reason that reflects on emotion, who or what reflects on reason? Can reason evaluate itself? And how do we avoid imagining this ""charioteer"" as a homunculus, a little person in the brain who does our thinking for us? In one instance, he even seems to invoke the homunculus, when he muses on the evolution of the human mind: ""What these animals couldn't do, however, was reflect on their own decisions...What couldn't be done automatically couldn't be done at all. The charioteer had yet to appear."" (p. 24)""Sometimes,"" he writes, ""we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think."" (p. xvi) On the other hand, after telling a story about people who tried to explain their gut instinct, he presents a possibly conflicting conclusion: ""The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness."" (p. 144) So, should we think about how we think (and feel), or should we just think?His opinion on financial investment strategy is difficult to understand. ""In order to make the right investment decisions, the mind needs emotional input, but those emotions need to exist in a dialogue with rational analysis."" (pp. 239-240) But on the other hand, he points out that success is not guaranteed: ""Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random than we can imagine. That's what our emotions can't understand."" (p. 70) And just as football player Tom Brady said, ""There are no firm rules. You just feel like you're going to the right place...And that's where I throw it"" (p. 8), he quotes poker player Michael Binger: ""The bet was damn risky. But it just felt like the right thing to do. You can do all the probabilistic analysis in the world, but in the end it all comes down to something you can't quite explain."" (pp. 228-229) It is hard to take practical advice from this, since most of us have neither the talent, expertise, nor luck to follow in the footsteps of these stars merely by following our gut instincts. Chapter 6 on moral decision-making was especially thought-provoking for me. Lehrer writes, ""...the human amygdala is activated when a person merely thinks about committing a 'moral transgression.'"" (p. 171) I don't mean to sound under-wowed, because I am fascinated by the remark, but the longer I reflect on it, the less I understand its implications. Does this mean that the amygdala is part and parcel of the moral thought process? If so, is there metacognition that decides whether emotion should be removed from the moral thought process--and is it even possible to do so? Or, by removing empathy, does the decision process become non-moral? He says morality is deciding how to treat other people, which involves consciousness of the feelings of others. Many of his examples suggest that morality is, by definition, emotional. But then why would metacognition be important? Is morality exempt from the metacognition? The main role that reason plays in morality, he suggests, is confabulating justifications after the fact (p. 173)And what is the meaning of quoting Jonathan Haidt's opinion that ""moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment...Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first....""? (p. 172) How can this be reconciled with Lehrer's own opinion that ""At its core, moral decision-making is about sympathy....you need to develop a theory about what's happening inside their minds so that your emotional brain can imitate the activity of their emotional brains."" (p. 180) Consider this: Your theory or hunch of what someone else is feeling can be right or wrong. This means that moral decision-making isn't like aesthetic judgment at all. It's not a private experience that lacks external consequences. If your private feelings and opinions are different enough, you are cognitively and therefore morally disabled, which is an evaluation that is made on a social level."
276,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,1,"I found this book and interesting and enjoyable read. It is a popular book about neuroscience, and attempts to summarize recent findings about decision-making in the human brain and draw some inferences from them. The author describes what he considers the traditional view of thinking: ""Ever since the ancient Greeks,"" he argues, people have believed that ""humans are rational. We are supposed to consciously analyze the alternatives and carefully weigh the pros and cons. In other words, we are deliberate and logical creatures."" So, according to Lehrer, we have generally emphasized logic in our thinking, partly as a positive description of how we do think and partly as a normative prescription for how we ought to think. ""There's only one problem with this assumption of human rationality,"" Lehrer warns, ""it's wrong. It's not how the brain works.""From this point, the book really becomes a collection of anecdotes--about pilots making quick judgments when they find out their airplane's systems are failing, about poker players scrutinizing each others' faces for ""tells"", about firefighters reacting as they are engulfed in flames, and so on. These anecdotes are powerful illustrations of Lehrer's main point: that there are some decisions that are well-suited to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for logical thinking, and other decisions that are best left to the other parts of the brain, which are more emotional, intuitive and instinctive. Lehrer ascribes the traditional view chiefly to Plato, who then becomes his foil throughout the book: ""Plato"" he tells us ""liked to imagine the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain, he said is the charioteer; it holds the rein and decides where the horses run... The job of the charioteer is to keep the dark horse from running wild and to keep both horses moving forward."" The dark horse represents our lusts and appetites, while the other represents spiritedness and pride. Throughout the book, Lehrer returns to Plato's metaphor, trying to convince the reader that Plato's vision of the mind was deeply misguided.But Lehrer caricatures Plato, who is not so easily interpreted or refuted. Plato used many different metaphors for the mind, not just this one, perhaps because he found none of them wholly adequate. And because Plato wrote dialogues, in which various participants (usually including Socrates) argued back and forth about wisdom, courage, justice and the rest, which often failed to reach a satisfactory answer, it is difficult to tell what Plato himself actually thought. What's clear though is that he did not hold to the simplistic view Lehrer ascribes to him: that all decisions are or at least should be made with logical deliberation. Just to use one famous counter-example, Plato records Socrates as hearing a voice in his mind that warned him when his logical thinking was leading him astray--the famous daemon. He heeded this voice unfailingly, even when he could not explain its judgments. Now this voice could be interpreted as something supernatural, or even as a symptom of mental illness, but it sounds very much like the kind of instinctive hunch Lehrer extolls. Socrates, at crucial moments, was abandoning ratiocination in favor of his instincts and intuition, just as Lehrer advises.Another flaw in the book is its misinterpretation of behavioral economics. Lehrer argues that market participants are often irrational, pointing to work on this by famous psychologists and economists like Kahneman and Thaler. He then argues that this irrationality is at the heart of stock market bubbles and was the cause of the recent financial crisis. He then bizarrely presents this as evidence in favor of Euguene Fama's efficient market hypothesis!?! ""Fama"" he tells us, ""looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next."" But Lehrer has it all backwards and upside down. It's true that Fama has argued that it is difficult or impossible to beat the market over time, without taking on more risk, but he argues that because he believes investors generally do behave rationally--so that all available information is very quickly reflected in stock prices. Lehrer's contention, that even experienced traders tend to get carried away by their emotions into making systematic errors that sometimes result in bubbles, is diametrically opposed to Fama's view. Lehrer's view suggests those who can keep their heads in a bubble and analyze the situation coolly and logically, can profit from market inefficiency, as Warren Buffett has argued. But Lehrer himself seems unaware of this, and seems also to be fundamentally confused about what behavioral economics and the efficient market hypothesis are all about. Aside from its misreading of Plato and confusion about market efficiency, though, the book is a good one, well worth reading. It makes the reader think a little more deeply about thinking. It argues persuasively that logic is not the right tool to use for every decision. Lehrer is a little vague about when logical thought will lead good decisions and when it won't, but he does offer some general guidance. The prefrontal cortex appears to be right for new and unfamiliar situations, and for simple decisions with only a small number of facts and variables involved. But it is easily overwhelmed. More complicated situations call for the intuitive and emotional part of the brain to take charge. Lehrer advises us to absorb the relevant information, and then go with our feelings in such situations. Our best thinking is subconscious thinking. The charioteer is feeble and indecisive compared to the steeds he vainly hopes to steer. And when he interferes too much, he screws up the thought process, and the whole chariot crashes. Logical thinking has a place, but a subordinate one."
277,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,4,"As a matter of habit I typically work my way slowly through 3 or 4 books at a time, reading a few pages in each one every day as opposed to serial reading. However, Jonah Lehrer’s HOW WE DECIDE was such an entertaining read, for the most part I laid the other books aside. Here’s a small sample of what I took away from the book (even though what follows does not reflect Lehrer’s engaging style):1.	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the “primitive” brain – areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system- to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to a specific [potential decision or course of action] the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives – this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness—and converted that assessment into a positive emotion (p. 18)2.	The stimulation of the NAcc (The nucleus accumbens – a collection of neurons) triggered a massive release of the neurotransmitter [dopamine], which overwhelmed the rodents with ecstasy [in an experiment the author relates]. In humans, addictive drugs work the same way: a crack addict who has just gotten a fix is no different than a rat in an electrical rapture. The brains of both creatures have been blinded by pleasure. This then, became the dopaminergic cliché; it was the chemical explanation for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. .. But happiness isn’t the only feeling that dopamine produces. [It] helps to regulate all of our emotions (p. 35).3.	Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions (p. 48).4.	Trusting one’s emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice (p. 49).5.	It’s silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Dopamine neurons weren’t designed to deal with the random oscillations of Wall Street. When you spend lots of money on investment-management fees, or sink your savings into the latest hot mutual fund, or pursue unrealistic growth goals, you are slavishly following your primitive reward circuits. Unfortunately, the same circuits that are so good at tracking juice rewards and radar blips will fail completely in these utterly unpredictable situations. That’s why, over the long run, a randomly selected stock portfolio will beat the expensive experts with their fancy computer models. And why the vast majority of mutual funds in any given year will underperform the S&P 500. … The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio—who doesn’t buy or sell a single stock—out-performs the average “active” investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. The world is more random that we can imagine. That’s what our emotions can’t understand (p. 69).6.	Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It’s part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. This is why in marital interactions, it generally takes at least five kind comments to compensate for one critical comment… People believe that a person who’s been convicted of murder must perform at least twenty-five acts of “life-saving heroism” in order to make up for his or her one crime. There’s no rational reason for us to treat gains and losses or compliments and criticism so differently. But we do. The only way to avoid loss aversion is to know about the concept (p. 81).7.	Voters weren’t using their reasoning faculties to analyze the facts; they were using reason to preserve their partisan certainty. And then, once the subjects had arrived at favorable interpretations of the evidence, blithely excusing the contradictions of their chosen candidate, they activated the internal reward circuits in their brains and experienced a rush of pleasurable emotion. Self-delusion, in other words, felt really good. Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want,” Westen says, “and then they get massively reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones.” … All of us are rationalizers (p. 205).8.	The reason knowing more about politics doesn’t erase partisan bias is that voters tend to assimilate only those facts that confirm what they already believe. If a piece of information doesn’t follow Republican talking points – and Clinton’s deficit reduction didn’t fit the tax-and-spend liberal stereotype- then the information is conveniently ignored. “Voters think that they’re thinking, Bartels says, “but what they’re really doing is inventing facts or ignoring facts so that they can rationalize decisions they’ve already made.” Once you identify with a political party, the world is edited to fit with your ideology (p. 206)…. We all silence cognitive dissonance through self-imposed ignorance (p. 207).9.	Conclusions: Lehrer relates the following advice: “Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don’t try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.” (p 237)"

282,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2502245-blayne,5,"How We Decide, Jonah Lehrer, 2009So you think you are in control and make rational decisions? Think again. Scientists have only recently started to see how the brain works when we make decisions. Lehrer does a great job of communicating science’s most recent studies on decision making and the brain….and get this, he does it in layman’s terms and makes it interesting. I could not put the book down and at 265 pages, it’s a fast paced and cram packed read.The book is reminiscent of Quirkology by Richard Wiseman. Like Quirkology, the book is full of odd and interesting science experiments, such as - Why is an experiment with 4 year old child and a single marshmallow, the most accurate indicator of what that child’s IQ will be when they are 18? Quirkology is mostly a collection of various odd scientific studies, Lehrer pinpoints studies done on how the brain makes decisionsI like reading atheist literature, like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. The basis of their arguments are set in the concrete foundation of logic and reason. Indeed, the USA and its Constitution, and legal system were borne from the Age of Enlightment. Common thought is that if we only apply logic and reason to all known facts involved a particular decision, we will always make the best decisions…Just the Facts as Joe Friday would say. But what about hunches and gut feelings. Where does that hunch or feeling come from?It bubbles up from your unconscious brain; your emotions. When we make a decision, the emotion section of our brain fires milliseconds before the logically section fires. The logical section of the brain is then only acting like a lawyer, quickly gathering facts and data that justifies the decision made by the emotional section. The logical section actively ignores data and facts that contradict the decision of the emotional section. Interesting, isn’t it. One of the more interesting experiments described by Lehrer goes like this. Participants were given a sum of money. Four decks of cards were placed in front of them. Each card had a positive reward (+$100) or a negative reward (-$100). The participants were told to flip cards over from any of the four decks, and try to end up with more money than when they started. What the participants did not know, was that two decks contained more favorable outcomes and less unfavorable outcomes (such as +$500 and -$50). The other two decks contained more unfavorable cards and less favorable cards (such as +$50 and -$500.) On average, the participants realized the decks were “stacked” after flipping 80 cards over. Analyzing, each participants choices, they started selecting more cards from the favorable piles, than the unfavorable piles after 50 cards were flipped. This indicates that the participants unconsciously recognized the decks were stacked much earlier than they consciously realized. The participants were also hooked up to sensors that detected pulse rate changes and minute sweating. Pulse rate changes and sweating are attributed to emotions/gut feelings/hunches, (think lie detector test.) The pulse rates and sweat glands started working after the participant had flipped only ten cards. So the participants gut noticed the decks were stacked at 10 cards; the sub-conscience recognized it at 50 cards; and the participant consciously realized the difference at 80 cards. In theory, the experiment shows that a participant’s gut noticed something was awry, 8x times faster than the logical part of the participant’s brain.Lehrer shows goes on to show that when we over think, we make mistakes; when we do not think at all, we make mistakes; and most importantly the more certain we are, the more we are likely to be wrong. The Chapter on Moral Decisions was eye-opening.But all is not lost. Lehrer takes the information gathered by science, and shines the light on how to improve our decision making process. Such as spend time thinking about how you think. If you think something is right, spend time trying to think how you could be wrong. If you are a conservative, read some liberal literature. If you are liberal, listen to right-wing talk radio. He says to eavesdrop on your internal dialogue.So far, this is the best book I have read this year. Friends of mine highly suggest “Predictable Irrational” by Dan Ariely, which is along the same lines, but aims at the fundamental flaw in economic theory, that individuals always act rationally.“How We Decide” ny Jonah Lehrer is available at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library on the second floor (153.83 Leh.)"
283,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,3,"HOW WE DECIDEChapter 1. Subject with no emotion => totally indecisive.Chapter 2. Dopamine spreads emotions around the brain. It is a pattern matcher: learns to spike in anticipation of reward, learns to stop spiking when no reward received. So our emotions are actually pattern matching at the subconscious level: our logic doesn't have the answer, but our feelings do.Experiment: 4 bad decks. 2 good, 2 bad. Took about 50 draws before players started drawing only from the good deck, 100 draws before they could explain why, but after 10 draws their hands started clamming up when reaching towards a bad deck.Chapter 3. Dopamine likes unexpected surprises. Dopamine tries to pattern match even when there isn't a patter. Loss Aversion.Chapter 4. Meh.Chapter 5. Overthinking is dangerous.Rationalizing can hurt you -- the rational brain hijacks the mind, you start analyzing too closely instead of letting instinct and your emotions guide you. (e.g., think of a golfer -- at first, when you're beginning, it's good to analyze. but when you're a pro and what to do is already ingrained in you, analyzing too much just confuses you). ""They ignroe the wisdom of their emotions -- the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons -- and start reaching for things that they can explain.""Strawberry Jam Experiment -- students matched Consumer Reports preferences naturally, but when told to explain why, total mismatch.Energy drink experiment -- people think more expensive drinks are more effective.Experiment: subjects told to memorize 7 vs 2 digits. When walking down the hall, offered cake. People memorizing 7 digits took cake more often -- bc memorizing the digits drew cognitive resources away from the brain that normally conttrols emotional urges. Similarly, slight drop in blood sugar levels can inhibit self control, bc frontal lobes require energy to functionAnchoring effect - say last two digits of SSN, and then say what you're willing to pay.USE THIS!""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."" -- 2 grps of students given financial data. some less info (basically only prices), others given detailed data. students with no extra data performed better. similarly, guidance counselors given students data (interviews too) vs. given only gpaMORE INFORMATION ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER!Chapter 6. Psychopaths have a fundamental emotional disorder. The main problem seems to be a broken amygdala, the brain area responsible for aversive emotions like fear and anxiety. ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" Psychopaths commit violent crimes because their emotions never tell them not to; they have a rational lawyer inside their head, willing to justify any action (think of the following thought experiment: two siblings have sex safely (i.e., use protection) -- if ask people whether wrong or not, they will endlessly try to rationalize stupid reasons)So against standard views, morality depends on emotions. Psychopaths are the dispassionate judges.Harlow's experiment: ""If monkeys have taught us anything, it's that you've got to learn how to love before you learn how to live."" Isolated monkeys with no love develop disorders. they feel nothing, like psychopaths. Give monkeys two mothers -- a cloth mother, and a wire mother with milk (i.e., love vs food) -- monkeys prefer cloth mother, going to wire mother only to eatWe are designed to feel one another's pain, so that we're extremely distressed when we hurt others and commit moral transgressions. Evolutanio has programmed us to care about one another. Sympathy is one of humanity's most basic instincts, which is why evolution lavished so much attention on mirror neurons, the fusiform face area, and those other brain regions that help theorize about other minds. As long as a person is loved as a child and doesn't suffer from any developmental disorders, the human brain will naturally reject violence and make fair eoffers and try to comfort the crying child. Consider experiment: 6 monkeys trained to pull on chains to get food. 1 chain gets large amount of fav food, another gets small amount of less desirable food. monkeys learned to pull on the better chain. but then one day pulling on that chain painfully shocked another monkey. the orig monkeys stopped pulling on the chain.Chapter 7. Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the inf owith your conscious mind. Instead, go on holidy while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuitien then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best coice."
284,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,4,"Decision Making and cognitive development is a topic I enjoy reading about. Thinking about how we think is an important skill. Other books in this genre I have read include Group Think, Predictably Irrational, Talent Code, and Blink. While this covered some of the same ground and in some cases reviewed the same research, this was as good as any of the other books in the category. As Dumbledorf tells Harry Potter: we are defined by our decisions, not our abilities. Yet we don’t understand our own decision making process very well. Good decision making (particularly in times of Plato) has been equated to our ability to rely on logic and reason but current research shows we need to utilize our reason and our feelings/emotions together and know what to emphasize when. Other tidbits: the prefrontal cortex which integrates emotions into the decision making process is one of the last areas of the brain to fully develop which explains why a lot of teenagers exercise bad judgment. A study of rats with stimulated dopamine showed they literally were transfixed by bliss and died because they wouldn’t eat or sleep. The same applies to a crack addict who over stimulates his brain and loses interest in all other activity. To help the brain build decision making capability any surprise in the brain’s predicted outcome is elevated in the brain—a surprise circuit sounds an alarm and recalibrates. Unpredictable rewards or punishments are 4x more stimulating to neurons than a predicted reward or punishmentIntelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practiceNiels Bohr: “An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field”Mistakes should be carefully investigated and cultivated to help us recalibrate and learnHelp children view mistakes as ways to learn, not signs of stupidity and praise them for working hard, not being smart. Evidence shows a “hot hand” in basketball is a myth. A player who has made 3 shots in a row is less likely to make his next shot than then if he had missed 3 in a row. Loss aversion is powerful. Bad is stronger than good. That’s why it takes 5 kind comments to compensate for one critical comment. Sometimes our emotions lead to perceptual narrowing (reducing our perceived options as we cling to emotion not reason). Wag Dodge and men in fire in Montana. Fire is raging toward them. Instinct is to run but fire is moving faster than they can run. All perish except Dodge who stopped running and set a fire around him before the big fire reached him. This is a case of reason overriding emotion. A case where feelings trumped reason: Riley had feeling that a radar blip was an Iraqi missile when there was not a logical way to differentiate it from a US plane. His intuition had been refined after looking at radar regularly. Sometimes thinking too much causes us to override feelings and make bad decisions. When asked to rate good tasting jam people made better choices when they rated it without analyzing it. People who are more rational don’t perceive emotion less, they regulate it better. When people were given the price of wine they correlated their ratings with price even when the high prices were put on cheap wines. Psychopaths are very reasonable but have no feelings. Similarly, autistic people don’t regulate interactions based on feelings and lack ability to empathize with others. He cited the Stanford Marshmallow experiment with 4 year olds. The marshmallow test was a better predictor of SAT results than IQ tests. The kids who could regulate their emotions by distracting them selves (e.g. closing eyes) were successful. Partisans self censure data and conform it to their own beliefs. Given large inconsistencies, democrats and republicans both explain it away of their fellow party members and highlight it in the other party. Political commentators’ accuracy in predicting outcomes is lower than the average persons and inversely correlated to their confidence level. Hubris is our vice. Lincoln’s ability to tolerate dissent was an enormous asset. Routines element decision making and increase ability to focus on bigger decisions. When you are certain you are right you stop listening to those brain areas that say you might be wrong. Success: entertain competing hypotheses, remind yourself of what you don’t know, turn mistakes into educational events. CRM (cockpit resource management) is example of a group being more effective than an individual in decision making. "
285,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain,5,"Several years ago, I used to listen to hours of podcasts every week while sitting in an office creating employee schedules for Universal Studios. I especially loved podcasts involving books, authors and science. Although I have no idea which podcast I was listen to when I heard author Jonah Lehrer interviewed for his book, How We Decide, I remember hearing it made me immediately order his book from Amazon. I bought it and it has sat on my to-be-read shelf until I plucked it out last week when I was in the mood for non-fiction. Lehrer's How We Decide is a look at how the brain functions in the decision making process. He delves into which part of the brain takes over during certain types of decisions, particularly decisions that involve a flood of information. The book is part an analytical look at the science of decision making and part user manual. Lehrer provides concrete examples and sound reasoning as to which situations we should tune out or seek excess information. Lehrer explains how our brains can only hold a certain amount of information and sometimes an excess of options can hinder our ability to make the right choice. Sometime the right choice is going with your emotional or gut feeling, even if you can't readily explain why you feel that it's the right choice. Some of the case studies in the book are completely fascinating. In particular, Lehrer discusses patients with Parkinson's Disease who when on a specific medication, thirteen percent will develop a compulsive gambling disorder. I'm not going to give away anymore, as the case study begs to be read! Another study that was less shocking, but I feel very pertinent involved fifth graders who were given a test. After the test, half the kids were praised for ""being smart"" and the other half were praised for ""working hard"". The kids were then given an option between taking two additional tests. One would be much harder, at an advanced level and the other would be at their grade level. Most of the kids praised for working hard, decided to try the more challenging test and those praised for their intelligence, picked the easier one. The chapter featuring the fifth graders goes on to discuss a lack of self confidence and the problem with perception in our society. People want to be viewed an innately intelligent or talented, rather than someone who has to work hard. However, our brains are wired to learn from mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the learning process and when we grow from them, it's a good thing. Growing from mistakes actually creates intuition and makes us become experts on subjects. It gives us the powerful ability to make snap decisions.The abundance of information can sideline anyone, including doctors. Lehrer writes about the influence of MRI technology in creating a surge of back surgeries. Doctors were given MRI results from patients that revealed terrible spine and disc problems. However, many of these patients were not complaining of back problems or pain. The surgeries were being recommended from the MRI results, rather than listening to the patient. The New England Medical Journal recommended that doctors skip ordering MRI's for back problems, unless the patient is complaining.The MRI results reveal too much information, show disc problems that are likely common and age related, rather than something needing a surgery. My aunt has had several back surgeries in the last few years and although I know that she is in a lot of pain, this chapter made me reflect on the necessity of all of the invasive surgeries, especially as her problems still exist. Lehrer's book reminds me of that supplemental book that you would have in a college course. The ""fun"" read assigned alongside the primary text book. It's engaging and entertaining, but also densely packed with information. It's a book about thinking that will make you think, not a light summer read. It has so much information, that it begs to be read more than once and has many good take-away lessons. I definitely benefitted from How We Decide and I will take a pause the next time I'm confronted with a big decision. Lehrer's book taught me that the most important component of a big decision is knowing the best way to approach it.Please check out my blog for more reviews and musings."

(http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...) I found out about the plagiarism issues once I got onto Goodreads to review this book, and I felt somewhat justified in my irritation towards this book. My experience as a college teacher in China has given me an intense hatred of plagiarism, and I enjoy sharing real world examples of the perils of plagiarism with my students. This book might make my list of famous offenders this semester.Besides all the vastly different worldview conflicts I had (which I'll get to in a moment), I couldn't help feeling that I had heard all of this stuff before from reading Malcolm Gladwell's books. I guess the cover art also contributed to that feel, with its stark blank background and single image. That brings up another beef I have with this book! I kept anticipating a story about how we make choices regarding ice cream flavors, but alas, false advertising!However, what rankled me most was the unthinking assumption that humans evolved from primates. I know that that debate was not the point of this book, but the author tossed around the concepts of such flawed thinking so many times and in such a cavalier way that I kept thinking, ""Wow, people actually believe this crap?!""I was most annoyed by this excerpt, which I transcribed below:""Religious believers assume that God invented the moral code. It was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, a list of imperatives inscribed in stone. As Dostoevsky put it, 'If there is no God, then we are lost in a moral chaos. Everything is permitted.'But this cultural narrative gets the causality backwards. Moral emotions existed long before Moses. They are writ into the primate brain. Religion simply allows us to codify these intuitions, to translate the epics of evolution into a straightforward legal system. Just look at the Ten Commandments. After God makes a series of religious demands (Don’t worship idols and always keep the Sabbath), he starts to issue moral orders. The first order is the foundation of primate morality, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then comes a short list of moral adjuncts, which are framed in terms of harm to another human being. God doesn't tell us merely not to lie, he tells us not to bear false witness against our neighbor. He doesn't prohibit jealousy only in the abstract, he commands us not to cover our neighbors’ wife or slaves or ox or donkey. The God of the Old Testament understands that our most powerful moral emotions are generated in response to personal moral scenarios, so that’s how he frames all of his instructions. The details of the Ten Commandments reflect the details of the evolved moral brain. These innate emotions are so powerful that they keep people moral even in the most amoral situations.""Wow. Just wow. How can the author tag an oversimplified version of the Ten Commandments and a patronizing view of God into his book? These nods at belief seem so disingenuous since evolution is pushed throughout, which of course is in conflict with everything that the Bible says. To me it sounds like, ""Poor God, he did the best he could to help those human monkeys make a religion out of the moral instincts their brains want them to do anyways."" Humans are basically good? Hogwash.Though some of the anecdotes in this book were interesting, I felt like the conclusions the author drew at the end of them were trite and sometimes arrogant. I don't recommend this book to anyone, and if the publisher's recall has much effect, hopefully this book will be erased from public memory soon. Go read something by Malcolm Gladwell instead, and by all means, actually read and try to understand the Bible before sloppily trying to make it say what is convenient for your pop psychology book. "

288,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"Not surprisingly, How We Decide has a fair amount of overlap with other popular books about the mind including some that I have read (
Blink
, 
The Time Paradox
, and 
The Paradox of Choice
). However, despite an overlap in subject matter and in the studies cited, I feel like this book is among the better of these types of books.In addition to presenting conclusions based on psychological studies, Lehrer uses information we have gained from studying the brain to build a description of how decision making works. The main tension when making decisions is between the emotional brain and the rational brain. Actually, that is a simplification. Both systems consist of multiple systems which may, in turn, disagree with each other. On the other side of the coin, both the emotional brain are really part of the same system and influence each other. But as a mental model, this two part view of the brain is instructive.The details are interesting, but in the hopes of keeping things concise, I will cut to the chase. The emotional brain is good at taking in a lot of information and matching it against past experience. It's good for deciding personal preferences or making decisions in areas where you have a lot of experience. The rational brain is good at dealing with new experiences but can only take in a small amount of information. It's good at creating new solutions or making decisions when there are only a small number of factors to consider (perhaps as little as a dozen total across the possibilities). When they work well, these two systems help each other, with the emotional brain internalizing when decisions in certain contexts lead to good and bad outcomes and the rational brain deciding when something new needs to be tried. When either of these systems fails completely (as happens with some types of brain trauma), people become unable to function independently Those who lose rational brain functionality become unable to make considered decisions. Those who lose emotional brain functionality become unable to make decisions at all. Lehrer states in his conclusion that the most important thing you should take from this book is that you should think about thinking. This allows you to avoid stupid errors that arise from predictable brain errors (errors such as loss aversion). It also allows you to improve the working of your brain over time. Another key thing to take from How We Decide is the idea that certainty is self defeating if you want to use your brain effectively. Certainty quiets the internal dissent that your various brain parts generate and leads to bad decisions. As Lehrer says:The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs. We we start censoring our minds, turning of those brain areas that contradict our assumptions, we end up ignoring relevant evidence. ... But the certainty trap is not inevitable. We can take steps to prevent ourselves from shutting down our minds' argument too soon. We can consciously correct for this innate tendency. And if those steps fail, we can create decision-making environments that help us better entertain competing hypotheses. ...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. Good decisions rarely emerge from a false consensus.So spend some time thinking about thinking. "
289,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,5,"Bookwise, I’ve been on a neuroscience kick lately – they feel a lot like self-help books (which I have a soft spot for, wanting to improve myself) but with science and studies to back them up!My latest read is How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer, affectionately known (at least to me) as “The Ice Cream Book” since it has pictures of different flavored ice cream cones on the front.For a long time, people thought rationality and reason were what separated us from the animals, and that was what we used to decide pretty much everything. It turns out that is very, very wrong. We make emotional decisions all the time, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re skilled in a particular area, making a decision based on how you feel is usually a good idea. (an example: Tom Brady doesn’t have time to consciously decide whom to throw to, so he glances at each receiver and gets a “gut feeling”)The trick is knowing when to use emotion and when to use reason. One of the best examples (the author gives a lot of interesting examples ala Malcolm Gladwell) is Michael Binger, who won third place at the 2006 World Series of Poker. He’s played poker for long enough that after playing at a table for a little while, he can glance at the other players and instinctively know how to play the hand (whether to be aggressive or not). Actually, this part of the book reminded me of Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. (which I haven’t actually read) But Binger also uses reason to avoid making big mistakes right after losing a hand – it’s easy to get upset and your emotions can easily lead you astray.Another good example was a study known as the Iowa gambling task. (great name, no?) The setup is that the subject is given four (virtual) decks of cards with different amounts of money on them and asked to maximize their money. Two decks are “good” (many more good cards than bad) and the other two are “bad”. At first subjects pick more or less randomly, trying to figure out which decks are best, and after about 50 draws people generally stick with the good decks, although it takes around 80 draws before they can explain why. However, after about 10 draws people start getting emotional reactions – they get nervous when they’re about to pick from the bad decks! People with a dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (which is responsible for emotional decision-making) don’t get the nervous reaction, and never figure out which decks are good.One example I found amusing was choosing a strawberry jam. Some college students were given four unmarked containers of jam and asked to pick which was best – their choices lined up reasonably well with the reviews in Consumer Reports. (correlation of .55) However, when a different set of students were asked to choose the best and explain why, they preferred the worst jam to the best one! (correlation of .11) The theory is that when we have to justify our decisions, our rational brain kicks in and picks something to rank them on, like a chunky texture. But maybe the texture doesn’t really affect how good the jam is – it just sounds like it should.There are lots of fascinating examples in the book, and he concludes with a few principles on making decisions:– For simple problems (like choosing a can opener), use reason.– For novel problems (unfamiliar situations), also use reason.– Embrace uncertainty – being certain about a conclusion can easily blind you to new contradictory evidence.– You know more than you know – the “emotional brain” is much better at solving problems with many different variables, like choosing furniture or a car.– Think about thinking – be aware of whether you’re choosing based on reason or emotions; emotions can be great at certain types of problems but they’re easily fooled when it comes to others.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book – I’ve read it twice already! It’s available for borrowing if you’re interested."
290,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,2,"This book was very taxing to read since it took me forever to get through and my brain kept shouting, ""NO!"" at every scientific inconsistency.Writing style wise, the book is captivating. Lehrer uses lots of stories to connect the psychological ideas with real-life. He's a great storyteller. It's easy to read and very entertaining. I would've rated this book higher if it wasn't for his bad science. If you're not a big science person and would just like to enlighten yourself about decision-making, this may be a good book for you.Now, to explain the taxing of the book and my brain's reaction. I'm a psychology major, so I know many of the concepts that Lehrer is talking about. My brain just wants to facepalm itself every time he introduces a new idea. He takes an idea and then stretches it beyond its max, such that the idea is no longer valid. Let's take the submarine example. The man chose to signal an alert even though the enemy missile looked the same as an ally ship. Why? Lehrer claims it's his emotions. The truth is, it's the connections in his brain that has formed overtime from practice-and not emotions-that allow the man to make the right decision. Yes, it's mostly unconscious, but the fact is it's not an emotional decision. It's because of connections that have been established through past experiences.Let's take another example: chapter 7 ""The Brain is an Argument."" In this, Lehrer basically describes what social psychologists call the Confirmation Bias, but he never calls it that. It's a phenomenon due to the way the brain is structured and not an emotional response. Emotions may be a symptom of Confirmation Bias, but it's not the reason why people always support what they think is right. Many psychologists think that people use Confirmation Bias to increase their confidence and increase their confidence of their level of survival since theoretically you're more likely to survive if you're not experiencing a threat.What's funnier is that Lehrer says what every good scientist says, ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" yet he takes correlations and makes them into causation to support his ideas. He's using the Confirmation Bias, not emotional reasoning.I'm not sure what his definition of emotion is. It's not clearly defined. He quotes it as physiological symptoms (sweating, heartrate), as neurotransmitters (dopamine), and as neural structures in the brain (amygdala), as intuition or just some ""feeling"". He doesn't fully explain how all of these aspects are connected, basically just claiming that we're unconscious of it all. However, we can explain a good bit of our emotions (we know failing a task will make us feel miserable), so I don't think all of his claims are valid. The biggest problem with this book is that most of the research he quotes is still under investigation. We don't know enough about the unconscious and intuition to be able to say, ""Yes, this is how emotions work."" There are so many variables in humans that science hasn't been able to clearly classify emotions with strict definitions. To say that we can decide everything with ""feelings"" is preposterous because that word could mean so many different things. Sometimes, these ""feelings"" aren't just feelings, but our brains making connections that we aren't thinking about because we're not practicing meta-cognition (thinking about our thinking).To sum up his book in a more scientific way, we make decisions using experience from past events (connections between neurons formed due to learning and practice), meta-cognition, and neurotransmitters activating certain regions in our brains. None of these things fully explain emotions unless you think emotions are all biological and have no other components. However, emotions and decisions are more complex than what he claims."
291,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"Is making good decisions simply a matter of reason or logic, or can we use our emotions to make better decisions? Jonah Lehrer explores the research behind good decision-making in his book How We Decide. Lehrer peppers his book with gripping narratives detailing moment-by-moment situations where proper decision-making is crucial, even life-or-death. An airline crew has to land a plane having lost all navigational control. A Navy radar technician has to decide whether a radar blip is an enemy missile or a friendly aircraft. Kurt Warner, the New England Patriots’ quarterback, has less than 4 seconds to identify an open receiver and pass the ball before the pocket collapses. Through these second-by-second exchanges, Lehrer explains how people manage to make good decisions.Lehrer contends that the ancient Greek philosophers got it at least partially wrong. It is a mistake to assume that pure reason is the only thing that matters, and that the wild horses of our desires and passions must be tamed lest they lead us astray. Instead, he makes a convincing case that our “emotional brain” works with our “rational brain” to make better decisions than reasoning alone. Sometimes it is better to go with our gut-level feelings, even if we can’t always explain why. He backs up his argument with liberal references to research findings.A Formula for Good Decision-MakingLehrer prescribes a formula for how to make good decisions.1) Simple problems, particularly numerical problems, require reason. Some problems may seem simple but are actually complex. Picking a good-tasting strawberry jam requires evaluating many hard-to-define variables. Indeed, research demonstrates that deciding which strawberry jam tastes best by consciously thinking about its flavor, texture, etc. produces less satisfying choices than simply deciding which tastes best with no analysis.2) Novel problems also require reason. When running across a new situation, it can be useful to ask ourselves if we've run across a similar situation in the past. Our creativity can use past experience to apply to new and unexpected experiences.3) Complex problems require using our gut-level intuitions and hunches. For instance, when we decide to buy a car, we can be overwhelmed by the number of options and variables involved. Many times we know which car we want to buy, even when we can’t explain why. Going with our gut feelings in complex situations often produces more satisfactory results. Of course, buying a car on credit can also lessen the pain of purchasing a car we can’t afford, an emotional trap that the book also explores.The problem is that we often spend too little time analyzing simple problems, and too much time analyzing complex problems. So we struggle to rationalize that new car purchase until we talk ourselves out of what we really want. The Brain: Logic and EmotionsHow We Decide reviews the role of various parts of the brain, though it is not comprehensive. This leaves the reader with an introduction to brain function but with an incomplete understanding of it. Lehrer also shifts what he means by emotions and the emotional brain. Most people define emotions in terms of passions, feelings, and/or desires. Although Lehrer touches on this aspect of emotion, he most commonly refers to the emotional brain as the center of our subconscious hunches, intuitions, pattern identification, and even morality.SummaryNevertheless, How We Decide is an entertaining and breezy read, and Lehrer does a good job of making difficult-to-define concepts concrete and lucid, backed with extensive and solid research. Given the fuzzy nature of emotion and intuition, this is quite an achievement."
292,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,3,"How we Decide Another book that pokes holes into the notion that we deliberately decide things, or that our decisions are based on sound evidence instead of slight emotional distractions that we don't consciously notice. I must apologize that I read this, and didn't write the review right away. Why? Life was busy, which I hate to use or hear as an excuse because life is always busy (post college anyway) and we have to use our time deliberately. I was doing a couple other tasks which I deemed more important at the time, and long story short I snoozed on writing the review. Which means it's not as fresh in my mind, but, I'll say this. It's refreshing to know in an ever increasing data driven world, that the best decisions are a mix of reason and emotion. That intuition (guided by information) is the tried to try ultimate guide. The best chess players are a mix of computer algorithms and people. The best decisions involve reason and emotion. It's not head versus heart, it's head and heart. And that statement isn't some wishy washy hippie bullshit, it's grounded in scientific research. And data.  Quotes Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes we need to listen to our emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think. xvi When we are cut off from feelings, the most banal decisions became impossible. A brain that can't feel can't make up its mind. ..much of what we ""think"" is really driven by our emotions. 23 ""The madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason."" - GK Chesterton The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence – the ""smart"" compliment – is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. 53 Unpredictable rewards are typically three to four times more exciting, at least for dopamine neurons, than rewards that can be predicted in advance. 60 When a person travels more than one hour in each direction, he or she has to make 40 percent more money in order to be as ""satisfied with life"" as a person with a short commute. 145 The only way to counteract the bias for certainty is to encourage some inner dissonance. We must force ourselves to think about the information we don't want to think about, to pay attention to the data that disturbs our entrenched beliefs...when making decisions, actively resist the urge to suppress the argument. Instead, take the time to listen to what all the different brain areas have to say. 217 The different strategies used by poker players illuminate the benefits of having a mind capable of rational analysis and irrational emotion...the best poker players know when not to rely on math. 231 We often make decisions on issues that are exceedingly complicated. In these situations, it's probably a mistake to consciously reflect on all options, as this inundates the prefrontal cortex with too much data. ""The moral of this research is clear,"" Dijksterhuis says. ""Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice."" 237 "
293,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3195328-scott,3,"How We Decide is another book in a increasingly-popular genre that uses anecdotal examples to advance neurological, psychological or economic patterns. More than a few authors have attempted to exploit the genre since Freakonomics exploded a few years ago. This book is another in long line of this genre, which cultural critic Adam Hanft has referred to as “pattern porn.” I had high expectations for the book and its author, Jonah Lehrer, from reading his Frontal Cortex blog. Throughout the book, Lehrer uses many examples that are already familiar to anyone who has read other books in this now-familiar genre. Examples include the propensity of wine experts to choose cheaper wines in blind tests; how experiment subjects based purchasing decisions on seemingly random items such as their social security numbers; and numerous others. He also reviews much familiar territory in behavorial economics/social psychology/neuroscience such as loss aversion, the anchoring effect, and the placebo effect. One of the early messages of the book is that we should embrace emotion in our decision-making. This is contrary to the popular notion that emotions get in the way of “rational thinking.” Emotions are actually critical to decision making. We are paralyzed without it. That is why Tom Brady identifies the right receiver in milliseconds; why a soap opera director can identify the “it” factor in actor rehearsals, and why a radar technician can distinguish an enemy missile from a friendly jet just by a literal blip on the radar. The use of emotions as decision enhancement is valid technically from a physiological perspective. Lehrer deftly explains in an understandable manner the role of dopamine receptors as emotional decision makers. But, he tries very hard to maintain that ignorance is bliss. Lehrer contends Plato and his Enlightenment successors such as Decartes, Rousseau, and Jefferson (on this side of the pond) had it all wrong to promote reason over emotion. Reason is a blunt instrument suited only for the simplest of tasks. It is like a calculator – useful, but limited. And, there is such a thing as too much analysis.EXCEPT – “Novel problems” also require reason, as Lehrer states toward the end of the book. He concedes that “intelligent intuition (emotion)” is the result of deliberate practice. So, emotions and gut feelings work well as long as you practice at it. But, then again, you cannot over think things either. In short, emotions are great usually, reason is great sometimes, but both can mislead. My main issue with the theme is that there really is no theme. He boasts the triumph of emotions over reason for the first part of the book. Then, he explains how emotions can lead us into traps. So, sometimes reason is good. But, then again, reason is limited.The main takeaway from the book is “Think about how you think” as Lehrer states at the end of the book. And, from that perspective, Lehrer succeeds. The anecdotes have been used and re-used. There is some lack of cohesion in the overall development of the themes. But, the book will make you think about how you think."
294,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509681-khalid-ismail,4,"This book was very informative despite all the writer's plagiarism issues I read about online.  The book deeply illustrates the biological processes which occur in our brains when we are tying to made a decision. It's important to know that there's no such "" a secret recipe"" in decision-making, as Jonah Lehrer indicates.  When we encounter a situation in which we will be deciding what to do, we should find a balance between using our prefrontal cortex, where we generate our rational thoughts, and our emotional brain, which is known for impulsivity. Relying on your prefrontal cortex doesn't mean we're going to make the wise decision, and that simply because our brain isn't always reliable as we might think. Our brain, as we all experience, deceives us sometimes to draw a conclusion that we think is right, but we end up making a mistake. The reason, according to Lehrer, is that we have to consider our emotional brain while making a decision and trust our gut feelings since our rational thoughts aren't always rational !.  Lehrer also introduces some biological organs in our brain, such as OFC, the orbitofrontal cortex, which generates our emotions and associates them with our thoughts we have in our brains. Also, Lehrer mentions the insulla, the part of the brain that generates negative emotions. Also, there were some psychological concepts were introduced in the book, such as loss aversion, which is different behaviors we approach due to various question frames someone tells us. Moreover, FFA, fusiform face area, is a region in the brain where we maintain familiar peoples' faces. Those who have autism experience very week activation in that region.  Regarding moral decisions, our emotional brains determines if the decision is moral or not, since it thinks of other peoples' feelings and mirrors the emotions of everyone around us. At the same time, our rational brain, the prefrontal cortex, gives us the reason to think this way. I think this is very pertinent to the philosophical concept, Utilitarianism, I learnt in philosophy 101. One of the most interesting facts I learnt from this book was the competition between our insulas and NAccs. Our NAcc is the part of our dopamine neurotransmitter that is highly activated when we get excited to but things at the mall or the grocery stores. Many shopping centers place their electronics sections, such as TV's and laptops are the entrance to get our NAcc activated and pacify our insula. Even more, the stickers we all see on many products in shopping center actives our NAcc to enforce us to buy while the actual price wasn't reduced a penny !. to summarize the book's main point in a nutshell, according to my understanding, is we need to use our prefrontal cortex that deals with data, facts, spreadsheets, instructions, etc and our emotional brain that tells us a certain decision is the right one. If we end up making a mistake, our brains are always rewiring themselves in each experience we go through. Eventually, we will gain enormous experience and finally we can highly depend on our emotional brain. "
295,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely,3,"This book was incredibly fascinating. So fascinating that I actually finished the book and then immediately went back and re-read portions of it. This book would easily have gotten a five star review from me, except for one huge flaw that is big enough to decrease the rating by at least two stars.Lehrer starts the section of the book focusing on morality and how we treat other people by mentioning that psychopaths normally start by torturing animals (he uses John Wayne Gacy as an example). He then goes on to describe that psychopaths are able to hurt and torture people and animals because their emotional brain is essentially broken - basically their amygdala doesn't work so psychopaths don't feel bad when other people feel bad.Lehrer then continues throughout the section describing how normal, non-psychopathic people will often go to great lengths to avoid hurting others, even at somewhat of an injury to themselves. At one point he notes that humans are so anxious to connect with, and not hurt other humans, that they often imagine that stuffed animals or computers have similar feelings.Lehrer then makes the inexplicable choice of ending this section of the book by describing the savage, and brutal ""experiments"" by the ""scientist"" Harlow. Harlow was supposedly attempting to study how social isolation would affect growing children by breeding monkeys and then immediately removing them from their mothers and locking them in cages alone for the rest of their lives (and other more sadistic variations of the same experiment). Not surprisingly these monkeys would start tearing out their fur or biting off their hands. Later, when exposed to other monkeys they were unable to deal with them in a normal manner and would often start abusing them. Supposedly Lehrer discusses Harlow's ""experiments"" to show that humans and animals will end up unable to cope with other humans/animals when they are not raised in caring environments. However, he at no point attempts to clarify why Gacy's early animal torturing is a sign of his psycopathy but Harlow's animal ""experiments"" (which as described in this book at least are significantly more brutal than Gacy's torture) don't make him a psychopath.It would have been extremely interesting if Lehrer had included the Harlow example and then later gone on to describe how humans - who supposedly care so much about others that sometimes imagine stuffed animals or computers have similar emotions - are able to remove animals or humans of other races / religions / nationalities/ etc. from their circle of morality. However, he did not and I realize that the neuroscience to describe this phenomenon may not exist at this point. Regardless, Lehrer included mention of Harlow's useless experiments as though they were a completely normal and moral thing to do without reconciling them to the earlier section of his chapter on morality. And in a chapter that exclusively deals with morality this is a huge and inexcusable oversight."
296,0618620117,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,3,"There are a number of popular press books that review the state of cognitive science and end up citing the same research, using the same examples, telling the same stories, forming the same conclusions. It’s information worth rehashing, but is rehash nonetheless. Because Lehrer is a journalist, not a scientist, I expected more of the same. He did go over some of the same information, but he also did something new to me that made this book worth reading. He did a decent job of trying to close the intellect-emotion circle, reconciling the paradoxical relationship between pure reason and emotional instincts. I’ve heard a number of authors pay homage to the “intelligence” of intuitive thought—things like gut instinct, intuition, reflexive responses—all stuff I tend to distrust. Yes, intuition has many successes and can outperform reason at times, even at critical times. But these authors make little effort to explain the phenomenon. It ends up being presented as a kind of faith-based science, a miracle of our brilliant neural anatomy. My “intuition” is to reject that and I think poorly of books like Blink that make such a submission. But Lehrer tries to get behind the science that explains intuition. He also discusses how reason practiced in the complete absence of emotion can be impotent. Emotion sometimes carries with it motivation and desire and a call to action, while reason can be timelessly pensive and coldly indifferent. Reason can also turn out to be too exhaustive a process, the cost of which can exceed the benefit when dealing with minor decisions, or major decision with short deadlines. But there are two major problems with intuition, only one of which Lehrer addresses. He is clear that intuition can lead us down the wrong path because it is subject to an array of cognitive biases. What he doesn’t discuss is that intuition is an attractive nuisance—it’s enticing because it’s so easy. Seat-of-the-pants decision-making saves us the effort of having to think out a problem, leaving us all the more susceptible to cognitive biases. In his brilliant essay Solitude and Leadership, William Deresiewicz said, “I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. …I need time to think about it… to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing.” Lehrer attempts to tidy up the contradiction between reason and emotion by recommending that we listen to our instincts but that we also scrutinize them and test them for biases, and that we also recognize the limitations of reason. So Star Trek’s Mr. Spok had it all wrong. He should not have suppressed his human side, but embraced it. …But, if he were perfectly logical, wouldn’t he have recognized that and acted more human? Isn’t it purely rational to factor in some degree of irrationality into our most rational thoughts? The circle remains unclosed."

A central claim in the book is that emotional feeling can be a really important in good decision making if you understand what's happening.Lehrer's claim is that dopamine neurotransmitters in your head do really well at recognizing patterns in a massively parallel background-processing fashion. They are what give you a ""gut"" feeling or instinct. If you train them well, you can take advantage of this rather than relying on your limited prefrontal cortex. This is the reason that quarterbacks can make good decisions with 300+ pound guys about to take them down (e.g. well trained dopamine feelings).Ideally, one should use your prefrontal cortex to gather information and process it into a format that can be efficiently used by the unconscious parallel mind that gives you emotions. This background processing can occur when your prefrontal cortex is otherwise idle (leading to things like ""AHA!"" moments when taking a shower).Some random things from the book:* Welcome dissenting opinions, it'll probably lead to better decisions (cf. Lincoln's cabinent)* Lehrer implies that psychopaths are extremely ""rational"", but lack emotional capability to understand the feelings of others. This can lead to horrific consequences.* Recognize what you don't know (i.e. confident political pundits are usually wrong more often than less-confident ones that admit their mistakes)* Recognize that you know more than you know (e.g. your intuition is very real if trained well)* Use your pre-frontal cortex for simple decisions (e.g. ""simple problems require reason""). If you're buying a commodity, it's ok to reason about price.* When overwhelmed with data, review the basics with your pre-frontal cortex, but then let your dopamine intuition take over.* ""Novel problems also require reason"" - that is, don't always trust your gut/emotional feelings on new scenarios because the pattern recognizing dopamine transmitters haven't been trained on it.* Think about your thinking (e.g. are your emotions being hindered by loss-aversion? Your mind will tend to want to filter out things that don't agree with its preconceived notion of what something is; are you subconsciously doing that?)One complaint I had with the book is that the author seemed to be confident making assertions along the lines of ""your brain has evolutionary design flaws that you need overcome."" I think it's still a case that the neuroscience field is still young and has more to learn. Overall, I enjoyed the ""how"" discussion but sort of ignored the ""why."" Who knows.. maybe I'm being irrational :)"

Perhaps I have reached the end of new information about human decision making, at least as it exists in popculture book form. Maybe I'll have to break down and start reading psychology journal articles. In any case, this book did not add anything new to my understanding of human decision making. Basically, people make decisions in numerous ways. We have emotional reactions and rational thought. We can and should think about how we make decisions and what our biases might be. This isn't new (or news) or at least shouldn't be. This didn't go into the details of how evolution fine tuned our emotional minds to make decisions why we are so attuned to other people. It didn't go into how to get to the level of being an expert or what goes into making the emotional mind an expert; if you want that read Outliers: The Story of Success. I did learn a couple of amusing things about myself though. There is an experiment presented in the book that gauges emotional/rational decisions by presenting a scenario about incest and if what happened was immoral. My first reaction was ""yuck, but not immoral"" and apparently I'm very odd. That yuck reaction made most people decide it was immoral. Fair enough, but I was in a heavy minority. The other thing that I had a reaction to was the descriptions of the monkey raising experiments (you know the ones. motherless monkeys, much sadness). I have read about those experiments more than once and still my reaction was how horrible humans are and how much we deserve a http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/ Rise of the Planet of the Apes style revolution.This book is a good introduction to human thought and decision making. However, it is not as explanatory or challenging as some of the other books written on the subject. In all, its not a bad book, its just at the bottom of the list of much better ones."

Changed review to 1 star because who wants to read a bunch of made up crap. Will NOT be reading his other books. Forbes writes a great article at http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffberco... and wikipedia says: "" He has published three books, two of which, Imagine and How We Decide, were withdrawn from the market by publishers after it became known that Lehrer had fabricated quotations. That led to his resignation from his staff position at The New Yorker following disclosures that he had recycled earlier work of his own for the magazine; later investigation at Wired.com, where he had previously worked, found instances of recycled content and plagiarism. He was fired from that position as a result.""____________________________Really like it. reminded me of outliers- like how they think if go deeper. Esp having to study and learn from mistakes. have to find summary since heard on audio. But pretty much, brain can process ~7 things at a time, but our 'feels' reflect subconscious that can process more. So once you 'master' a subject, you should go with feeling or you'll choke. But if you only go with feelings, it will fail you. around and around~ balance is the best- use both, never discount something because it's not likely, and you can make better decisions.-Simple problems require reason. (like an old calculator vs emotions for fancy computer)-Novel problems require reason- How does your past experience help solve this problem?Are these feelings rooted in experience or are they a haphazard impulse? If problem unprecedented, then emotions CANNOT help you. however people in good moods are significantly better at solving hard problems that require insight than those who are cranky and depressed. -Embrace Uncertainty- Otherwise so confident you disregard evidence that contradicts conclusions. Always entertain competing hypotheses. remind yourself what you don't know. Models and theories can be undone by unpredictable events. (tell me what you know, what you don't know then what you think. keep them separate)-You know more than you know. emotional brain especially useful at helping us make hard decisions. Tuen mistakes into educational events. Benefit from experience even when not aware of benefits.Becoming an expert takes time and practice. but once you dev expertise in a particular area, it's important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. ***-Think about thinking-whenever you make a decision, be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. study brain at work, listen to the arguments inside your head. (steer clear of stupid errors- can't avoid loss aversion unless you know that the mid treats losses diff than gains. the brain can always improve itself. tomorrow. "
