0,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/630170-lynne,3,"This was an interesting book. The authors review some interesting research on how infants learn in the first years of life. If it weren't for Chapter 5, I would have rated it higher. You can skip this chapter if you read the book. All this chapter does is repeat the same studies over and over (and over) again and make this really weird drawn out comparison of babies to computers and scientists that doesn't even make sense half the time."
1,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5170966-tracy-lowe,5,"This book is an excellent introduction to understanding child development. The authors take the time to remind readers that although babies are individuals. Babies have perceptions about the world—they are constantly absorbing information and analyzing and interpreting it to draw their own conclusions. The authors take the time to clearly explain the thought process and how they acquire knowledge. Plenty of case studies and anecdotal evidence make the science of infant brain development accessible and easy to understand. The book follows a logical path starting with background information about the different views of infant development over the years. The first chapters then describe what children know about people, things and language. The final half of the book addresses what scientists have learned about children’s minds and brains before a concluding chapter that puts the book into context by addressing ways which this research has been applied and also by suggesting further directions.I would recommend this book to both parents and professionals. Parents will find the book enlightening as a way of understanding what their baby knows about the world and how they are learning this. Professionals will find helpful theories, research and explanations which can underline their practice and further the field of infant development. This book is an excellent resource for both parents and professionals."
2,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/946659-andi,4,"My overall impression of this book is a favorable one. The information was relevant, easily digested, and had snippets of humor interjected here and there. The resources used to compile this book were extensive and credible. The notes on the material were comprehensive. The first chapter dealt mainly with the history of the study of children, dating back to early philosophers like Plato, Socrates, and Meno. The chapter made me quite nostalgic for my philosophy classes. I think I'm much better equipped as a 30-year old mother to debate such topics as the Other World problem and the External World problem than I was as an 18-year old college freshman. Also presented in the history of developmental theory are Locke, Piaget (who I did not know was a child genius), Freud, Skinner, and Vygotsky. It's quite interesting to see the progression of thinking about thinking (learning) condensed into such a small timeline. We really have come a long way!Chapters two, three, and four all deal with what children know about people, things, and language. The general consensus at this time seems to be that children come with innate knowledge of some things, have the ability to learn others, and are surround by adults who seem to innately want to teach them. It seems like common sense, but for years it actually wasn't. These chapters briefly touched on various syndromes that seem to involve some sort of breakdown in the pre-programming that children seem to have. The real gem in this section came from the discussion about language learning and development being influenced by region and environment. As children develop new ways of thinking, they develop new was to communicate these thought processes. For example, when a child learns the concept of failure, he/she also develops ways to communicate this, sometimes putting a word or a phrase into multipurpose use (like calling all animals with four feet ""doggie""), which brings us to this passage...American babies use [...] uh-oh to describe failures, while the babies in the Oxford villas used the more genteel oh dear (although one British baby did briefly but memorably say oh bugger).Chapters five and six deal with the specific topics of children's minds and brains. A lot of this information was not new to me, and some of it was even recycled information from earlier in the book (though I will grant that it was tied in with new-to-the-book concepts). The information was very easy to understand, partially because it was explained well (though talking about how computers works makes my brain want to explode) and in part because the information provided was very superficial and lacked a lot of detail. Again, it was at the very least good for a chuckle...For most grown-ups, for most of history, that learning [responsibility-free childhood learning] may have largely stopped when we reached maturity and turned to the more central evolutionary business of the four f's (feeding, feeling, fighting, and engaging in sexual reproduction).Predictably, the last chapter was a call for more study as well as the reasons why more study is justified. Basically, it let the reader finish the book with a warm fuzzy.I’m happy to have read this book, and it will keep its place on my bookshelf. It’s a good starter-book for someone interested in child development. There are certainly more detailed books available, but this is a good appetite-wetter."
3,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88821262-ben-houge,5,"This book is so awesome! Everyone with a baby should read it, the sooner the better.First amazing thing is the science. The book discusses three main problems that kids have to figure out: the Other Minds problem (that there are other, autonomous people in the world to interact with), the External World problem (how sensory information gets translated into a coherent representation of our physical environment), and the Language problem (how language is acquired). There are three main tools put forward that help children figure these things out: innate knowledge they are born with, a phenomenal capacity to learn, and adults who are hardwired to help them learn through the basic interactions of caregiving.There's a pervasive metaphor throughout the book about how kids' brains are like computers. I guess some might find this analogy somewhat overstated, but I loved the way it totally resonated with the model of intelligence set forth in Marvin Minsky's The Society of Mind.This book was a joy to read not only because of the information it contains, but also because it's extremely well written, and the authors don't hesitate to drop in literary or artistic references, an epigraph from Wordsworth, allusions to Juan Gris or Vermeer or Jane Austin, an interpolation of Blake's ""dark, Satanic mills."" It's refreshing to read writing about science that assumes a certain level of intelligence and cultural literacy on the part of the reader.In the past few years I've heard intermittent noise (mostly from design grad students, I think?) about the idea of ""artresearch"" (often stylized thusly as one word), and I've always objected to the notion that this is some new concept or frontier on the grounds that what serious, dedicated artists have always done is very much like the scientific method: have a hunch, try out an idea, evaluate the results, tweak it in the next piece... This book makes that link clear (and showing how it goes both ways, that scientists are also engaged in the same ""ecstatic enterprise"" as poets) and also ties it to the ways that babies are constantly conducting experiments on the world around them. Maybe one caveat is that this book (the first edition, which is the one I read) is from 1999, and the newer edition (under the name ""How Babies Think: The Science of Childhood"") is from only two years later. I'd be curious to know what's happened in the interim, so now I'm very curious to read some more recent works by the authors. References to things like speech recognition and machine learning as faraway goals are were the age of the book shows the most.There was one passage that moved me to tears (about how our brains are wired to those of our progeny in a link that persists beyond our deaths), and by the end of the book I had goosebumps contemplating the grand enterprise of culture as it is conveyed through the generations. This is the only book that I can think of recommending to new parents, but really I recommend it to everybody!"
4,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/412789-anastasia,1,"I was sorely disappointed by this book. I had heard a lot of people raving about; but when I think about it, I don't remember if the raves came from child-free people or from parents. I thought this would be an important book for me, as a parent, to read. My impression of it, however, was that it was written by college professors who wanted a light, fun, superficial, yet scientific, quick read, pseudo-textbook to use with their undergrads. The examples of children and children's behavior were either limited to experiments or were phrased in that vague, over-generalizing way often used by people who don't have children or who had them so long ago they can only remember the generalities.Still, I guess it was revolutionary in 1999, when this book was published, to assert that babies, newborns even, could actually think! I found this assertion obvious in 2007, having had 21 months of getting to know my son and having read a fair number of parenting books. But maybe that's just me?I did like the information on page 38 about two year olds' need to test conflict, not for the sheer sake of it, but to understand it. Chapter 5, comparing human minds to computers, was incredibly boring, and to me, absolutely demeaning. I am not a computer, my brain is not a computer. I don't believe using a human-created object such as a computer, is a valid way to look at or understand the human brain (or mind) and I find examples comparing thinking to using computer programs trite and insulting. Again, perhaps just me.If you've read anything by William and Martha Sears, any homebirth-focused book, any modern child development book (except maybe Baby Wise), then there is no need for you to waste your time with the Scientist in the Crib."
5,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735686-alison,4,"I really liked this explanation of how babies learn and the scientific experiments that people do to them to determine this. It covers how we learn language and that the other person is different from you and one other topic that I've forgotten. The majority of the book was fascinating and made babies so much more understandable. (There's a reason they mimic your gestures. There's a reason they can make all kinds of sounds.) The last chapter was a long-winded conclusion which just restated all of the previous interesting information. If you have no time, just read the last chapter and if you have more time, read the rest and skip the last chapter."
6,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7143957-stuart-macalpine,4,"An interesting book about the way children's understanding of the world develops in the first few years and indeed months of life. Some fascinating insights, for example that very young babies identify objects primarily by their trajectory and even if they change shape or form behind a screen and a tractor comes out as a rabbit, they will continue to assume it is the same object that is travelling at the same speed and on the same trajectory as when it went in, and the fact that this changes as babies begin to categorise objects differently. Also very interesting about babies' proficiency with object classification versus action classification depending on the grammatical structure of the language they learn early on.I found the presence of a rather strong ethnocentrism in the asides and anecdotes distracting."
7,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88489-viola,3,"The Scientist in the Crib: What Early Learning Tells Us About the Mind has a great premise – that babies are a lot smarter and much more cognitively capable than previously thought. The three co-authors of this book explore and develop this main premise by first introducing the historical assumptions about babies and then contrasting that with research within the field of developmental psychology for infants, which started around the 1970s. The research, as they report, consistently paints a picture of very intelligent human beings deciphering the new world around them. And the authors do not hide their utter and complete awe of babies. Great premise. I buy it already. I don’t need to be convinced of it.But, for a book that has “scientist” in its title and that begins by touting itself as a book about science, there is actually very little science presented. All conclusions of the research is presented in general terms with zero data, as if the conclusions were just accepted as fact with no variation, nuance, or controversy. That isn’t science. I’m not accusing the authors of making up the conclusions or of the facts not being backed up by the appropriate scholarly articles. Indeed, the notes and references sections are quite extensive. But in the text of the book, there is no presentation or discussion of the results of experiments. For example, one of the results presented early on tells us that babies can distinguish their mother’s voice and prefer it. Well, is this universal? Is the result that 100% the babies tested turned towards their mother’s voice over a stranger? What was the sample size? Are there competing theories to explain the same behavior? Is preference solely determined by heads turning? When was this study done? What progress has been made since then? Is this a generally accepted fact in the field because it has been successfully replicated? And that’s just the start of my questions.The book is organized into 7 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the general premise of the book and introduces the three main problems of babies: (1) the problem of Other Minds, (2) the problem of the External World (i.e., Things), and (3) the problem of Language. Then the next three chapters elaborates on each of these topics in turn. That gives us a total of 4 chapters. Next comes the worst chapter ever – Chapter 5. What in the world were the authors thinking in writing this awful chapter? And what kind of editor would allow it to remain? The chapter repeats the previous chapters and then goes into a bizarre comparison of scientists to babies. As in scientists are like babies. What?!? No! It’s absurd. It’s as if the authors are so enamored of babies that they want to force their adult square pegs into the babies round hole. It doesn’t work, no matter how much you try or desire it.The last two chapters, thankfully, return to sanity. Chapter 6 offers a deeper understanding of the brain, how it works, and how it gets wired. Quite interesting. And Chapter 7 concludes by touching upon policy implications. Reasonable enough.All in all, I can’t really say that I recommend this book. In addition to all the above problems, having been written in 1999, surely the information is dated and new research has cropped up. I’m glad that the authors are arguing in favor of the awesome cognitive abilities of babies. I agree with that. But I need a more scientific discussion, especially for a book that purports to be about science. I got more statistics out of a potty training book. Just a mere how-to book reported statistics like the average age of boys and girls being potty trained and average times of how long it took and the percentage of boys and girls potty trained by age 4."
8,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63302832-christine-kenney,2,"Picked this up at the suggestion it could allay future parental fears that we were not providing an enriching, hyper-structured experience for our infant. There were about 10 pages devoted to this topic in the final chapter (chasing an alarming chapter about developmental learning windows and neural connections atrophying if not sufficiently stimulated). It could have been the version I was reading, but the remainder of the book read like it was written by a 3 author committee that couldn't quite align on who their target audience was (machine learning researchers looking for biological analogs? parents? evolutionary biologists?) and valued conflict avoidance too much to identify and agree to rewrite the weaker sections. "
9,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/229763-jules,3,"This book is nearly 15 years old, and it felt that way to me; having read other books on infant development lately, I found it a less informative repeat of other information I've read elsewhere. I did enjoy some of the studies referenced, like how infants interpret movement and common first words. Sometimes the authors seemed to be too self-referential, and entertaining themselves with their own anecdotes or theories (like the exhausting ""scientist as child"" chapter). While it was a reasonable overview, I'd probably recommend a book like ""Einstein Never Used Flash Cards"" over this one."

12,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78089723-joe-flynn,5,"Lucid and illuminating despite its relative age as a science book. 4.5 stars. The general hypothesis is that babies learn quite like scientists do, or rather scientists remember how to think like babies! It plays out well, we see how babies encounter and overcome serious conceptual hurdles, the problem of other minds, that the world exists outside of subjective experience, and not just that sounds are words but that words have meanings. Doing this by making observations, predictions, theory building, and crucially adjusting or reprogramming these based on new data via a positive feedback circuit.We also have solid theory building, notably the idea that we evolved a drive that takes pleasure from explanations of the world, from working things out. Paired with the 'pain' of confusion. This giving us a long term evolutionary advantage. I say science book but I must add there is plenty of excellent and well written philosophy here too, it is explained that one of the authors studied philosophy at Oxford before persuing developmental psychology, it shows. The strongest sections (see the sections on language) seemed authored by Alison Gopnik. I see she also wrote 'the philosopher in the crib' not surprising and I'm sure also great! She writes well for the New Yorker too. This is not a guide for raising children though it has helped me understand them more. Adding priceless depth to the little things each day. There are ingenious experiments that dispell common myths and break new ground. The sections on language even helped me with my French studies! The text is speckled with some astounding facts about babies brains! Truly fascinating.The popular analogy of the brain as computer is used well here. In fact I was recommended this book by an AI researcher, the sections on AI remain prescient and well thought out even 20 years later. Brilliant to see both the progress (in some narrow fields) and the lack of it due to the hard issues babies solve so quickly! Interested to see the authors thoughts here now.There are funny and touching anecdotes, plus an impassioned section on what matters in child development, though this also touches on the time the book is from - dating it to the Clinton administration. I'm sure new data and findings have pushed the field forwards greater heights, with some of it probably from the authors. Small but unavoidable issue. I would have took half a star off for this but I am compelled to add it back on for an excellent take down of post modernism."

Really should help understanding the why behind certain actions and mannerisms Jensen exhibits throughout the first 3-4 years of life. Lots of it is skimmable but the dozen or so things to remember are worth the read.Last chapter has a lot of cool points about the development of the neural network in all humans. The young mind is able to grasp and sponge so much more than even the teen and especially the adult. Instagrammed the major points. A good summary of them from another reviewer:Some of the highlights:-It turns out their brains are firing up twice as intensively than our poor adult brain. Hence, the constant amazement. -Kids will learn foreign language without forced constraints or patterns of their mother tongue, if they do it until around the age 7. They will not have an accent if they learn it by puberty.-One year olds and alike are completely influenced by parents' choices - when we say that something is tasty (even if it reeks), kid trusts us, and vice versa. Beware, this paradise ends soon.-The terrible twos are not exclusively terrible - they are beginning to understand that other people are different from them and tend to like different things. So they elope on a mission to see what things exactly and how much. And ""no"" doesn't mean anything to them for some time.-First time I've heard about Williams syndrome, the opposite of Autism in some respects.-""Motherese"", or the semi-moronic language which parents use to talk to their kids is actually a useful thing (slow, repetitive, full of emotion), damn it.-Oh, and playing Mozart to your toddler doesn't do shit.

14,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6483794-amy,4,"It is often very hard for me to read a book on a subject which I am currently studying or otherwise working in as a fun read or as a side book for entertainment. It's difficult to enjoy a topic or find new things to seek out independently regarding the field in which one works when it is a part of one's everyday life and strife (but don't get me wrong...I love what I do). However, this book was an exception to this rule. Given to me as a suggested read by a fellow colleague, I found that this book was not only highly enlightening about infant development but also a breeze to read. This was NOTHING like the dense material I am used to reading in my graduate and undergraduate studies but rather easy and written for the lay person audience in describing the complex nature of brain development while still discussing important research. The flow of this book was simply incredible and made the topic of brain development, a typically un-reader-friendly topic, very digestible. I would highly recommend for anyone who wants to learn about early development, whether educated professional, curious learner, or parent to pick up this book and take in the beauty and knowledge that the authors have to offer."
15,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13899100-dorankagmail-com,3,"I read this book while my wife was pregnant with our first child. This book contains comprehensive and useful insights from decades of studying the brain and mind of babies. It does a good job of explaining the experiments ran, and making sense of the results.I was hoping this would contain more useful information for how to aid the development of my baby. It does have some of that, but there are less tips in this area than I would have liked. It does have very interesting information about how brains develop.My main take away is that evolution has made parental instincts perfect for aiding the development of baby's brain. Even 'coo coo'ing at babies is useful because it allows the babies to see the mouth movements that produce that sound and reproduce them. Also, if a baby doesn't hear certain sounds within the first few years it becomes very difficult to learn languages with those sounds. For example, Mandarin and Japanese contain sounds not used in English, so if a young child hears those sounds early on it will be easier for them to learn those languages."

As I was completely ignorant of the field, it was very interesting for me to learn how developmental psychologists set up experiments for babies, and what they have found about early learning. Authors' main thesis that babies iteratively update their understanding of the world through observations and interactions with people, and that such a learning process is very similar to the research process of scientists, are quite amusing. Authors were not so ambitious, however, and the book does not extend much beyond this thesis, which was a little bit disappointing to me; this book just contains about 200 pages, and only handful of experimental results are discussed. They also insert jokes and their anecdotes time to time, which were mildly distracting, but understandable for a casual book."

Learned that babies brains are capable of learning super quickly, and that our knowledge of baby learning is fairly nascent, with the field only beginning to take off in the '70s. The studies on language adoption stood out, where children <1 are able to pick up phonemes across languages easily, and there is a decline after. A few other random studies were interesting, like how when a baby is 3 you can teach them something, and then ask them right after how they knew a fact and they genuinely just believed they knew it all along. Would recommend if you want a somewhat meandering collection of studies with the messaging of ""babies learn a lot and we have a lot to learn about them"". "

If you have a newborn it is an interesting skim but I found the angle they took throughout the book a bit lacking. I think it’s a product of its time (published in 1999) as the core content is quite good. Nonfiction books of the 90s and early 00’s all tend to be stodgy and drab. 2 out of 5 for the general audience, 3 out of 5 if you are on parental leave and want a well researched, skimmable read about your newborn.There was a fascinating thread throughout the book that as women entered science in the 70’s this field emerged. #Diversity in the workplace truly unlocked a whole new field of study and knowledge!

Given that it was written in 1999, the information is, I'm sure, a little dated, but in general it seemed like an accurate account of how children learn, at least according to my limited experience with children. Most of the book demonstrates the fact that nature and nurture are both important factors in early development, it's not just one or the other. In the last chapter the authors touch on how their discoveries could be used to inform policy decisions regarding young children, parents and careers. I felt that this should have been a more in-depth discussion, but other than that I enjoyed the book. Probably I'll look around for some more recent books on this subject, since it's so pertinent to my current life."

This is definitely not a guidebook how to maximize the babies brainpower.Some good bits to remember:- for the first months babies eyes could focus only ~30cm, anything else that is further gets blurry.- 1 year olds trust parents blindly, they read from their faces and voices how they should react.- 2 year olds start to learn that different people have different likes/dislikes and rules, they start testing it, where are the boarders, the aim is not to misbehave but to learn, in a sense they are learning also the concept of conflict.- babies actually like baby talk from grownups, because it's easier to grasp - it's slower, repetitive, simpler, with better pronunciation and usually also it sounds bit more melodic. Actually when tested with unknown foreign language grownups also tend to consider it as more soothing.- until 6 months time babies grasp all the languages the same way, but after 6 months language specifics take over, firstly they start to recognise language specific pronunciations, around 12 months they start forming words. Kids will learn foreign language without forced constraints or patterns of their mother tongue, if they do it until around the age 7.

It's a wrap up of the book, but it also makes some statements about parenting that I love and fully agree with. I think if you have kids this is a must read.

It was fascinating to read that when babies initially begin to babble, they are able to differentiate all spoken sounds. Then the culture they are living in exerts its influence.""Once babies reach the babbling milestone, the universal phase of language production ends. Babies from different cultures, learning different languages, start to make the distinctive noises of their own community sometime between a year and a year and a half. The Chinese baby starts to babble in a way that sounds Chinese. She uses very rapid pitch changes just like adult Chinese speakers. Swedish babies babble in a way that sounds distinctly Swedish, using the rising intonation patterns typical of adult speakers of Swedish.""The research described in this book gave good reasons why I am constantly amazed every time I spend time with my grandsons."
45,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1776460-michael,2,"This book is by three developmental psychologists who study how babies and toddlers learn. At its best, the book shows how experiments and observations have overturned long held preconceptions on just what babies know at different stages of their development. Bottom line: a heck of a lot more than what we used to think.However, this truly interesting material could be boiled down to about 40-50 pages of this 200 page book. The rest of the book is plagued by overly long set ups to points, strained (and, in one case, involving how eye sight works, just plain wrong) examples and analogies, and somewhere near the halfway point, the authors ran out of experiments and facts to convey and they rehash the same material in different contexts while coming to basically the same conclusions. This book truly lacked competent editorial guidance, as it reads more like a first draft -- the first of many -- rather than an acceptable final product. Stay away."

It doesn't give any parenting advice, but it does give great information about developmental stages, language acquisition, and studies on babies and very young children. It also gave a brief history on how child development has become a respected, even exciting scientific arena. I recommend browsing the chapters and reading through anything that grabs your attention;reading the book straight through you'll notice a lot of repetition of themes. In essence, I'm glad I borrowed it from the library, I'm glad I read it, and I'm glad I didn't buy it because I won't likely read it again.

However, I did learn a lot about the brain that I didn't know (both mine and my baby's). Also I appreciate the chance to learn something about babies with out getting an earful of unwanted advice! If you live with a baby or if you just want to learn about how your own brain works and get a few laughs in the mean time, I recommend this book."

It's like it doesn't believe what it has to say is interesting, so it keeps trying to tie it into stuff that I don't give a crap about. It's like watching a documentary about insects and having Oprah's voice-over speculatively anthropomorphizing the whole time. For example, it says giving birth is ""like a cross between running a marathon and having the most enormous, shattering, irresistible orgasm of your life."" Why are there so many adjectives before ""orgasm""? Then it goes further to say ""The romance doesn't come, sadly, with every birth, just as the parallel romance of true love doesn't come with every sexual encounter."" Am I weird for thinking that the authors are forcing an unnecessary correlation? Anyway. We'll see if I can get control of my gag reflex enough to read beyond the 35 pages it took this book to annoy me."

The writing is not as spell-binding (a little more clinical sometimes) than Norman Doidge.Still, the information it contains is fascinating and really made me think about what my kids have done, experienced and seen in their short lives and how it's affected them.

Unlike most 'baby books,' this one is not a 'how to' book nor a week by week description of what to expect of a new born. The three authors instead explain what is now known (as of 2000) about how babies see the world and learn about people, language, and themselves. For any one new to parenthood or being in the presence of babies, I highly recommend 'Scientist in the Crib'. It will give you a new way of seeing and understanding that little tyke you're watching."
51,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624786-lisa,3,"This is for sure an interesting book. As the authors point out- different than other parenting books because it is NOT a ""how to"" manual. However, I was surprised to find there was little in it I didn't already know- a feeling reinforced by the redundancy in some sections. I guess it's fairly dated, and all those baby studies find their way into the public media one way or the other. No doubt the studies covered were really ground-breaking at the time but now it's current paradigm kind of stuff. I did like the perspective on the cognitive development associated with the ""terrible twos"". I think it will help us relax about any defiance. "

The book starts out strong, combining fundamentals of develomental psychology and cognitive science with fascinating research and experiments. The authors initially keep the discussion grounded in concrete, observable infanct behavior, but eventually the discussion gives way to an overly technical and dry description of brain function with nary a baby in sight. I'd recommend the first few chapters, but skip the last few. I wasn't expecting a parenting book, but I found myself more interested in the research narratives than the science behind it. "

After first going over some history of how we adults have viewed babies' minds historically, the book then dives into three big questions: How do babies figure out that other people have minds? How do babies make sense of the world around them from the chaotic information their senses provide? and How do babies learn language? The book then goes on to try and integrate some of the information from the various questions and gives some information about what science has learned (as of 1999) about children's brains."

I don't mean it gives you tips on how to raise them, no, it tells you how their brains actually develop and how they learn about the world. Based on tons of research but written in a way that you don't need a degree to understand (though if you have a degree you appreciate that every idea is backed up with experimental data.)If you ever wondered why your kids make goo goo sounds or why they call every four legged animal ""doggie"" this book is for you."

It turns out that the greatest of us found in the earliest of us. Not adulthood.That doesn’t mean that we should cringe and wishy-washy wanting to go back being babies. Though in some sense it is true: by being childlike is to truly live.This isn’t something new. Ancient religions and philosophers has discovered this as well. Jesus well noted saying that in order to go to Heaven, one must be like a child. Jiddu Khrisnamukti taught about seeing without concepts. Alan Watts, many more.It turns out that everything that is great has summarily pointed to the same direction.Learn about children, you learned about live."

Those parts are well written and presented interestingly - at least the first few chapters on things and people. The last chapters are a bit of a repeat and philosophical in a way that was less interesting, but it ends with some agreeable passages of the perils of being a parent"
100,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/276789-seebany,5,"This book was fascinating for its premise that babies are 1) born with preconceived ideas, 2) test them out and are able to adapt their understanding of reality rapidly (unlike most adults), and 3) have powerful tools for learning, i.e., the caregivers around them. They use a lot of analogies, i.e., that they are scientists or that they are like computers unlike any we've ever built.It's broken into three main sections on what babies know and learn about a) other people, b) things in the world, and c) language. For the first parts of the book I sort of felt like the authors' premise was more about ""The Philosopher in the Crib"" because cognitive science, the way they laid it out, is very much about philosophical questions. But it was all very interesting. And the experiments that they talk about* showing what we know about the way babies think are amazing. For example, at four months an American baby can distinguish all the phonemes of English. But they can also also separate out all the sounds of Swahili, too. By one year, though, they've lost this ability, or rather, traded it for added fluency in their home language.Given my enjoyment of Sacks's ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,"" perhaps I just like a certain type of book: popular science nonfiction about the mind. In another life, maybe I would've been a cognitive scientist.FYI, I understand Alison Gopnik is the sister of Adam Gopnik, the New Yorker writer. That's why the name looks familiar.* all the references to the experiments are in the Appendix, so you can track down the actual articles."
101,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,4,"A fascinating book about babies' intelligence and plasticity. The authors argue that babies are neither blank slates-- born stupid until adults pour information into them--nor physically predetermined to develop at certain intervals, without much influence from adults. Rather, babies are born with a surprising amount of knowledge and ability, and then they take on huge volumes of information from the world and other people by actively seeking out evidence and experimenting with it.The early chapters describing how babies learn about people, objects, and language are riveting. Later chapters on the structure of baby minds and brains are less interesting, as they repeat quite a lot of what's already been said. I appreciated the final chapter's caution against quack baby learning experts and its call for more parent-friendly policies in the US.I enjoyed the authors' style. They elucidate scientific evidence clearly for laypeople, with plenty of humour and fellow-parent-feeling. One real drawback to this book is the ableist language. Conditions like autism and dyslexia are described as ""tragic"" exceptions to the rule that babies are intelligent. I hope the authors revisit their choice of words in any future edition."
102,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632236-ann,4,"This book, written for the layperson, is a well-written, comprehensive look at the minds and brains of very young children, a theory concerning what children know from birth and an explanation of how they learn in the first few years of their lives. The analogies help the non-scientific among us to understand, to some degree, how the brain works. The descriptions of the experiments that back-up the theories are fun to read and make me almost want to be one of those researchers who get to play with children for a living. The occasional one-liners and parenthetical asides add a witty lightness to the text. The theories presented make sense to me as a layperson though there are other scientists who may not agree with them. The only fault I find comes at the end of the book where for a chapter or two the authors seem to be summing up their positions over and over again. That said, however, Chapter 6, “What Scientists Have Learned about Children’s Brains” was fascinating and well worth the time.On the whole, it was a very interesting and fun book to read."

Then the culture they are living in exerts its influence.""Once babies reach the babbling milestone, the universal phase of language production ends. Babies from different cultures, learning different languages, start to make the distinctive noises of their own community sometime between a year and a year and a half. The Chinese baby starts to babble in a way that sounds Chinese. She uses very rapid pitch changes just like adult Chinese speakers. Swedish babies babble in a way that sounds distinctly Swedish, using the rising intonation patterns typical of adult speakers of Swedish.""The research described in this book gave good reasons why I am constantly amazed every time I spend time with my grandsons."
135,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1776460-michael,2,"This book is by three developmental psychologists who study how babies and toddlers learn. At its best, the book shows how experiments and observations have overturned long held preconceptions on just what babies know at different stages of their development. Bottom line: a heck of a lot more than what we used to think.However, this truly interesting material could be boiled down to about 40-50 pages of this 200 page book. The rest of the book is plagued by overly long set ups to points, strained (and, in one case, involving how eye sight works, just plain wrong) examples and analogies, and somewhere near the halfway point, the authors ran out of experiments and facts to convey and they rehash the same material in different contexts while coming to basically the same conclusions. This book truly lacked competent editorial guidance, as it reads more like a first draft -- the first of many -- rather than an acceptable final product. Stay away."

It doesn't give any parenting advice, but it does give great information about developmental stages, language acquisition, and studies on babies and very young children. It also gave a brief history on how child development has become a respected, even exciting scientific arena. I recommend browsing the chapters and reading through anything that grabs your attention;reading the book straight through you'll notice a lot of repetition of themes. In essence, I'm glad I borrowed it from the library, I'm glad I read it, and I'm glad I didn't buy it because I won't likely read it again.

It kind of reminds me of the public radio show Radio Lab if that means anything to you.I know I am going to be annoying people in the near future spouting out all my new found knowledge - the way we learn language is particularly interesting!The first half is more interesting than the second, which is a little slow at times and repetitive. However, I did learn a lot about the brain that I didn't know (both mine and my baby's). Also I appreciate the chance to learn something about babies with out getting an earful of unwanted advice! If you live with a baby or if you just want to learn about how your own brain works and get a few laughs in the mean time, I recommend this book."
138,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/131520-christa,2,"So far, I am extremely irritated at the tone of this book. It's like it doesn't believe what it has to say is interesting, so it keeps trying to tie it into stuff that I don't give a crap about. It's like watching a documentary about insects and having Oprah's voice-over speculatively anthropomorphizing the whole time. For example, it says giving birth is ""like a cross between running a marathon and having the most enormous, shattering, irresistible orgasm of your life."" Why are there so many adjectives before ""orgasm""? Then it goes further to say ""The romance doesn't come, sadly, with every birth, just as the parallel romance of true love doesn't come with every sexual encounter."" Am I weird for thinking that the authors are forcing an unnecessary correlation? Anyway. We'll see if I can get control of my gag reflex enough to read beyond the 35 pages it took this book to annoy me."
139,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1349824-carol,4,"This is a fascinating read and a great companion to The Brain That Changes Itself. It's all about what scientists have learned about babies, infants and toddlers and how they learn. I would have given it five stars, but frankly, I did get a little bored about halfway through and my reading of it stalled. The writing is not as spell-binding (a little more clinical sometimes) than Norman Doidge.Still, the information it contains is fascinating and really made me think about what my kids have done, experienced and seen in their short lives and how it's affected them. I would hope that just about any parent would find its information interesting and thought-provoking."

Unlike most 'baby books,' this one is not a 'how to' book nor a week by week description of what to expect of a new born. The three authors instead explain what is now known (as of 2000) about how babies see the world and learn about people, language, and themselves. For any one new to parenthood or being in the presence of babies, I highly recommend 'Scientist in the Crib'. It will give you a new way of seeing and understanding that little tyke you're watching."
141,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624786-lisa,3,"This is for sure an interesting book. As the authors point out- different than other parenting books because it is NOT a ""how to"" manual. However, I was surprised to find there was little in it I didn't already know- a feeling reinforced by the redundancy in some sections. I guess it's fairly dated, and all those baby studies find their way into the public media one way or the other. No doubt the studies covered were really ground-breaking at the time but now it's current paradigm kind of stuff. I did like the perspective on the cognitive development associated with the ""terrible twos"". I think it will help us relax about any defiance. "
142,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140288-elizabeth,2,"I guess I shouldn't complain that a book with the word ""scientist"" in the title was too science-y, but it was. The book starts out strong, combining fundamentals of develomental psychology and cognitive science with fascinating research and experiments. The authors initially keep the discussion grounded in concrete, observable infanct behavior, but eventually the discussion gives way to an overly technical and dry description of brain function with nary a baby in sight. I'd recommend the first few chapters, but skip the last few. I wasn't expecting a parenting book, but I found myself more interested in the research narratives than the science behind it. "

After first going over some history of how we adults have viewed babies' minds historically, the book then dives into three big questions: How do babies figure out that other people have minds? How do babies make sense of the world around them from the chaotic information their senses provide? and How do babies learn language? The book then goes on to try and integrate some of the information from the various questions and gives some information about what science has learned (as of 1999) about children's brains."

It was as informative as I remember. This is truly the instruction manual for babies. I don't mean it gives you tips on how to raise them, no, it tells you how their brains actually develop and how they learn about the world. Based on tons of research but written in a way that you don't need a degree to understand (though if you have a degree you appreciate that every idea is backed up with experimental data.)If you ever wondered why your kids make goo goo sounds or why they call every four legged animal ""doggie"" this book is for you."

The science behind how babies minds work is fascinating and this book does a good job at describing it for a lay-person. However, I felt like sometimes they simplified things and repeated themselves far too much. More than once I found myself thinking, ""You told me this already!"" and getting rather frustrated. I'd like to read more on this subject, but from a less patronizing source."

An enjoyable, quick read though. Incidentally, I first saw Dr. Gopnik lecturing on ted.com, where she covered some of the material that was in this book. She's an interesting speaker and her humor comes out in her writing. All in all I would recommend this as a primer if you're interested in developmental psychology. "

It turns out that the greatest of us found in the earliest of us. Not adulthood.That doesn’t mean that we should cringe and wishy-washy wanting to go back being babies. Though in some sense it is true: by being childlike is to truly live.This isn’t something new. Ancient religions and philosophers has discovered this as well. Jesus well noted saying that in order to go to Heaven, one must be like a child. Jiddu Khrisnamukti taught about seeing without concepts. Alan Watts, many more.It turns out that everything that is great has summarily pointed to the same direction.Learn about children, you learned about live."

And they are diving into seemingly simple matters that turn out quite complex when one needs to understand where babies are starting from. Those parts are well written and presented interestingly - at least the first few chapters on things and people. The last chapters are a bit of a repeat and philosophical in a way that was less interesting, but it ends with some agreeable passages of the perils of being a parent"
190,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/276789-seebany,5,"This book was fascinating for its premise that babies are 1) born with preconceived ideas, 2) test them out and are able to adapt their understanding of reality rapidly (unlike most adults), and 3) have powerful tools for learning, i.e., the caregivers around them. They use a lot of analogies, i.e., that they are scientists or that they are like computers unlike any we've ever built.It's broken into three main sections on what babies know and learn about a) other people, b) things in the world, and c) language. For the first parts of the book I sort of felt like the authors' premise was more about ""The Philosopher in the Crib"" because cognitive science, the way they laid it out, is very much about philosophical questions. But it was all very interesting. And the experiments that they talk about* showing what we know about the way babies think are amazing. For example, at four months an American baby can distinguish all the phonemes of English. But they can also also separate out all the sounds of Swahili, too. By one year, though, they've lost this ability, or rather, traded it for added fluency in their home language.Given my enjoyment of Sacks's ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,"" perhaps I just like a certain type of book: popular science nonfiction about the mind. In another life, maybe I would've been a cognitive scientist.FYI, I understand Alison Gopnik is the sister of Adam Gopnik, the New Yorker writer. That's why the name looks familiar.* all the references to the experiments are in the Appendix, so you can track down the actual articles."
191,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,4,"A fascinating book about babies' intelligence and plasticity. The authors argue that babies are neither blank slates-- born stupid until adults pour information into them--nor physically predetermined to develop at certain intervals, without much influence from adults. Rather, babies are born with a surprising amount of knowledge and ability, and then they take on huge volumes of information from the world and other people by actively seeking out evidence and experimenting with it.The early chapters describing how babies learn about people, objects, and language are riveting. Later chapters on the structure of baby minds and brains are less interesting, as they repeat quite a lot of what's already been said. I appreciated the final chapter's caution against quack baby learning experts and its call for more parent-friendly policies in the US.I enjoyed the authors' style. They elucidate scientific evidence clearly for laypeople, with plenty of humour and fellow-parent-feeling. One real drawback to this book is the ableist language. Conditions like autism and dyslexia are described as ""tragic"" exceptions to the rule that babies are intelligent. I hope the authors revisit their choice of words in any future edition."
192,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632236-ann,4,"This book, written for the layperson, is a well-written, comprehensive look at the minds and brains of very young children, a theory concerning what children know from birth and an explanation of how they learn in the first few years of their lives. The analogies help the non-scientific among us to understand, to some degree, how the brain works. The descriptions of the experiments that back-up the theories are fun to read and make me almost want to be one of those researchers who get to play with children for a living. The occasional one-liners and parenthetical asides add a witty lightness to the text. The theories presented make sense to me as a layperson though there are other scientists who may not agree with them. The only fault I find comes at the end of the book where for a chapter or two the authors seem to be summing up their positions over and over again. That said, however, Chapter 6, “What Scientists Have Learned about Children’s Brains” was fascinating and well worth the time.On the whole, it was a very interesting and fun book to read."

Not that I didn't think she was always learning as I already knew that...but the level of things babies know is crazy. They are very smart even at such young ages. Chapter 4 was a little slow, but not slow enough to take a star away. The last chapter was just wonderful. It's a wrap up of the book, but it also makes some statements about parenting that I love and fully agree with. I think if you have kids this is a must read.

225,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1776460-michael,2,"This book is by three developmental psychologists who study how babies and toddlers learn. At its best, the book shows how experiments and observations have overturned long held preconceptions on just what babies know at different stages of their development. Bottom line: a heck of a lot more than what we used to think.However, this truly interesting material could be boiled down to about 40-50 pages of this 200 page book. The rest of the book is plagued by overly long set ups to points, strained (and, in one case, involving how eye sight works, just plain wrong) examples and analogies, and somewhere near the halfway point, the authors ran out of experiments and facts to convey and they rehash the same material in different contexts while coming to basically the same conclusions. This book truly lacked competent editorial guidance, as it reads more like a first draft -- the first of many -- rather than an acceptable final product. Stay away."

It doesn't give any parenting advice, but it does give great information about developmental stages, language acquisition, and studies on babies and very young children. It also gave a brief history on how child development has become a respected, even exciting scientific arena. I recommend browsing the chapters and reading through anything that grabs your attention;reading the book straight through you'll notice a lot of repetition of themes. In essence, I'm glad I borrowed it from the library, I'm glad I read it, and I'm glad I didn't buy it because I won't likely read it again.

It kind of reminds me of the public radio show Radio Lab if that means anything to you.I know I am going to be annoying people in the near future spouting out all my new found knowledge - the way we learn language is particularly interesting!The first half is more interesting than the second, which is a little slow at times and repetitive. However, I did learn a lot about the brain that I didn't know (both mine and my baby's). Also I appreciate the chance to learn something about babies with out getting an earful of unwanted advice! If you live with a baby or if you just want to learn about how your own brain works and get a few laughs in the mean time, I recommend this book."

It's like it doesn't believe what it has to say is interesting, so it keeps trying to tie it into stuff that I don't give a crap about. It's like watching a documentary about insects and having Oprah's voice-over speculatively anthropomorphizing the whole time. For example, it says giving birth is ""like a cross between running a marathon and having the most enormous, shattering, irresistible orgasm of your life."" Why are there so many adjectives before ""orgasm""? Then it goes further to say ""The romance doesn't come, sadly, with every birth, just as the parallel romance of true love doesn't come with every sexual encounter."" Am I weird for thinking that the authors are forcing an unnecessary correlation? Anyway. We'll see if I can get control of my gag reflex enough to read beyond the 35 pages it took this book to annoy me."

It's all about what scientists have learned about babies, infants and toddlers and how they learn. I would have given it five stars, but frankly, I did get a little bored about halfway through and my reading of it stalled. The writing is not as spell-binding (a little more clinical sometimes) than Norman Doidge.Still, the information it contains is fascinating and really made me think about what my kids have done, experienced and seen in their short lives and how it's affected them. I would hope that just about any parent would find its information interesting and thought-provoking."

Unlike most 'baby books,' this one is not a 'how to' book nor a week by week description of what to expect of a new born. The three authors instead explain what is now known (as of 2000) about how babies see the world and learn about people, language, and themselves. For any one new to parenthood or being in the presence of babies, I highly recommend 'Scientist in the Crib'. It will give you a new way of seeing and understanding that little tyke you're watching."
231,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624786-lisa,3,"This is for sure an interesting book. As the authors point out- different than other parenting books because it is NOT a ""how to"" manual. However, I was surprised to find there was little in it I didn't already know- a feeling reinforced by the redundancy in some sections. I guess it's fairly dated, and all those baby studies find their way into the public media one way or the other. No doubt the studies covered were really ground-breaking at the time but now it's current paradigm kind of stuff. I did like the perspective on the cognitive development associated with the ""terrible twos"". I think it will help us relax about any defiance. "

The book starts out strong, combining fundamentals of develomental psychology and cognitive science with fascinating research and experiments. The authors initially keep the discussion grounded in concrete, observable infanct behavior, but eventually the discussion gives way to an overly technical and dry description of brain function with nary a baby in sight. I'd recommend the first few chapters, but skip the last few. I wasn't expecting a parenting book, but I found myself more interested in the research narratives than the science behind it. "

After first going over some history of how we adults have viewed babies' minds historically, the book then dives into three big questions: How do babies figure out that other people have minds? How do babies make sense of the world around them from the chaotic information their senses provide? and How do babies learn language? The book then goes on to try and integrate some of the information from the various questions and gives some information about what science has learned (as of 1999) about children's brains."

It was as informative as I remember. This is truly the instruction manual for babies. I don't mean it gives you tips on how to raise them, no, it tells you how their brains actually develop and how they learn about the world. Based on tons of research but written in a way that you don't need a degree to understand (though if you have a degree you appreciate that every idea is backed up with experimental data.)If you ever wondered why your kids make goo goo sounds or why they call every four legged animal ""doggie"" this book is for you."

The science behind how babies minds work is fascinating and this book does a good job at describing it for a lay-person. However, I felt like sometimes they simplified things and repeated themselves far too much. More than once I found myself thinking, ""You told me this already!"" and getting rather frustrated.

An enjoyable, quick read though. Incidentally, I first saw Dr. Gopnik lecturing on ted.com, where she covered some of the material that was in this book.

It turns out that the greatest of us found in the earliest of us. Not adulthood.That doesn’t mean that we should cringe and wishy-washy wanting to go back being babies. Though in some sense it is true: by being childlike is to truly live.This isn’t something new. Ancient religions and philosophers has discovered this as well. Jesus well noted saying that in order to go to Heaven, one must be like a child. Jiddu Khrisnamukti taught about seeing without concepts. Alan Watts, many more.It turns out that everything that is great has summarily pointed to the same direction.Learn about children, you learned about live."

And they are diving into seemingly simple matters that turn out quite complex when one needs to understand where babies are starting from. Those parts are well written and presented interestingly - at least the first few chapters on things and people. The last chapters are a bit of a repeat and philosophical in a way that was less interesting, but it ends with some agreeable passages of the perils of being a parent"
280,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/276789-seebany,5,"This book was fascinating for its premise that babies are 1) born with preconceived ideas, 2) test them out and are able to adapt their understanding of reality rapidly (unlike most adults), and 3) have powerful tools for learning, i.e., the caregivers around them. They use a lot of analogies, i.e., that they are scientists or that they are like computers unlike any we've ever built.It's broken into three main sections on what babies know and learn about a) other people, b) things in the world, and c) language. For the first parts of the book I sort of felt like the authors' premise was more about ""The Philosopher in the Crib"" because cognitive science, the way they laid it out, is very much about philosophical questions. But it was all very interesting. And the experiments that they talk about* showing what we know about the way babies think are amazing. For example, at four months an American baby can distinguish all the phonemes of English. But they can also also separate out all the sounds of Swahili, too. By one year, though, they've lost this ability, or rather, traded it for added fluency in their home language.Given my enjoyment of Sacks's ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,"" perhaps I just like a certain type of book: popular science nonfiction about the mind. In another life, maybe I would've been a cognitive scientist.FYI, I understand Alison Gopnik is the sister of Adam Gopnik, the New Yorker writer. That's why the name looks familiar.* all the references to the experiments are in the Appendix, so you can track down the actual articles."
281,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,4,"A fascinating book about babies' intelligence and plasticity. The authors argue that babies are neither blank slates-- born stupid until adults pour information into them--nor physically predetermined to develop at certain intervals, without much influence from adults. Rather, babies are born with a surprising amount of knowledge and ability, and then they take on huge volumes of information from the world and other people by actively seeking out evidence and experimenting with it.The early chapters describing how babies learn about people, objects, and language are riveting. Later chapters on the structure of baby minds and brains are less interesting, as they repeat quite a lot of what's already been said. I appreciated the final chapter's caution against quack baby learning experts and its call for more parent-friendly policies in the US.I enjoyed the authors' style. They elucidate scientific evidence clearly for laypeople, with plenty of humour and fellow-parent-feeling. One real drawback to this book is the ableist language. Conditions like autism and dyslexia are described as ""tragic"" exceptions to the rule that babies are intelligent. I hope the authors revisit their choice of words in any future edition."
282,0688177883,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632236-ann,4,"This book, written for the layperson, is a well-written, comprehensive look at the minds and brains of very young children, a theory concerning what children know from birth and an explanation of how they learn in the first few years of their lives. The analogies help the non-scientific among us to understand, to some degree, how the brain works. The descriptions of the experiments that back-up the theories are fun to read and make me almost want to be one of those researchers who get to play with children for a living. The occasional one-liners and parenthetical asides add a witty lightness to the text. The theories presented make sense to me as a layperson though there are other scientists who may not agree with them. The only fault I find comes at the end of the book where for a chapter or two the authors seem to be summing up their positions over and over again. That said, however, Chapter 6, “What Scientists Have Learned about Children’s Brains” was fascinating and well worth the time.On the whole, it was a very interesting and fun book to read."

Not that I didn't think she was always learning as I already knew that...but the level of things babies know is crazy. They are very smart even at such young ages. Chapter 4 was a little slow, but not slow enough to take a star away. The last chapter was just wonderful. It's a wrap up of the book, but it also makes some statements about parenting that I love and fully agree with. I think if you have kids this is a must read.

It does have a useful bibliography, but the book was published over 10 years ago, so newer studies are not included. I use it to guide my teaching for students of all ages."

I didn't care for how the authors waxed poetic about their analogy of babies to scientists, because though it's an interesting point, it's done in two pages. Not two chapters! This is my main complaint about many non-fiction books though, they seem too packed with filler...and perhaps to other readers that doesn't come across as filler but useful content. Dunno."
