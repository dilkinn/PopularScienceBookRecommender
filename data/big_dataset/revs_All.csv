1,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4659464-jessaka,5,"Will Hunt spent time in the N.Y. underground, the subway tunnels. Revs did as well. Revs was a graffiti artist who spent many years using N.Y. City as a canvas. He became famous, but not in a way that made him money. Then Revs took a ladder, paints, and other tools of his trade into the subway tunnels at night when no one was watching. He picked out the most obscure sections, tose filled with darkness, to begin writing his book. With a paint roller and yellow or white paint, he made large book pages; his ladder came in handy. Then he took a spray can of black paint and began writing his life down. Will Hunt copied down his writings, but hed found it dangerous to dodge the trains. He met Revs once, and he tried to ask him questions about his art in those tunnels, but Revs wasn’t interested in talking. You can find some of those pages online by typing Revs, N.Y. City, Subway, and Diary.Will Hunt had spent years checking out underground cities and caves. It was quite a journey. In Paris he found the underground city and ventured below. It was what people called the catacombs, only it really wasn’t a burial place, not the kind we think of. He walked for miles and miles, and found rooms upon rooms. He learned that some of the people of Paris go into these catacombs to have parties, to even watch movies. Then there was a room where he found human remains, bones. Long ago there had been a plague. There were so many deaths that they could not bury all the bodies, so they threw the bodies down a hole above ground that landed the bodies in a room below, down in the catacombs. Life had lost its sacredness. Then Will went to Australia to see a cave there, one that the Aboriginal people were still able to protect. It was an ochre mine. The Aboriginals believe that they came up from these caves in the beginning of time. Even some of the Native Americans have this belief. There are actually creatures living in that darkness, creatures with no eyes. I ask, “How can a human, who had evolved in the caves, more than likely with no eyes, come out into the light and survive?” I have this vision of their sitting at the mouth of the cave in the sunlight feeling its warmth and the fresh air, fearing to venture no further, but after thousands upon thousands of years, developing eye sight. I especially like their belief that they went upon the earth along songlines (paths) singing songs, bringing the nature into existence. I think of the Creator as singing songs that brought the universe into existence. My favorite chapters were those on the caves, a topic that did not draw me to this book; it was the underground cities that had caught my interest. When Will writes, you see it all, you feel it all. First there were the cave paintings, which I had always found to be beautiful when seeing them in books or on the walls of a class room at college. Then there were the two bison sculptures made of clay from the cave. Whenever people came into the cave, Tuc d'Audoubert, they felt a sense of worship. A sacredness. It was in these caves that the cave dwellers had their religious ceremonies. They danced themselves into trances, seen by the footprints that had remained in the cave all these years. But what is more, being in a dark cave, in total darkness can cause the mind to expand. You get visions. And so I end this review with a couple of my own stories:When I was growing up in Paso Robles, CA there was the Cumming’s Mansion. Kids had stories about it. It was now abandoned, the man had, and his wife was in a rest home. Teenagers used to break into the house, so Mary and I thought, “Let’s try it.” We went to the back of the house during the day and began tearing boards off one of its windows. We climbed in and looked around. People had thrown things around. It was a mess. We went into the kitchen, and I saw a door, opened it, and found it led down to the cellar. I could see wine kegs, but that was all. We had not brought a flashlight, so we didn’t venture down the dark stairs. If we had, perhaps we would have found the tunnel, but we had not heard of it or perhaps we would have both brought flashlights.Years later my mom sent me a newspaper article on the Cumming’s Mansion because she had known of my interest in it. I wish that I still had that article. It said that Mr. Cummings had dug a tunnel from the basement to the lot across the street as an escape route. Who knows what he feared? Anyway, some high school kids had been in the tunnel and had started a fire by accident, so they closed up the opening to the tunnel. The house is no longer there, and it certainly would have made a wonderful museum.Then my husband told me a story of going to Chinatown in S.F. right after he first t of Nam. He was with his high school friend Jesse. Jesse’s older brother, Raymond, had asked them to come with him for protection. They packed guns. To Raymond led them into a Chinese restaurant, through the back room and then down stairs leading to an underground city. There was a very long hallway that had rooms on each side, and he could smell opium coming from the rooms. Raymond then went into a room by himself while they stayed out in the hall. Raymond later told him that there were prostitutes and opium dens down there and you could walk for a long time and come up in various parts of Chinatown. But it was a dangerous place, because you had to be either with a Chinese man or have some other business there. My husband felt it unwise to return. So I had hoped that Will Hunt had also heard of the underground city in Chinatown and had ventured there, but he hadn’t. What other cities do we have in America or around the world that people don’t know about?  I have heard of underground cities in the past, so my interest in this book. What I didn’t expect was that this book was also about caves that the author had visited, and this section of the book turned out to be much more fascinating than the underground cities, because early man not only painted the cave walls, he also made animal sculptures from its clay, and then held religious rituals in them. What is more interesting is that the author stated that when you are in total darkness your mind can expand and cause you to have visions. Listening to his and other people’s experiences while visiting these caves, made them seen very sacred. I also found it interesting that the Aborigines in Australia and some American Indianals believe that they originally came from the caves. I doubt this because if you have evolved in darkness, like the animals in the caves, you wouldn’t develop eye sight, which I feel is needed in order to survive above ground, but then again, there could be an explanation that would prove me wrong. The author first went to Paris’ underground city, which I believe he said was 200 miles long. He first had to find a guide to help him find a way to get in, and when he did he walked much it. There were rooms and more rooms. One room was full of human remains, bones. There had been a plague centuries ago, so they dropped the bodies down a hole into this room and then covered it up. Mext, he mentioned how people sneak down to these catacombs and have parties in some of the rooms, even showing movies. I was fascinated by the subway system in N.Y. City, and how a man named Revs went into the underground where the subway trains run and there he painted pages of a book on the walls, and wrote his autobiography on them. I would love if the author of this book would publish them. He could call it Revs’ Life and other Graffiti. What Rev had done was paint the pages using white or yellow paint, and then with black spray paint he wrote about his life. (After I wrote this, I went online and found that someone had actually put his online. You can read it here: https://publicdelivery.org/revs-autob... )Graffiti can be interesting. I had a boyfriend in Berkeley in the 70s who wrote for the Berkeley Barb, an underground newspaper. He asked me if I would go into the women’s restrooms in town for him and write down the graffiti that I found interesting. He wanted to write an article on graffiti for the Barb. I remember one piece of graffiti in the Sproul Hall women’s restroom on campus. It was something about Nixon, saying that he had a crooked dick. And then I recall one in the Renaissance Cafe where one woman had written, “My mother made me a lesbian,” and another woman wrote under that, “If I give her a needle and thread will she make me one too?” Pricelessw. Revs’ graffiti was also priceless.And then there were what they called “The Mole People,” people who can’t stop digging. One man dug under his house for 40 years, just making tunnels. His back yard was piled high in soil from his diggings. His neighbors must have loved him. I have my own stories: There was the Cumming’s Mansion in my home town of Paso Robles, CA. When I was a teenager, I had heard that it was empty and boarded up, so my friend Mary and I broke into the house by tearing boards off one of it’s windows. We had not heard about the underground tunnel, and since we had no flashlights, we were afraid to go down into the basement, but if we had, maybe we would have found it. Years later my mom sent me a newspaper article on the Cumming’s Mansion because she had known of my interest in it. I wish that I still had that article.

He learned from Raymond that there were prostitution and opium dens there, and that you could walk for a long time and come up in various parts of Chinatown. My husband only went twice with them, and then he got married and went to college. He has no idea what had happened to Jesse after that as they lost contact with each other, which was really for the best. S n in France they fell in awe.

2,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5427149-nick-borrelli,5,"Very cool book about the unique world of our subterranean landscape. Whether it be subway systems, mines, catacombs, underground tunnels, etc.... This is a fascinating world tour penned by an urban explorer who documents the amazing underground world that exists and that we rarely even notice or think about. A quick read but a very fun one that I found entertaining and enlightening. Definitely pick this one up when it comes out in January of 2019."
3,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7182738-mel,5,"Imagine yourself on an afternoon hike, stooping to push aside branches blocking a walk that meandered off the beaten path, and upon removing the pile of debris feeling the breath of a world beneath you coming from a small obscure opening in the ground. It takes a certain type of person to venture into this opening.Interesting and well-researched; more philosophical than I expected. Author Will Hunt, I discovered, is equal parts thrill-seeker, philosopher, and academic. The mythology and other pieces of history the author connects to the world-wide sites he visits are worth thinking about. The author goes deep, both literally and figuratively and does a good job of accomplishing a well thought out and structured book about the subject of *worlds* (civilizations, creations, megacosms).  
 REVS’ autobiography, in the farthest folds of NY's subway

Descending into underground of Paris
Where I expected more of a look into unknown subterranean discoveries through the eyes of a thrill-seeking explorer, I was educated rather than merely thrilled. True, it is thrilling to think of new discoveries beneath the feet we think are standing on terra firma. I was impressed by the information Hunt covers and the many diverse locations he shares. More importantly, I was humbled by the reminder of the stewardship we have over our earth, and that we seem to be drifting away from the sense of respect and appreciation for our planet that generations before us have had, especially indigenous peoples. 
The Panel of the Great Black Cow, in the Cave at Lascaux




Unicorn, in the Hall of the Bulls

As we move more towards what we term scientific, we forget other possibilities. ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."" 
Aboriginal Rock Art
 Citing some mind-bending theories, Hunt discusses scientists that have supported the possibility of life beginning actually beneath the surface of what was a violently evolving planet. The primordial incubation of life in the womb of Mother Earth aligns with the comparative mythology of several indigenous peoples. Whether you are Team Core Accretion or Team Disk Instability, the fact that these two theories of how our Earth formed are still ""duking it out"" adds to an interesting examination of how close what we think we know matches to how much we actually know, and how close mythology walks in the shadow of science."
4,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26041131-julie,5,"This was a deeply profound book. It was also a love letter from the author to tunnels and caves and all else that lurks under our feet. The author is obsessed to put it mildly, but thank goodness because it’s only through obsessed people that we learn things. The author descends where few have or ever will to report back on what is down there. What he finds is strange and beautiful and mysterious. What he finds is our history and our religion. What he finds is each of us, whether we know it or not. For this reason, this book will resonate with everyone that reads it. This book was structured wonderfully. It was a magical cocktail of adventure, history, mythology, art, anthropology, biology, and neuroscience. The author tells us of his first descent into the underworld when a kid in Rhode Island. It was a moment akin to when eighth grade Bill Gates walked into his classroom to find a computer. Both the author and Gates were hooked by “it.”What is going on down there has fascinated me ever since I read of Alice jumping down that rabbit hole. Her adventures still resonate with us in part because of the story and the language, but also because deep down inside, we are all fascinated with the world beneath our feet. And the more I read this book, the more I was hooked. Though most of us feel like aliens when going underground, there is for some a feeling of coming home again. Even when that home is like a haunted house with spiders the size of chihuahuas. After the author shares his first adventure under his childhood home in Rhode Island he moves on to underground adventures around the world.His journey underground Paris was fascinating. Above ground are all these historic landmarks and below, just as fascinating, are elegant archways and ornate spiral staircases. Rooms underground have things like a sculpture akin to Michelangelo’s David, gargoyles, disco balls. In 2004, a movie theater was found adjacent to a bar, lounge, workshop and a small dining room. When the author wrote of camping underground, it was hard to imagine how one could sleep under such conditions. The author described it like camping on the moon with no sounds, just miles of darkness where it’s always never o’clock. When the author wrote of a man from 1818 named John Cleves Symmes who declared his intent to lead a voyage to the interior of the earth to prove that it was hollow and habitable, I couldn’t help but think of Alice in Wonderland. While in the end, Symmes was considered a loon who wasted his life chasing fairy tales of underground lands, before that he sparked the imagination of many. It seems likely it sparked the imagination of the man that sparked the world’s imagination, the author of Alice in Wonderland. There is little doubt that tales from the likes of Jules Verne, HG Welles, and Frank Baum were sparked from Symmes too. When the author ventures into the mines of Australia, things got really weird with miners appeasing the lord of the underworld by gifts and sacrifices and making figures to symbolize him. It was strange. Yet it is also beautiful how the aboriginal people see their ancestors as very much part of their world. They honor them in a way that our culture rarely does. There were a lot of cool photographs in this book, one in particular struck me. It’s of a hand on a cave, it seemed so strangely present. The hand mark had been created via red ochre blown over the hand. It made me think of the handprints I have hanging above my desk, nothing so sacred but from my childhood, my tiny hands on a red sheet of construction paper with fake white snow blown over them to leave my handprints red.The book then jumps down the rabbit hole into the lives of burrowers. Those that start digging for a logical purpose and end up spending decades digging because something about being down there grabs them. And then the author wrote of underground castles and cities. It was just fascinating. He also wrote of being lost and how that puts everything into question, including ones very nature. How being lost is a meditation you get up from and the world looks completely different. That is enlightenment. It also explains a lot of rituals which include being lost as part of transitioning into something or someone else. I really liked mention of the graffiti artist who took more than 200 pages of his journal, or parts of those pages, and painted them all over, or rather under, the city. It spoke of ancient times as well as modern times. In reality, he hid them where hardly anyone will ever see them except those who are willing to venture into hidden away places. It was very punk rock. The author then goes to look at ancient cave paintings. The entire chapter on underground art was seriously fascinating. In the next chapter he wrote of the Jacques Cousteau of the underworld. Someone that lives in caves or underground for a time to test his reactions. The author then tried his own 24 hour experiment in darkness in a cave. Alongside this he wrote of our first studies of sensory depravation. Fascinating read all the way around. For the last chapter, the author ventured to ancient Mayan grounds. It was fascinating to read about the Mayan’s making sacrifices in caves before they perished. I know I keep using the word fascinating but the whole book seriously was just that. In the end, the author makes the point that we as a people are obsessed with illumination, so much so we almost treat the unknown as criminal. When in truth, being lost in the dark is the only way we ever find ourselves. We so often forget there is beauty in what we cannot see or say."
5,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,4,"This little book is amazing as it mixes several aspects of the author's adventures caving all over the world. As a young teenager he found a tunnel in his back yard which he explored and became an obsessive adventurer of the underground world.He started with the world below the streets of NYC which hold many secrets; graffiti, concealed and disused stations, people who are a culture of their own who live in the darkness, and much more. He then moved on to Paris and the famous catacombs that criss cross the metropolis.He expanded his travels and visited caves, usually in rural areas, all over the world. He talked with the indigenous populations and learned of the religious meanings connected to these caves. He meditated in the darkness and measured the physical/psychological changes that occurred as he sat in complete darkness as much as a mile below the surface. He found that it was a frightening but enlightening experience as he saw hallucinations and heard voices and music.His mixture of exploration and the psychological effects of deep caving are fascinating. It may be a rather obscure subject but is well worth the read. Recommended. "
6,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115625-thefourthvine,3,"And this is why it is inadvisable to take recommendations from Overdrive, I guess, because I'm sure this book would be great for someone, but it was a resounding meh for me.The book is part travelogue, part philosophical meandering, and here's the thing: I am always here for travel stories, but you have to earn your wittering on about the human psyche and the universal urge and blah blah numinous liminal holy blah. You also have to keep the ratio of actual narrative to things you think about when you can't sleep at night pretty high. Hunt does not do those things, and so this is not the book for me. The travel bits were interesting enough, but I am going to need to spend a LOT of time reading about spaceships and/or banging to take the taste of Hunt's Beliefs About Caves and the Way All Humans Feel About Them away. "
7,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91249216-isa,5,"Underground is one of the most poetic, breathtaking and ambitious books I have read in a long time. Hunt offers a delightful and unexpected journey, a fantastic expedition full of discoveries, surprising facts and wonderful anecdotes. He is a clever and tenacious explorer, who places himself as an illuminating guide through the most secretive and curious places in a world I never suspected could exist. It is a boundary-breaking tale set between past legends and rituals, secret tunnels alive right beneath our feet, sacred caves existing since eternity, and incredible scientific expeditions digging though the earth. I can't recommend enough this beautiful and surprising piece of work which I read from cover to cover in a chill of excitement and curiosity. Fantastic!!"
8,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91301764-flint-bill,5,"One of the best works of non-fiction I've read in a while. Elegantly written, meticulously researched. Hunt went everywhere for this book! So many discoveries to be made about the world's caves, catacombs, mines, sewers and other holes in the ground. And it's beautifully illustrated. Recommend a hundred times over. "
9,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91471959-r-littlefield,5,"This non-fiction work starts off as a personal, memoir exploration of the author's preoccupation with subterranean worlds and expands into a much broader investigation, which ultimately explores the very roots of human spirituality. A unique and poetic and illuminating read. "
10,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8099838-nicolaus-stengl,5,"“Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet” is an extraordinarily well-researched book about the cavernous realm just beneath us. Will Hunt is our Virgil, guiding us into and through the subterranean world, and enthusing this tour with erudition, vitality, and an explorer’s yearning to explore our world and our place in it.	Will Hunt’s writing masterfully evokes W.G. Sebald; he mixes travelogue, biography, autobiography, history, science, documentary, and literary criticism. And in  Underground  Hunt’s writing evinces an encyclopedic knowledge and excitement of all things subterranean. Underground succeeds in giving us a panorama of the places below us and these spaces relate to humans throughout history. 	Anaxagoras said, “The descent to hell is the same from every place.” Underground shows us that all descents into the spaces beneath us, also are descents and explorations into what it means to be human."

This book travels (literally) into many different types of underground and goes into the historical, religious, and artistic aspects of each. Very engaging writing style and well edited, i thought this book was wonderful. I received a free review copy odd this book in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own."
12,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29796872-sara,5,"This books combines basically all of my favorite things: travel, exploration, photography, graffiti, archaeology, anthropology....with a splash of philosophy. The author is present in the narrative but not irritatingly so. The book feels personal without feeling autobiographical. I want to read a full book on just about every chapter - the mythology and consistent fascination with the underground throughout human history is truly fascinating."
13,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32212940-out-of-the-bex,4,"A love letter to a lost world.Will Hunt chronicles his search for meaning in the oft undiscovered world beneath our feet with a work that is part travel journal, part anthropological study. Hunt writes of his numerous explorations underground from the catacombs of Paris and the vast tunnels of NYC, to untouched caves in South America and Australia—and everything in between. His thoughtful commentary remarks on the discoveries of some of history’s greatest minds juxtaposed with that of the common traveler turned dirt evangelist, a commentary proving that an enduring and utterly human fascination with the underground world has always existed and will exist inevitably into the future.Perhaps enhanced by the otherworldly circumstances in which these events took place, it’s clear Hunt has a gift for understanding the importance of narrative even in nonfiction. He reports real happenings as if a story and does so in a voice that is at times conversational, at times introspective. A writing style that in itself requires digging into. Each chapter is a thoughtful thirty pages in which Hunt alternates his own stories of adventure and discovery with reverent tales of the explorers who came before him.WHAT WOULD I CHANGEUNDERGROUND is written with a mesmerizing prose designed to incite wonder, but descriptions seem always only half cast, as though the author is not fully willing to share every secret. Perhaps we can’t begrudge these withholdings. After all, adventure belongs solely to the adventurer himself. We, the reader and witness, are allowed only the glimpse we deserve from the safety of our armchairs, lit with reading lamps and a comfortable cup of tea at our side. Some things must be left undiscovered and undocumented, left for our own internal meanderings which I believe the author hopes to inspire by his documentation of a subsurface largely unknown.Two notes on structure stand out as what I could see as potential improvements. Firstly, the sentence structure itself, which acts as a sort of start and stop hap-dash of commas and semicolons thar far exceeds the average. This is due in part to the work’s conversational style, but does require some acclimating. Secondly, the book is punctuated with numerous black and white photos that sometimes lack full description. I would have appreciated the occasional italicized caption with more detail.THE BOTTOM LINEThis startling and thought-provoking work unearths a connection to the depths at once spiritual and biological, a revelation that astounds even the most casual of readers. A must-read for the spare traveller, the amateur archaeologist, the pioneer, the naturalist, the spiritualist, the dreaming anthropologist—but most importantly, the lingering explorer who lies buried in the hidden cavities of every human soul. VERDICT: Buy It"

Hunt is a fantastic writer, who manages to make his trips to these various places both scary and charming, and does an excellent job of conveying the importance and fascination of the history surrounding it all. I learned so many things I didn't know before, and want to spew these facts at everyone I know, which I consider a mark of greatness in nonfiction. Definitely read.Thanks Edelweiss for an e-arc!

16,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"https://booksnooks.wordpress.com/2019...Beneath my feet lies a 300 million-year-old petrified rainforest– the second largest in the world. Pictures of it can be seen here. It’s incredible to imagine that this snowy countryside was once a tropical rainforest and that its remains are now buried deep below where I stand today. Scientific proof of what once was. Do you ever wonder about what used to be? Do you wonder about what can’t be seen.Will Hunt’s curiosity about the unknown began the summer he turned 16, when he discovered an abandoned train tunnel that ran under his neighborhood. It was this experience that eventually launched his passion for urban exploring- a hobby that allowed him to travel all over the world as he sought out abandoned subway platforms (ghost stations), dodged police officers in foreign countries, and encountered “Mole People”. While in the Catacombs of Paris, he even came across an underground library, La Librairie, where urban explorers left books for others to borrow. Oh, my soul!""I saw that we- all of us, the human species- have always felt a quiet pull from the underground, that we are connected to this realm as we are to our own shadow.""I must say my favorite bit may have been the story about the “Mole Man of Hackney” who decided to dig a wine cellar in his basement and never stopped. He kept burrowing until his home started to collapse. In his words, “I just have a big basement.”Underground by Will Hunt was fascinating and really well done! If you are a fan of traveling from your couch or, like me, are simply saving your cabbage and working all the side hustles so you can travel in real life, this is the book for you! Hearing about his expeditions energized my sense of adventure and learning the science of the “worlds beneath our feet” caused me to look at things from a whole new perspective. Microbiologists keep finding life deeper and deeper inside the earth and are even discovering pockets of water that are more than a billion years old. In addition, it’s estimated that more than half of the world’s caves are undiscovered! We explore outer space, but there is so much to find here- our oceans and underground landscapes are just as much a mystery."

18,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1650596-joyce,4,"This is the kind of quirky book that I love--lots of history, geography, geology, literature, psychology, religion, all tied to a single idea: underground spaces, natural and man-made, and how they've been used over the millennia. I'd never consider going caving myself--I'm way too claustrophobic--but I enjoy reading about the pleasures and all that is to be found. Hunt recounts his research into these spaces from ancient caves to disused subway tunnels and offers an amazing array of facts (or perhaps trivia for fans of that) to be enjoyed. He writes about ""pioneers"" in the field and shares his encounters with modern underground explorers. The book is fairly brief and moves quite briskly from one adventure to the next, with bits of philosophizing slowing it slightly. Lots of literary references, as any number of books from classics to more recent titles have played with this idea, and he also brings in real people, like Picasso, who were strongly influenced by their own glimpses into these underground worlds. It's thought-provoking, informative, rich in mythology, religion, art, history. The writing is detailed and evocative, the setting often exotic. An earnest yet entertaining read. Hunt's personal journeys underline the universal nature of man's curiosity about hidden places. "

And also learn the importance of ochre? Who woulda figured that Will Hunt would get lost in the Parisian catacombs with two lovely women and write about it in such as way to make you feel panicky? He also explains exactly why and how the fear of being lost in the dark is so overwhelming.I really enjoyed this book. Hunt not only explores the actual underground spaces from New York to Australia and Paris to Mexico, but extends his exploration to how underground space has influenced the human psyche and behavior from the beginning. He talks about the psychology of being underground, the role underground spaces play in various religious beliefs around the world and even how life may have evolved deep underground rather than in a the hot soup at the surface.Do yourself a favor. Pick this book up. It's a highly entertaining and quick read. "
21,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310118-jeimy,4,"I just want Will Hunt to invite me to explore some of his favorite underground haunts. This book was riveting not only because of the places and characters we meet, but also the writing style."
22,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6016465-lauri,5,"I loved this book, I can't recommend it enough. First of all, it is beautifully written - Will Hunt is an Author, in the truest sense of the word. Second, it is much more than just an exploration of underground spaces around the world - an abandoned train tunnel in my own city of Providence, the catacombs in Paris, prehistoric caves in Europe, sewers and old subway stations in NYC, and whole underground cities in Turkey. It is an examination of what it means to be human. Journeying into the unknown, looking for reasons why so many cultures hold subterranean spaces sacred, sharing the origin stories of humanity from around the world - this book will give you a whole new perspective on the world beneath our feet, as well as the world around you. "
23,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76596-kirsty,5,"I loved this – the writing is beautiful and I dog-eared so many pages to refer back to. As a claustrophobe I will never, ever understand the desire to go deep underground – I honestly can't think of anything worse. But Will Hunt does a great job of exploring the push-pull of desire and fear that draws people underground, both now and throughout history. "
24,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3246839-john-machata,5,"Erudite, odd exploration of the world little known to most of us. Wonderful story teller. Worth reading for anyone interested in human existence."
25,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8111350-kendra,5,"Will Hunt writes about being underground so well that I actually experienced a touch of claustrophobia reading this book. It's a terrific read: one very individual lifelong interest in what lies beneath our cities, fields, farms, mountains, and deserts. Hunt goes caving and lives with the dark in numerous places and with complete respect for the cultures into whose caves he ventures.I loved learning about how cave spirits are universal, that the worship of cave deities is common, that caves have preserved far more art and archaeological information than just cave paintings. My only complaint is that the photos desperately need captions. In the Kindle version I read, none of the photos were captioned, so I often wasn't sure what I was looking at. Add those in, and you've got a book everyone who has ever wondered about what's under their feet will love."

27,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61920910-jypsy,4,"Underground delves into a subject that most of us never think about. What is going on underground? This book explores that question in fascinating ways. Subways, tunnels, and many places we know nothing about. People live and die underground. It is its own culture. I recommend this book for everyone. It's a good idea to know what is going on underground. Thanks to NetGalley for an arc in exchange for an honest review."

30,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4492706-babbs,4,"3.5 rounded up Hunt explores the cities within or more accurately beneath cities. These were some of the most enjoyable chapters for me, as Hunt describes how cities like NYC and Paris evolved overtime and how that evolution left a sometimes un- or at least under-known world. The author gives his reasons for a fascination with the ""dark zone"" and how it inspired his work and travel. He also explores religious ties to caves and the underground, and our interaction with darkness and the psychological toll that can have. Some parts I enjoyed more than others but overall a pleasant read and I even learned a few things! My only criticism would have been to include captions with the photos. In a few chapters with more rapid changing topics the ebook photos were harder to make out so a caption would have helped (even including a little more specific detail would have helped to put faces to many of the names mentioned)."
31,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,3,"Falls short in contentThere is so much below us - subways, water pipes, sewage, electrical wires, etc - that have helped create the society we know. Yet the book focuses on the role of the underground in folklore and religion, which was I found only somewhat interesting. The book was also memoir, but this part was also bland. Memoirs can be worked well into stories like this, for example “The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs,” by Steve Brusatte or “Built on Bones,” by Brenna Hassett. Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
32,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,3,"A collection of essays about underground spaces: man-made tunnels, underground cities and burrow livings, deep-earth mines, natural caves, sacred caves, etc..., part history part travel writing, and occasional dip into scientific studies. I like the chapters about New York subway tunnels and Paris catacombs. I find myself frowning at the author's reflection on his own cave dwelling experiment and arguments on altered consciousness and religious experiences--neither scientific nor philosophical. Instead, the author tried to conclude too much from too little evidence."

34,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69918114-jasen,4,"I played in the storm drains of my neighborhood as a kid but never had the call of the wild to go as deep as Will does; all over the world to explore dark, dank, deep, and wildly spiritual places. Wonderful read that seems to get stretched a bit in places, is has a good map of underground places to explore in individual lives, geography, literature, myth, spirit, and wonder. Some quotes:“Down any underground hollow, we feel, if not a full tempest of panic, a reflexive tingle of not quite rightness, as we imagine ceilings and walls closing in.on us.” P.27“ you go underground to die, but also to be reborn, to emerge from the room of the earth; we dread the underground, first refuge in times in danger; conceals priceless treasures, alongside toxic waste; the underground is the realm of repressed memory end of luminous revelation.” P.30“It is no surprise, then, that when we do lose our bearings, we are cast into a primal, bitter-in-the-mouth panic. Many of our most elementary fears—being separated from loved ones, uprooted from home, left out in the dark—are permutations of the dread of being lost. In our fairy tales, it is when the fair maiden becomes disoriented in the gloomy forest that she is accosted by the menacing troll or the hooded crone.” P.152“The surveys and maps that emerged from these early expeditions were often so divergent from reality that some caves are now effectively unrecognizable. Today, we can only read the old reports as small, mysterious poems about imaginary places.” P.159“And yet, they went down again and again. They lowered themselves into uncharted hollows, where no human had set foot before them, where the residents of local villages would not even peer over a rocky ledge for fear of spirits dwelling below.” P.161“Lostness has always been an enigmatic and many-sided state, always riven with unexpected potencies. Across history, all varieties of artists, philosophers, and scientists have celebrated disorientation as an engine of discovery and creativity, both in the sense of straying from a physical path, but also in swerving away from the familiar, turning in to the unknown.” P.163“Something In us has withered. We in the West have become hardened to the world, numb to certain shadowy textures in nature, dulled to what David Abram called the “songs, cries and gestures of the earth.” P. 265“The underground teaches us to respect mystery. We love in a world obsessed with illumination, where we blaze floodlights over every secret, strive to reveal every furrow, to root out every last trace of darkness, as though it were a kind of vermin. In our connection to subterranean space, we ease our suspicion of the unknown, and recognize that not everything should be revealed, not all the time.” P.265"
35,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7050149-susan-olesen,5,"Wow. What a book!Hunt is a cave lover from his youth, and recounts a life of exploring things underground, from traveling the length of Paris through underground warrens and tunnels, the abandoned tunnels and chasms under NYC inhabited by the forgotten. He takes you along on explorations of sacred Aboriginal caves, visits privately owned caves with relics that date back 14,000 years, to the multitude of Mayan caves, where most relics date back to 850 AD, when a massive drought created a panic and people made sacrifices to the rain gods in every cave they could find all over the jungle. He follows scientists a mile deep under the Black Hills to look for bacteria that shouldn’t exist – but do in such conditions. He spends a chapter discussing the psychological and physical effects of the absolute blackness in caves, how such sensory deprivation affects the mind, and how it has been used since the beginning of history as a means to “communicate with the Gods.” He discusses how the extreme sensory deprivation can drive people insane, unable to find their way out of caves, or chasing images that their mind has made up (think Injun Joe in Tom Sawyer). He discusses how man, since his first consciousness, has always looked for the divine inside caves – a universal pattern in every culture, on every continent. I found the book difficult to put down. I had to hear more, from incident to incident. Although, to my surprise, I’ve discovered that when pushed I am claustrophobic to a degree, I wish I had the nerve to explore such places myself. I have ridden the subway in NY. I’ve been through Howe Caverns once, but I don’t think I could do it again. It’s not the cave, or the darkness, or the bats, or that really tight spot fat people won’t fit through (I remember that spot, decades later), but that damned long elevator ride to the bottom. Depth is just height upside down, and it’s the height that stops me cold. If you love adventure, if you love culture or anthropology or psychology or caves, this book is an utter delight on every page."
36,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10848604-allison,5,"This book was simply fascinating. I can't decide what parts were my favorite- the Paris catacombs, the Cappadocia underground areas (the cross section picture is wild), the ant tunnels model in metal, the bit about underground microbiology, the buffaloes hidden way back in the cave, and gosh so much more. So interesting to read about all these hidden parts of our world, all just still ""there,"" every day of our lives. Seriously. I loved following the author's adventures around the world, how very cool to be able to do all that, and I enjoyed reading all the background and beliefs of these places and people. It really is a wild, cool, interesting world. At some point I wondered, too, how climate changes will affect some of these places as well, even though they are mostly hidden, but still... In any case, what a world! I'm glad to have been shown and made aware of so much more than we can even see, places I'll never go. I do wish each picture had a better caption (besides just being ""related"" to ""something"" on those two pages nearby, but often I wanted to know, which thing or exactly where...)."
37,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2423005-eden,5,"2019 bk 151. This book is a keeper. It is a memoir of the underground life Will Hunt has encountered in his years as first an urban explorer (beginning about age 11) to his developing interest in all things underground. He takes us on his journey into the subterranean subway, train, and utility tunnels of Providence, Rhode Island, New York City, and Paris. Caves that are important encounters with man's earliest history are visited in Australia, France, and the United States. Along the way there are encounters with strange animal creatures, admiration of ants, people whose lives revolve around spelunking or scientific exploration. Will also encounters the spiritual lives of past and present on each continent and in himself. I was so fascinated with this book that I fixed supper while reading it, and now I have the urge to pay another visit to Mammoth Cave."
38,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"I have a lifelong fascination with underground places (I blame Tolkien and Infocom games), so I was happy to find this well-written, thoughtful book. It's not so much a history as an exploration of how underground places function as cultural symbols. As someone who read and writes in the fantasy genre, I really enjoyed thinking about the anthropological and mythic dimensions of our relationships with built and natural landscapes.Also, I had the song from Labyrinth in my head the whole time I was reading, but that's neither here nor there."
39,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10482145-brian,5,"I loved this book. The subject matter involved something I've never really considered: the relationship between humans and going underground. Each chapter was a separate ""case study"" interwoven with the author's own experiences. Though the book contains some photographs, I found myself looking up many different structures, artwork, human remains, that the author discussed. There's a lot of interesting info in this book I had never heard of before. The writing altered between facts, prose, and poetry. You could feel how much the author cared for the experiences he described. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend. ...I really want to go explore some caves. "

This book discusses the author's experiences in caves, catacombs, sewers, subway tunnels ... Underground spaces, and the fascination we have for them are the subject of this book and the obsession of this writer. He finds inspiration in the deep places of the Earth, finding them areas of holiness and reverence. It's remarkably interesting and highly recommended!"

46,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983888-brooks,4,"I thought this would be a similar to Mary Roach – a book filled with trivia structured around humorous stories of how the author immersed themselves into the subject and interacted with experts in the field. It is, but Will Hunt is obsessed with his subject – he is an urban caver and has traveled the world caving. And he is a beautiful writer. I had grown accustomed to fair writing in this genre of geek non-fiction. His description of subway tunnels – “Down in sunken alleys, I enjoyed seeing textures of the city that were invisible to people on the surface – ancient graffiti tags, cracks in the foundation of skyscrapers, exotic molds creeping over walls… New York and I shared secrets”. He lived in New York and joined the Urban explorers there – and became obsessed with exploring the subway – seeking off the platforms at night and tracking down a notorious graffiti artist. He also travels to South Dakota to go down to the deepest mine with scientists looking for bacteria. There are is more biomass under the surface than on top – maybe life on earth originated underground and “microbe pioneers invaded the surface from below”. There are caves all of the world. One chapter compares the human caves of Cappadocia and ants colonies. He visits with an ant biologists in Florida who pours molten zinc into ant hills to create a 3D structure of their homes - really beautiful. Then compares these to an Cappadocia cave where a river had eroded the sides and they look similar. All animals go underground for safety - even during the cold war - we built bomb shelters in the ground. He finishes the book by challenging himself to spend 24 hours in a cave with no light – as expected he has visions as his eyes adjust to no stimulus – just as human cultures have done for all of history. All major religions have a tie to caves. Mt Sinai – this is the cave that were the source of the 10 commandments. Mohammed received the word of god in a cave. Pythagoras and DaVinci were obsessed with caves "
47,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26388383-john-jack,4,"Fascinating account of underground caves and their surrounding phenomena. Although middle stretches of chapters can thin out, Hunt is such a strong writer that he always pulls it together by the end. "
48,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404428-koen,4,"Excellent book about all things underground. No, not music or culturally but literally. Caves, subway tunnels, burrows and the like.The book took a quite different turn then i expected. I pretty much only knew the book was written by an urban adventurer and i was set for a book of exciting stories about urban underground spaces, run ins with authorities. While there is some of that, this book goes much deeper. (pun intended)Hunt not only explores underground spaces from New York to Australia and Paris to Mexico, what makes this book is his exploration of underground space as a metaphysical concept. He talks about the psychology of being underground, the role underground spaces play in various religious beliefs, how people, despite being ill equipped for underground living, are drawn to underground spaces but also the dangers of it and how even life may have evolved deep underground rather than in a the hot soup at the surface. Loads of interesting angles in a wide variety of subjects and written in an engaging way. Lovely book."

Interesting glimpses surely, though I didn't really want the endless, inane personal observations on fear of underground, urban explorers and himself. What might have been cooler to read is a book ala Mary Roach style, instead we get meandering depictions of underground structures and author's own psychobabble. My Rating - 3/5"
56,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17886872-will-hubbard,5,"Fascinating human history on our natural curiosity about all things underground. The author, who would be a top five dinner party guest, connects and illustrates several places in the world beneath us that make you want to drop everything and tag along with him. I especially enjoyed the chapters on the disorienting and transcendent psychology of darkness, the hidden Mayan caves in Mexico and Belize and exploring the Manhattan and Parisian undergrounds. Great pick for anyone who loves to wonder about our world."

In this book, rather successfully, Will Hunt tries to track down, analyze and distill humanity's allure for those secluded places down in the deep down dark.This is probably a four star book, for most people, heck, maybe even for me, but there's something in this book that speaks directly to my inclinations and proclivities."
58,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"I was hoping for recent history (last 300 years), but this is more cultural anthropology than anything.

I always feel a desire to be in a cave of some sort and now I realize that there are plenty of other people like me who feel that curious unease and pull. The places the author visits are varied and interesting and there was nothing in this book I found any less than absolutely fascinating. I was intrigued by the cover when I happened to see this book on a table at work (BN) and it did not disappoint. It will definitely be my staff recommendation this month. I feel it would be easy for a book like this to be lost in the shuffle of new books, but this one is really worth a read. This would interest history buffs, anyone curious about man's relationship with the unseen/unexplored, biologists, geologists, and anyone who has ever explored a cave. Pick this one up.

60,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3361474-jennifer,5,"Will Hunt's Underground is an exploration in every sense of the word, a tour de force tour of the physical, psychological, scientific, and mythic undergrounds that run beneath all of human history which illuminates what our fascination with the darkest of spaces says about us as a species.I admit I could be biased; after an opening chapter describing the childhood incident which sparked his fascination with caves and his initial underground explorations in New York City's subway tunnels, Hunt goes directly to my personal bucket list Mecca, the Paris Catacombs, interweaving the tale of his band of urban explorers' transverse across the city's subterranean world with the history of the 19th century photographer Nadar, who illuminated those same spaces with an arc lamp and first captured their likeness on collodion plates over 150 years ago. (I am literally the union of the Venn diagram of people interested in those two things.) From there, Hunt expands across the globe and throughout the ages, linking the beliefs of silver miners in the Andes with Aboriginal ochre miners in the Outback and drawing a connection between the 14,000 year-old cave paintings of Magdalenians and the mysterious diary of a reclusive grafitti artist in NYC.For as many subjects as he covers and as much research as he brings to bear, Hunt demonstrates a fantastically light touch with his narrative, which manages to be not only engaging and lucid but frequently poetic. If I have to find a nit to pick it's that the photos scattered throughout his text to document his travels and experiences are unlabeled and thus occasionally unclear as to their subject, with limited credits (and no commentary) appearing at the end of the book.Hunt's Underground raises interesting questions about the importance of hidden spaces to humanity and suggests some reasons for our endless fascination with the darkest of places. It's beautifully written and thoughtfully done, and I plan to spend the next year flinging copies of it at people to get them to read it."
61,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,4,"This book is hard to shelve, but I hope the multiplicity gives a good idea to the range of thought and reflection this book enfolds. It is not what I expected, which is a history of underground transportation, sewers, lighting, etc. in big cities, as the cover led me to believe. My fault--I ignored the bottom 1/3 of the cover which shows caves.So yes WH's underground involves sewers, underground transport, caves etc. It involves cities, early societies back to the earliest appearance of hominids, current cultures, religion, psychology. In short it deals with what WH sees as humankind (hominidkind?) fascination with going underground, how this has been done, and why. He has gone underground all around the world (save Antartica, but given the melting of the glaciers there perhaps that is not far off in his future). I've been in caves and liked them while on a tour, I've gone underground in one aqueduct in Rome, under the bottom of York Cathedral to see Roman remains, but I don't think I want to explore sewers without a map, compass, or cell phone/GPS access. WH does; he has also isolated himself in complete darkness for at least 24 hours. What prompts him and other subterranophiles to do this, what do they experience, and how do they react is the focus of this book.Of all the stories he tells, that of the San hunters visiting a private historical cave in France where the early human artists walked on their heels to make their sculptures is the most interesting. How the San deduced this and why they thought the artists did this I'll leave you to read.You are in for an amazing adventure!"
62,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8577532-lucy,4,"Do you think about what's below your feet? There may be caves, subways, sewers, tunnels, and other spaces below what we think of a solid ground.Will Hunt has spent much time exploring the spaces below the surface. He started near his him with an underground railway tunnel. He has explored subways in New York City, Paris, and other places. Not just riding the subway trains, but investigating the tunnels themselves, especially finding abandoned platforms, investigating the graffiti left by previous explorers. He and a couple of others almost managed to cross Paris underground. They did have to come up to the surface once to go a block or two to re-connect. They traversed subway tunnels, sewers, and catacombs.Paris and Rome are both renowned for their catacombs, places where the dead are relegated when cemeteries get too crowded. [He made no mention of exploring Rome's catacombs, just the Paris ones.]People live or have lived underground, often to escape invading armies, especially in Turkey in the Cappadocia region. At the height of the Cold War, people dug bomb shelters. In World War II, Londoners often spent the night in subway tunnels to escape the Blitz.Ancient humans left their marks in deep darkness in caves that require crawling to access.He's not alone in his fascination. He meets lots of other people who go below the surface to learn what's there.Chapters are: Descend, The Crossing, The Intraterrestrials, The Ochre Miners, The Burrowers, The lost, The Hidden Bison, The Dark Zone, The Cult.Really interesting and something most of us don't think about.

His descriptions of these places and stories of other people he encounters are beautiful and make you feel connected to the stories he tells. He treks through caves, catacombs, and subways while examining the cultures that worshiped and protected and were fascinated by these underground places. He travels into ancient Mayan caves with archaeologists, follows a graffiti artist's subway autobiography, and gets lost in the catacombs of Paris. He not only did a great job describing his own adventures, but also his historical research is never dry. His passion for the subject and all of its iterations drew me into his story and really, our story, of our fascination with subterranean worlds. This book manages to be both quirky and elegant."

The underground reminds us of what our ancestors always knew, that there is forever power and beauty in the unspoken and unseen.From his first experience discovering and exploring a tunnel that ran beneath his home in Providence, RI, Will Hunt felt a powerful and inexplicable pull to explore the realms of darkness. Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet is the culmination of years of plumbing the subterranean depths of subway stations and caves throughout the world for answers to the perplexing question of why predominantly light-seeking creatures are drawn into a world anathema to us. The Siren call of each new adventure was accompanied by extensive research into extant anthropological, scientific, and historical discoveries spanning several continents and many epochs and resulted in a beautifully crafted treatise on the vicissitudes of man's relationship with the underground.Particularly illustrative are the chapters including REVS, the graffiti artist who wrote his life story on walls in the darkest and most hidden recesses of New York City's transit system; Hunt's recounting of the Magdalenians' sculpture ""les bisons d'argile"" (clay bison), created fourteen thousand years ago and located more than a half mile inside a cave in the Pyrenees--the most deeply hidden artwork anywhere in the known world, exemplifying the connections between concealment and divinity, the sacred and the hidden; and the history of the Cave of the Crystal Sepulcher, evidence of the first ""dark-zone cult"" left by remnants of a desperate Mayan nation driven underground during the last years of the empire when drought was ravaging and bringing to an end that proud civilization.

From a theory that all life on earth originated underground, to the physiological and psychological effects of sensory deprivation, to the use of caves as sacred spaces, every chapter contained fascinating facts and intriguing observations.

The main takeaway for me was the unique experience of being underground— how we can experience non-rational emotions and visions by being underground.

Doing the exploring underground thing has been done many times. Yet as I dug further and further into the depths of this book, I found myself losing track of time and connection to everything around me which was a bit unnerving at first, but the literary country was hypnotic, spiritual and poetic so that by the time I was done, I reoriented myself back to the world outside the book, I found myself I bit wiser and a bit regretful that that my time there was so brief."

I graduated with a degree in anthropology and pre-professional archaeology, so I was immediately drawn to his book. Hunt does a great job describing different groups of people and the unique aspects of their cultures.Hunt’s description of the mental and physical experience when delving underground surfaced similar feelings in myself while I was reading.Hunt is able to paint a clear picture of the underground cities and caves; I think I might dapple in being a caver - tucking away my claustrophobia.

90,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3361474-jennifer,5,"Will Hunt's Underground is an exploration in every sense of the word, a tour de force tour of the physical, psychological, scientific, and mythic undergrounds that run beneath all of human history which illuminates what our fascination with the darkest of spaces says about us as a species.I admit I could be biased; after an opening chapter describing the childhood incident which sparked his fascination with caves and his initial underground explorations in New York City's subway tunnels, Hunt goes directly to my personal bucket list Mecca, the Paris Catacombs, interweaving the tale of his band of urban explorers' transverse across the city's subterranean world with the history of the 19th century photographer Nadar, who illuminated those same spaces with an arc lamp and first captured their likeness on collodion plates over 150 years ago. (I am literally the union of the Venn diagram of people interested in those two things.) From there, Hunt expands across the globe and throughout the ages, linking the beliefs of silver miners in the Andes with Aboriginal ochre miners in the Outback and drawing a connection between the 14,000 year-old cave paintings of Magdalenians and the mysterious diary of a reclusive grafitti artist in NYC.For as many subjects as he covers and as much research as he brings to bear, Hunt demonstrates a fantastically light touch with his narrative, which manages to be not only engaging and lucid but frequently poetic. If I have to find a nit to pick it's that the photos scattered throughout his text to document his travels and experiences are unlabeled and thus occasionally unclear as to their subject, with limited credits (and no commentary) appearing at the end of the book.Hunt's Underground raises interesting questions about the importance of hidden spaces to humanity and suggests some reasons for our endless fascination with the darkest of places. It's beautifully written and thoughtfully done, and I plan to spend the next year flinging copies of it at people to get them to read it."
91,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,4,"This book is hard to shelve, but I hope the multiplicity gives a good idea to the range of thought and reflection this book enfolds. It is not what I expected, which is a history of underground transportation, sewers, lighting, etc. in big cities, as the cover led me to believe. My fault--I ignored the bottom 1/3 of the cover which shows caves.So yes WH's underground involves sewers, underground transport, caves etc. It involves cities, early societies back to the earliest appearance of hominids, current cultures, religion, psychology. In short it deals with what WH sees as humankind (hominidkind?) fascination with going underground, how this has been done, and why. He has gone underground all around the world (save Antartica, but given the melting of the glaciers there perhaps that is not far off in his future). I've been in caves and liked them while on a tour, I've gone underground in one aqueduct in Rome, under the bottom of York Cathedral to see Roman remains, but I don't think I want to explore sewers without a map, compass, or cell phone/GPS access. WH does; he has also isolated himself in complete darkness for at least 24 hours. What prompts him and other subterranophiles to do this, what do they experience, and how do they react is the focus of this book.Of all the stories he tells, that of the San hunters visiting a private historical cave in France where the early human artists walked on their heels to make their sculptures is the most interesting. How the San deduced this and why they thought the artists did this I'll leave you to read.You are in for an amazing adventure!"

There may be caves, subways, sewers, tunnels, and other spaces below what we think of a solid ground.Will Hunt has spent much time exploring the spaces below the surface. He started near his him with an underground railway tunnel. He has explored subways in New York City, Paris, and other places. Not just riding the subway trains, but investigating the tunnels themselves, especially finding abandoned platforms, investigating the graffiti left by previous explorers. He and a couple of others almost managed to cross Paris underground. They did have to come up to the surface once to go a block or two to re-connect. They traversed subway tunnels, sewers, and catacombs.Paris and Rome are both renowned for their catacombs, places where the dead are relegated when cemeteries get too crowded. [He made no mention of exploring Rome's catacombs, just the Paris ones.]People live or have lived underground, often to escape invading armies, especially in Turkey in the Cappadocia region. At the height of the Cold War, people dug bomb shelters. In World War II, Londoners often spent the night in subway tunnels to escape the Blitz.Ancient humans left their marks in deep darkness in caves that require crawling to access.He's not alone in his fascination. He meets lots of other people who go below the surface to learn what's there.Chapters are: Descend, The Crossing, The Intraterrestrials, The Ochre Miners, The Burrowers, The lost, The Hidden Bison, The Dark Zone, The Cult.Really interesting and something most of us don't think about.

It is not what I expected, which is a history of underground transportation, sewers, lighting, etc. in big cities, as the cover led me to believe. My fault--I ignored the bottom 1/3 of the cover which shows caves.So yes WH's underground involves sewers, underground transport, caves etc. It involves cities, early societies back to the earliest appearance of hominids, current cultures, religion, psychology. In short it deals with what WH sees as humankind (hominidkind?) fascination with going underground, how this has been done, and why. He has gone underground all around the world (save Antartica, but given the melting of the glaciers there perhaps that is not far off in his future). I've been in caves and liked them while on a tour, I've gone underground in one aqueduct in Rome, under the bottom of York Cathedral to see Roman remains, but I don't think I want to explore sewers without a map, compass, or cell phone/GPS access. WH does; he has also isolated himself in complete darkness for at least 24 hours. What prompts him and other subterranophiles to do this, what do they experience, and how do they react is the focus of this book.Of all the stories he tells, that of the San hunters visiting a private historical cave in France where the early human artists walked on their heels to make their sculptures is the most interesting. How the San deduced this and why they thought the artists did this I'll leave you to read.You are in for an amazing adventure!"

There may be caves, subways, sewers, tunnels, and other spaces below what we think of a solid ground.Will Hunt has spent much time exploring the spaces below the surface. He started near his him with an underground railway tunnel. He has explored subways in New York City, Paris, and other places. Not just riding the subway trains, but investigating the tunnels themselves, especially finding abandoned platforms, investigating the graffiti left by previous explorers. He and a couple of others almost managed to cross Paris underground. They did have to come up to the surface once to go a block or two to re-connect. They traversed subway tunnels, sewers, and catacombs.Paris and Rome are both renowned for their catacombs, places where the dead are relegated when cemeteries get too crowded.

At the height of the Cold War, people dug bomb shelters.

123,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53143500-kayla,5,"I expected this book to be good because the topic is interesting, but I was really blown away. I LOVE how Will Hunt writes, poetic but succinct and direct. This book could have been a thousand pages, but he moves briskly without making you feel rushed. His descriptions of these places and stories of other people he encounters are beautiful and make you feel connected to the stories he tells. He treks through caves, catacombs, and subways while examining the cultures that worshiped and protected and were fascinated by these underground places. He travels into ancient Mayan caves with archaeologists, follows a graffiti artist's subway autobiography, and gets lost in the catacombs of Paris. He not only did a great job describing his own adventures, but also his historical research is never dry. His passion for the subject and all of its iterations drew me into his story and really, our story, of our fascination with subterranean worlds. This book manages to be both quirky and elegant."
124,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871631-pammy,4,"As a former spelunker and ongoing archaeologist, I found the tales of underground worlds told by Mr Hunt fascinating! Some of the locations he details, such as Chee Chem Hah in Belize, are familiar to me. This author writes and describes with a passion bordering on obsession about the darkest of dark places that have both ""frightened and enchanted humans through the ages"".Hunt communicates with humor and reverence about his time spent exploring the places often forgotten by time. Through his connections, he's been permitted into places not seen by the general public. Those special places of grandeur are described to the reader with respect and awe. He analyzes his experiences and explains the psychological grandeur of sacred caves, catacombs, tombs, bunkers, and underground cities in ""more than twenty countries around the world"".Makes me want to strap on my headlamp , coveralls, and knee pads!"
125,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15273212-holly,4,"Ever since reading an article about the Paris catacombs, I was interested in exploring more about this culture, these people who descend below the earth. So when this was a kindle deal, I couldn't pass it up! But instead of just a recitation of stuff that this guy has found within the underground, I learned a lot about history and science and psychology, and about how closely-related we all are. I, myself, visited a copper mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan once, and never wanted to do that again. HAHAHA. It's a fear, being enclosed like that, and it's kind of nice to know that even people who love exploring caves and cities beneath the surface are not unshakable. That the fear of not just darkness, but the underground, is essentially human. This was fascinating, and I loved learning more about different cultures and their religious practices, things that were lost and discovered by accident, all of these people tied together by these holes in the earth."
126,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90941654-david-critchfield,4,"The author takes us with him as he narrates his own adventures beneath the surface, to unknown places, through hidden tunnels where outcasts dwell in jerry-rigged shanties, and to repositories of our deep-rooted fears. I admit to being a lover of subterranean adventure stories and hollow earth theories but my claustrophobic fear prevents me from experiencing the kind of mysteries that the author describes. I agree with da Vinci who once said, “two contrary emotions arose in me: fear and desire---fear of the threatening dark cavern, desire to see whether there were any marvelous things in it.” Reading this marvelous book is the next best thing to being there. As the author states in the opening chapter, “Our connection to the underground cracks a door into the inscrutable chambers of the human imagination. We go down to see what is unseen, unseeable—we go in search of illumination that can be found only in the dark."
127,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42324650-eric,4,"I received a free copy in exchange for a review. When I first heard about this book, I thought it was going to be about forgotten underground areas of civilizations past. And at first, that's exactly what it was. Hunt tells us about his first exposure to lost underground domains and how it sparked a lifelong passion. He continues to recount subsequent adventures, slowly going backwards in time, while relaying relative stories from the past and going into the effects and allure the underground has on humans. Eventually, Hunt breaks away from man-made caverns and takes us on adventures through natural caves with artifacts from some of humankind's earliest civilizations all the while speculating on the spiritual significance of traveling beneath the surface. All in all, a very enjoyable read that shined a light on aspects of our world that often go overlooked."
128,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63347367-matthew-j,5,"A darned fine read, this book gets into all kinds of crazy places, and it's great. Will Hunt became captivated by a tunnel when he was a boy, then rekindled that interest when he spotted some folks sneaking out of a subway tunnel. That starts his journey into the underworld, and around the world. From tracking across Paris almost entirely underground, to riding an elevator to the bottom of an insanely deep mine, to hanging out with an Australian Aborigine family and learning about the sacred paths to caves, Hunt gets his hands dirty and reveals some dark places within our world and our biology. Did we come from the ground? It holds a dual place in our lives, as source of life & comfort, and as dark hell. The book is bursting with interesting people, wild meditations on the nature of being, and more. The only stumbling point for me was in the conclusion, which dips a bit too far into the New Age mumbo jumbo realm for my tastes. Check this book out. It's really, really good."
129,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15606423-catherine,4,"The underground teaches us to respect mystery. . . . In our connection to subterranean space, we ease our suspicion of the unknown, and recognize that not everything should be revealed, not all the time. The underground helps us accept that there will always be lacunae, always blind spots. It reminds us that we are disorderly, irrational creatures, susceptible to magical thinking and flights of dreaming and bouts of lostness, and that these are our greatest gifts. The underground reminds us of what our ancestors always knew, that there is forever power and beauty in the unspoken and unseen.From his first experience discovering and exploring a tunnel that ran beneath his home in Providence, RI, Will Hunt felt a powerful and inexplicable pull to explore the realms of darkness. Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet is the culmination of years of plumbing the subterranean depths of subway stations and caves throughout the world for answers to the perplexing question of why predominantly light-seeking creatures are drawn into a world anathema to us. The Siren call of each new adventure was accompanied by extensive research into extant anthropological, scientific, and historical discoveries spanning several continents and many epochs and resulted in a beautifully crafted treatise on the vicissitudes of man's relationship with the underground.Particularly illustrative are the chapters including REVS, the graffiti artist who wrote his life story on walls in the darkest and most hidden recesses of New York City's transit system; Hunt's recounting of the Magdalenians' sculpture ""les bisons d'argile"" (clay bison), created fourteen thousand years ago and located more than a half mile inside a cave in the Pyrenees--the most deeply hidden artwork anywhere in the known world, exemplifying the connections between concealment and divinity, the sacred and the hidden; and the history of the Cave of the Crystal Sepulcher, evidence of the first ""dark-zone cult"" left by remnants of a desperate Mayan nation driven underground during the last years of the empire when drought was ravaging and bringing to an end that proud civilization. Written in a lyrical style, teaming with biblical, mythological, and historical allusions and documenting ""the ways we are repelled by the dark, and yet compelled by mysterious impulses to venture down into the earth,"" Will Hunt's Underground is as persuasive as it is enchanting--a seductive journey into the darker regions of the netherworld."
130,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8856549-audrey-driscoll,5,"I thought this was a more straightforward approach to the topic of things underground than Robert Macfarlane's Underland, which was also published in 2019. Like Macfarlane, Hunt writes about his own experiences, but uses them as starting points to look at human experiences of and attitudes toward being underground. From a theory that all life on earth originated underground, to the physiological and psychological effects of sensory deprivation, to the use of caves as sacred spaces, every chapter contained fascinating facts and intriguing observations. I'm left with the apparent paradox that to us creatures of earth's surface, underground spaces are at the same time realms of terror and irresistible attractions."
131,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/687658-josh,5,"The author writes masterfully, even reverently, about the darkest and most hidden places on Earth, from the middle of Australia to the middle of West Virginia, Paris to New York, Asia Minor to the Yucatán. The globetrotting exploration has a constant thrilling sense of danger and rebellion, as if the reader and the writer could be arrested, killed, or driven to madness at any moment. The subject of underground spaces is intrinsically interesting since they are so foreign and frightening to we sunlight-loving creatures. The writer’s skill and passion make it all the more captivating."
132,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4106063-katie,4,"My interest in things underground is, well, on a somewhat smaller scale than the author's, and I prefer to dig down to them methodically from the surface and stop while I can still see the sun than to crawl through dark tunnels, but there was plenty of my kind of underground thing, too. After all, if humans explore caves now, they certainly did in the past, too.Some of these places seem absolutely fascinating to visit -- at least until I realize that the entire time I was inside one of these caves, I would be worried that I'd never make it back out again. Otherwise I would love to see the unique sites out there, the ones seen by only a few."
133,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47155369-carter-hemphill,4,"Overall I enjoyed reading about where the author went to discover caves, sewer systems and old subway lines, although some of his visits were limited by his descriptions, where I wished I had more pictures to contain what he was experiencing. When he provided historical insight or other research about the site or included anecdotes about the people he met, I found that information more interesting. The main takeaway for me was the unique experience of being underground— how we can experience non-rational emotions and visions by being underground. The isolation, complete darkness and lack of direction underground can lead to almost psychological or religious sensations that go beyond our usual rationalthought. The scientific tests of sensory depredation of college students was fascinating. Also interesting was the link between solitude in caves and religious significant events in various religions. I agree with the author that we have lost the perception and awe of being underground."
134,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764551-katra,3,"I enjoyed this exploration of mankind's fascination with the worlds below their feet. Having spent a number of years as a cave guide, I understood the author's obsession with the underground realm. While this is by no means an exhaustive study, his breadth of assessment of catacombs, tunnels, subterranean cities, and, of course, caverns lead to psychological implications of safety, exploration, blindness, disorientation, and sacred spaces that inspired reflection. Well worth the read."

That starts his journey into the underworld, and around the world. From tracking across Paris almost entirely underground, to riding an elevator to the bottom of an insanely deep mine, to hanging out with an Australian Aborigine family and learning about the sacred paths to caves, Hunt gets his hands dirty and reveals some dark places within our world and our biology.

The underground helps us accept that there will always be lacunae, always blind spots. It reminds us that we are disorderly, irrational creatures, susceptible to magical thinking and flights of dreaming and bouts of lostness, and that these are our greatest gifts. The underground reminds us of what our ancestors always knew, that there is forever power and beauty in the unspoken and unseen.From his first experience discovering and exploring a tunnel that ran beneath his home in Providence, RI, Will Hunt felt a powerful and inexplicable pull to explore the realms of darkness. Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet is the culmination of years of plumbing the subterranean depths of subway stations and caves throughout the world for answers to the perplexing question of why predominantly light-seeking creatures are drawn into a world anathema to us. The Siren call of each new adventure was accompanied by extensive research into extant anthropological, scientific, and historical discoveries spanning several continents and many epochs and resulted in a beautifully crafted treatise on the vicissitudes of man's relationship with the underground.Particularly illustrative are the chapters including REVS, the graffiti artist who wrote his life story on walls in the darkest and most hidden recesses of New York City's transit system; Hunt's recounting of the Magdalenians' sculpture ""les bisons d'argile"" (clay bison), created fourteen thousand years ago and located more than a half mile inside a cave in the Pyrenees--the most deeply hidden artwork anywhere in the known world, exemplifying the connections between concealment and divinity, the sacred and the hidden; and the history of the Cave of the Crystal Sepulcher, evidence of the first ""dark-zone cult"" left by remnants of a desperate Mayan nation driven underground during the last years of the empire when drought was ravaging and bringing to an end that proud civilization. Written in a lyrical style, teaming with biblical, mythological, and historical allusions and documenting ""the ways we are repelled by the dark, and yet compelled by mysterious impulses to venture down into the earth,"" Will Hunt's Underground is as persuasive as it is enchanting--a seductive journey into the darker regions of the netherworld."

From a theory that all life on earth originated underground, to the physiological and psychological effects of sensory deprivation, to the use of caves as sacred spaces, every chapter contained fascinating facts and intriguing observations.

Doing the exploring underground thing has been done many times. Yet as I dug further and further into the depths of this book, I found myself losing track of time and connection to everything around me which was a bit unnerving at first, but the literary country was hypnotic, spiritual and poetic so that by the time I was done, I reoriented myself back to the world outside the book, I found myself I bit wiser and a bit regretful that that my time there was so brief."

Hunt does a great job describing different groups of people and the unique aspects of their cultures.Hunt’s description of the mental and physical experience when delving underground surfaced similar feelings in myself while I was reading.Hunt is able to paint a clear picture of the underground cities and caves; I think I might dapple in being a caver - tucking away my claustrophobia.

180,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3361474-jennifer,5,"Will Hunt's Underground is an exploration in every sense of the word, a tour de force tour of the physical, psychological, scientific, and mythic undergrounds that run beneath all of human history which illuminates what our fascination with the darkest of spaces says about us as a species.I admit I could be biased; after an opening chapter describing the childhood incident which sparked his fascination with caves and his initial underground explorations in New York City's subway tunnels, Hunt goes directly to my personal bucket list Mecca, the Paris Catacombs, interweaving the tale of his band of urban explorers' transverse across the city's subterranean world with the history of the 19th century photographer Nadar, who illuminated those same spaces with an arc lamp and first captured their likeness on collodion plates over 150 years ago. (I am literally the union of the Venn diagram of people interested in those two things.) From there, Hunt expands across the globe and throughout the ages, linking the beliefs of silver miners in the Andes with Aboriginal ochre miners in the Outback and drawing a connection between the 14,000 year-old cave paintings of Magdalenians and the mysterious diary of a reclusive grafitti artist in NYC.For as many subjects as he covers and as much research as he brings to bear, Hunt demonstrates a fantastically light touch with his narrative, which manages to be not only engaging and lucid but frequently poetic. If I have to find a nit to pick it's that the photos scattered throughout his text to document his travels and experiences are unlabeled and thus occasionally unclear as to their subject, with limited credits (and no commentary) appearing at the end of the book.Hunt's Underground raises interesting questions about the importance of hidden spaces to humanity and suggests some reasons for our endless fascination with the darkest of places. It's beautifully written and thoughtfully done, and I plan to spend the next year flinging copies of it at people to get them to read it."
181,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,4,"This book is hard to shelve, but I hope the multiplicity gives a good idea to the range of thought and reflection this book enfolds. It is not what I expected, which is a history of underground transportation, sewers, lighting, etc. in big cities, as the cover led me to believe. My fault--I ignored the bottom 1/3 of the cover which shows caves.So yes WH's underground involves sewers, underground transport, caves etc. It involves cities, early societies back to the earliest appearance of hominids, current cultures, religion, psychology. In short it deals with what WH sees as humankind (hominidkind?) fascination with going underground, how this has been done, and why. He has gone underground all around the world (save Antartica, but given the melting of the glaciers there perhaps that is not far off in his future). I've been in caves and liked them while on a tour, I've gone underground in one aqueduct in Rome, under the bottom of York Cathedral to see Roman remains, but I don't think I want to explore sewers without a map, compass, or cell phone/GPS access. WH does; he has also isolated himself in complete darkness for at least 24 hours. What prompts him and other subterranophiles to do this, what do they experience, and how do they react is the focus of this book.Of all the stories he tells, that of the San hunters visiting a private historical cave in France where the early human artists walked on their heels to make their sculptures is the most interesting. How the San deduced this and why they thought the artists did this I'll leave you to read.You are in for an amazing adventure!"

There may be caves, subways, sewers, tunnels, and other spaces below what we think of a solid ground.Will Hunt has spent much time exploring the spaces below the surface. He started near his him with an underground railway tunnel. He has explored subways in New York City, Paris, and other places. Not just riding the subway trains, but investigating the tunnels themselves, especially finding abandoned platforms, investigating the graffiti left by previous explorers. He and a couple of others almost managed to cross Paris underground. They did have to come up to the surface once to go a block or two to re-connect. They traversed subway tunnels, sewers, and catacombs.Paris and Rome are both renowned for their catacombs, places where the dead are relegated when cemeteries get too crowded. [He made no mention of exploring Rome's catacombs, just the Paris ones.]People live or have lived underground, often to escape invading armies, especially in Turkey in the Cappadocia region. At the height of the Cold War, people dug bomb shelters. In World War II, Londoners often spent the night in subway tunnels to escape the Blitz.Ancient humans left their marks in deep darkness in caves that require crawling to access.He's not alone in his fascination. He meets lots of other people who go below the surface to learn what's there.Chapters are: Descend, The Crossing, The Intraterrestrials, The Ochre Miners, The Burrowers, The lost, The Hidden Bison, The Dark Zone, The Cult.Really interesting and something most of us don't think about. Recommended."

It is not what I expected, which is a history of underground transportation, sewers, lighting, etc. in big cities, as the cover led me to believe. My fault--I ignored the bottom 1/3 of the cover which shows caves.So yes WH's underground involves sewers, underground transport, caves etc. It involves cities, early societies back to the earliest appearance of hominids, current cultures, religion, psychology. In short it deals with what WH sees as humankind (hominidkind?) fascination with going underground, how this has been done, and why. He has gone underground all around the world (save Antartica, but given the melting of the glaciers there perhaps that is not far off in his future). I've been in caves and liked them while on a tour, I've gone underground in one aqueduct in Rome, under the bottom of York Cathedral to see Roman remains, but I don't think I want to explore sewers without a map, compass, or cell phone/GPS access. WH does; he has also isolated himself in complete darkness for at least 24 hours. What prompts him and other subterranophiles to do this, what do they experience, and how do they react is the focus of this book.Of all the stories he tells, that of the San hunters visiting a private historical cave in France where the early human artists walked on their heels to make their sculptures is the most interesting. How the San deduced this and why they thought the artists did this I'll leave you to read.You are in for an amazing adventure!"

Not just riding the subway trains, but investigating the tunnels themselves, especially finding abandoned platforms, investigating the graffiti left by previous explorers.

I LOVE how Will Hunt writes, poetic but succinct and direct. This book could have been a thousand pages, but he moves briskly without making you feel rushed. His descriptions of these places and stories of other people he encounters are beautiful and make you feel connected to the stories he tells. He treks through caves, catacombs, and subways while examining the cultures that worshiped and protected and were fascinated by these underground places. He travels into ancient Mayan caves with archaeologists, follows a graffiti artist's subway autobiography, and gets lost in the catacombs of Paris. He not only did a great job describing his own adventures, but also his historical research is never dry. His passion for the subject and all of its iterations drew me into his story and really, our story, of our fascination with subterranean worlds. This book manages to be both quirky and elegant."
214,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871631-pammy,4,"As a former spelunker and ongoing archaeologist, I found the tales of underground worlds told by Mr Hunt fascinating! Some of the locations he details, such as Chee Chem Hah in Belize, are familiar to me. This author writes and describes with a passion bordering on obsession about the darkest of dark places that have both ""frightened and enchanted humans through the ages"".Hunt communicates with humor and reverence about his time spent exploring the places often forgotten by time. Through his connections, he's been permitted into places not seen by the general public. Those special places of grandeur are described to the reader with respect and awe. He analyzes his experiences and explains the psychological grandeur of sacred caves, catacombs, tombs, bunkers, and underground cities in ""more than twenty countries around the world"".Makes me want to strap on my headlamp , coveralls, and knee pads!"
215,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15273212-holly,4,"Ever since reading an article about the Paris catacombs, I was interested in exploring more about this culture, these people who descend below the earth. So when this was a kindle deal, I couldn't pass it up! But instead of just a recitation of stuff that this guy has found within the underground, I learned a lot about history and science and psychology, and about how closely-related we all are. I, myself, visited a copper mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan once, and never wanted to do that again. HAHAHA. It's a fear, being enclosed like that, and it's kind of nice to know that even people who love exploring caves and cities beneath the surface are not unshakable. That the fear of not just darkness, but the underground, is essentially human. This was fascinating, and I loved learning more about different cultures and their religious practices, things that were lost and discovered by accident, all of these people tied together by these holes in the earth."
216,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90941654-david-critchfield,4,"The author takes us with him as he narrates his own adventures beneath the surface, to unknown places, through hidden tunnels where outcasts dwell in jerry-rigged shanties, and to repositories of our deep-rooted fears. I admit to being a lover of subterranean adventure stories and hollow earth theories but my claustrophobic fear prevents me from experiencing the kind of mysteries that the author describes. I agree with da Vinci who once said, “two contrary emotions arose in me: fear and desire---fear of the threatening dark cavern, desire to see whether there were any marvelous things in it.” Reading this marvelous book is the next best thing to being there. As the author states in the opening chapter, “Our connection to the underground cracks a door into the inscrutable chambers of the human imagination. We go down to see what is unseen, unseeable—we go in search of illumination that can be found only in the dark."
217,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42324650-eric,4,"I received a free copy in exchange for a review. When I first heard about this book, I thought it was going to be about forgotten underground areas of civilizations past. And at first, that's exactly what it was. Hunt tells us about his first exposure to lost underground domains and how it sparked a lifelong passion. He continues to recount subsequent adventures, slowly going backwards in time, while relaying relative stories from the past and going into the effects and allure the underground has on humans. Eventually, Hunt breaks away from man-made caverns and takes us on adventures through natural caves with artifacts from some of humankind's earliest civilizations all the while speculating on the spiritual significance of traveling beneath the surface. All in all, a very enjoyable read that shined a light on aspects of our world that often go overlooked."
218,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63347367-matthew-j,5,"A darned fine read, this book gets into all kinds of crazy places, and it's great. Will Hunt became captivated by a tunnel when he was a boy, then rekindled that interest when he spotted some folks sneaking out of a subway tunnel. That starts his journey into the underworld, and around the world. From tracking across Paris almost entirely underground, to riding an elevator to the bottom of an insanely deep mine, to hanging out with an Australian Aborigine family and learning about the sacred paths to caves, Hunt gets his hands dirty and reveals some dark places within our world and our biology. Did we come from the ground? It holds a dual place in our lives, as source of life & comfort, and as dark hell. The book is bursting with interesting people, wild meditations on the nature of being, and more. The only stumbling point for me was in the conclusion, which dips a bit too far into the New Age mumbo jumbo realm for my tastes. Check this book out. It's really, really good."
219,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15606423-catherine,4,"The underground teaches us to respect mystery. . . . In our connection to subterranean space, we ease our suspicion of the unknown, and recognize that not everything should be revealed, not all the time. The underground helps us accept that there will always be lacunae, always blind spots. It reminds us that we are disorderly, irrational creatures, susceptible to magical thinking and flights of dreaming and bouts of lostness, and that these are our greatest gifts. The underground reminds us of what our ancestors always knew, that there is forever power and beauty in the unspoken and unseen.From his first experience discovering and exploring a tunnel that ran beneath his home in Providence, RI, Will Hunt felt a powerful and inexplicable pull to explore the realms of darkness. Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet is the culmination of years of plumbing the subterranean depths of subway stations and caves throughout the world for answers to the perplexing question of why predominantly light-seeking creatures are drawn into a world anathema to us. The Siren call of each new adventure was accompanied by extensive research into extant anthropological, scientific, and historical discoveries spanning several continents and many epochs and resulted in a beautifully crafted treatise on the vicissitudes of man's relationship with the underground.Particularly illustrative are the chapters including REVS, the graffiti artist who wrote his life story on walls in the darkest and most hidden recesses of New York City's transit system; Hunt's recounting of the Magdalenians' sculpture ""les bisons d'argile"" (clay bison), created fourteen thousand years ago and located more than a half mile inside a cave in the Pyrenees--the most deeply hidden artwork anywhere in the known world, exemplifying the connections between concealment and divinity, the sacred and the hidden; and the history of the Cave of the Crystal Sepulcher, evidence of the first ""dark-zone cult"" left by remnants of a desperate Mayan nation driven underground during the last years of the empire when drought was ravaging and bringing to an end that proud civilization. Written in a lyrical style, teaming with biblical, mythological, and historical allusions and documenting ""the ways we are repelled by the dark, and yet compelled by mysterious impulses to venture down into the earth,"" Will Hunt's Underground is as persuasive as it is enchanting--a seductive journey into the darker regions of the netherworld."
220,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8856549-audrey-driscoll,5,"I thought this was a more straightforward approach to the topic of things underground than Robert Macfarlane's Underland, which was also published in 2019. Like Macfarlane, Hunt writes about his own experiences, but uses them as starting points to look at human experiences of and attitudes toward being underground. From a theory that all life on earth originated underground, to the physiological and psychological effects of sensory deprivation, to the use of caves as sacred spaces, every chapter contained fascinating facts and intriguing observations. I'm left with the apparent paradox that to us creatures of earth's surface, underground spaces are at the same time realms of terror and irresistible attractions."
221,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/687658-josh,5,"The author writes masterfully, even reverently, about the darkest and most hidden places on Earth, from the middle of Australia to the middle of West Virginia, Paris to New York, Asia Minor to the Yucatán. The globetrotting exploration has a constant thrilling sense of danger and rebellion, as if the reader and the writer could be arrested, killed, or driven to madness at any moment. The subject of underground spaces is intrinsically interesting since they are so foreign and frightening to we sunlight-loving creatures. The writer’s skill and passion make it all the more captivating."
222,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4106063-katie,4,"My interest in things underground is, well, on a somewhat smaller scale than the author's, and I prefer to dig down to them methodically from the surface and stop while I can still see the sun than to crawl through dark tunnels, but there was plenty of my kind of underground thing, too. After all, if humans explore caves now, they certainly did in the past, too.Some of these places seem absolutely fascinating to visit -- at least until I realize that the entire time I was inside one of these caves, I would be worried that I'd never make it back out again. Otherwise I would love to see the unique sites out there, the ones seen by only a few."
223,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47155369-carter-hemphill,4,"Overall I enjoyed reading about where the author went to discover caves, sewer systems and old subway lines, although some of his visits were limited by his descriptions, where I wished I had more pictures to contain what he was experiencing. When he provided historical insight or other research about the site or included anecdotes about the people he met, I found that information more interesting. The main takeaway for me was the unique experience of being underground— how we can experience non-rational emotions and visions by being underground. The isolation, complete darkness and lack of direction underground can lead to almost psychological or religious sensations that go beyond our usual rationalthought. The scientific tests of sensory depredation of college students was fascinating. Also interesting was the link between solitude in caves and religious significant events in various religions. I agree with the author that we have lost the perception and awe of being underground."
224,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3764551-katra,3,"I enjoyed this exploration of mankind's fascination with the worlds below their feet. Having spent a number of years as a cave guide, I understood the author's obsession with the underground realm. While this is by no means an exhaustive study, his breadth of assessment of catacombs, tunnels, subterranean cities, and, of course, caverns lead to psychological implications of safety, exploration, blindness, disorientation, and sacred spaces that inspired reflection. Well worth the read."

From tracking across Paris almost entirely underground, to riding an elevator to the bottom of an insanely deep mine, to hanging out with an Australian Aborigine family and learning about the sacred paths to caves, Hunt gets his hands dirty and reveals some dark places within our world and our biology.

The underground helps us accept that there will always be lacunae, always blind spots. It reminds us that we are disorderly, irrational creatures, susceptible to magical thinking and flights of dreaming and bouts of lostness, and that these are our greatest gifts. The underground reminds us of what our ancestors always knew, that there is forever power and beauty in the unspoken and unseen.From his first experience discovering and exploring a tunnel that ran beneath his home in Providence, RI, Will Hunt felt a powerful and inexplicable pull to explore the realms of darkness. Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet is the culmination of years of plumbing the subterranean depths of subway stations and caves throughout the world for answers to the perplexing question of why predominantly light-seeking creatures are drawn into a world anathema to us. The Siren call of each new adventure was accompanied by extensive research into extant anthropological, scientific, and historical discoveries spanning several continents and many epochs and resulted in a beautifully crafted treatise on the vicissitudes of man's relationship with the underground.Particularly illustrative are the chapters including REVS, the graffiti artist who wrote his life story on walls in the darkest and most hidden recesses of New York City's transit system; Hunt's recounting of the Magdalenians' sculpture ""les bisons d'argile"" (clay bison), created fourteen thousand years ago and located more than a half mile inside a cave in the Pyrenees--the most deeply hidden artwork anywhere in the known world, exemplifying the connections between concealment and divinity, the sacred and the hidden; and the history of the Cave of the Crystal Sepulcher, evidence of the first ""dark-zone cult"" left by remnants of a desperate Mayan nation driven underground during the last years of the empire when drought was ravaging and bringing to an end that proud civilization. Written in a lyrical style, teaming with biblical, mythological, and historical allusions and documenting ""the ways we are repelled by the dark, and yet compelled by mysterious impulses to venture down into the earth,"" Will Hunt's Underground is as persuasive as it is enchanting--a seductive journey into the darker regions of the netherworld."

From a theory that all life on earth originated underground, to the physiological and psychological effects of sensory deprivation, to the use of caves as sacred spaces, every chapter contained fascinating facts and intriguing observations.

Doing the exploring underground thing has been done many times. Yet as I dug further and further into the depths of this book, I found myself losing track of time and connection to everything around me which was a bit unnerving at first, but the literary country was hypnotic, spiritual and poetic so that by the time I was done, I reoriented myself back to the world outside the book, I found myself I bit wiser and a bit regretful that that my time there was so brief."

270,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3361474-jennifer,5,"Will Hunt's Underground is an exploration in every sense of the word, a tour de force tour of the physical, psychological, scientific, and mythic undergrounds that run beneath all of human history which illuminates what our fascination with the darkest of spaces says about us as a species.I admit I could be biased; after an opening chapter describing the childhood incident which sparked his fascination with caves and his initial underground explorations in New York City's subway tunnels, Hunt goes directly to my personal bucket list Mecca, the Paris Catacombs, interweaving the tale of his band of urban explorers' transverse across the city's subterranean world with the history of the 19th century photographer Nadar, who illuminated those same spaces with an arc lamp and first captured their likeness on collodion plates over 150 years ago. (I am literally the union of the Venn diagram of people interested in those two things.) From there, Hunt expands across the globe and throughout the ages, linking the beliefs of silver miners in the Andes with Aboriginal ochre miners in the Outback and drawing a connection between the 14,000 year-old cave paintings of Magdalenians and the mysterious diary of a reclusive grafitti artist in NYC.For as many subjects as he covers and as much research as he brings to bear, Hunt demonstrates a fantastically light touch with his narrative, which manages to be not only engaging and lucid but frequently poetic. If I have to find a nit to pick it's that the photos scattered throughout his text to document his travels and experiences are unlabeled and thus occasionally unclear as to their subject, with limited credits (and no commentary) appearing at the end of the book.Hunt's Underground raises interesting questions about the importance of hidden spaces to humanity and suggests some reasons for our endless fascination with the darkest of places. It's beautifully written and thoughtfully done, and I plan to spend the next year flinging copies of it at people to get them to read it."
271,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32960023-judith,4,"This book is hard to shelve, but I hope the multiplicity gives a good idea to the range of thought and reflection this book enfolds. It is not what I expected, which is a history of underground transportation, sewers, lighting, etc. in big cities, as the cover led me to believe. My fault--I ignored the bottom 1/3 of the cover which shows caves.So yes WH's underground involves sewers, underground transport, caves etc. It involves cities, early societies back to the earliest appearance of hominids, current cultures, religion, psychology. In short it deals with what WH sees as humankind (hominidkind?) fascination with going underground, how this has been done, and why. He has gone underground all around the world (save Antartica, but given the melting of the glaciers there perhaps that is not far off in his future). I've been in caves and liked them while on a tour, I've gone underground in one aqueduct in Rome, under the bottom of York Cathedral to see Roman remains, but I don't think I want to explore sewers without a map, compass, or cell phone/GPS access. WH does; he has also isolated himself in complete darkness for at least 24 hours. What prompts him and other subterranophiles to do this, what do they experience, and how do they react is the focus of this book.Of all the stories he tells, that of the San hunters visiting a private historical cave in France where the early human artists walked on their heels to make their sculptures is the most interesting. How the San deduced this and why they thought the artists did this I'll leave you to read.You are in for an amazing adventure!"

There may be caves, subways, sewers, tunnels, and other spaces below what we think of a solid ground.Will Hunt has spent much time exploring the spaces below the surface. He started near his him with an underground railway tunnel. He has explored subways in New York City, Paris, and other places. Not just riding the subway trains, but investigating the tunnels themselves, especially finding abandoned platforms, investigating the graffiti left by previous explorers. He and a couple of others almost managed to cross Paris underground. They did have to come up to the surface once to go a block or two to re-connect. They traversed subway tunnels, sewers, and catacombs.Paris and Rome are both renowned for their catacombs, places where the dead are relegated when cemeteries get too crowded. [He made no mention of exploring Rome's catacombs, just the Paris ones.]People live or have lived underground, often to escape invading armies, especially in Turkey in the Cappadocia region. At the height of the Cold War, people dug bomb shelters. In World War II, Londoners often spent the night in subway tunnels to escape the Blitz.Ancient humans left their marks in deep darkness in caves that require crawling to access.He's not alone in his fascination. He meets lots of other people who go below the surface to learn what's there.Chapters are: Descend, The Crossing, The Intraterrestrials, The Ochre Miners, The Burrowers, The lost, The Hidden Bison, The Dark Zone, The Cult.Really interesting and something most of us don't think about. Recommended."

I LOVE how Will Hunt writes, poetic but succinct and direct. This book could have been a thousand pages, but he moves briskly without making you feel rushed. His descriptions of these places and stories of other people he encounters are beautiful and make you feel connected to the stories he tells. He treks through caves, catacombs, and subways while examining the cultures that worshiped and protected and were fascinated by these underground places. He travels into ancient Mayan caves with archaeologists, follows a graffiti artist's subway autobiography, and gets lost in the catacombs of Paris.

Doing the exploring underground thing has been done many times. Yet as I dug further and further into the depths of this book, I found myself losing track of time and connection to everything around me which was a bit unnerving at first, but the literary country was hypnotic, spiritual and poetic so that by the time I was done, I reoriented myself back to the world outside the book, I found myself I bit wiser and a bit regretful that that my time there was so brief."

I graduated with a degree in anthropology and pre-professional archaeology, so I was immediately drawn to his book. Hunt does a great job describing different groups of people and the unique aspects of their cultures.Hunt’s description of the mental and physical experience when delving underground surfaced similar feelings in myself while I was reading.Hunt is able to paint a clear picture of the underground cities and caves; I think I might dapple in being a caver - tucking away my claustrophobia.

Makes me want to visit caves, explore under cities, and be immersed in darkness (for a little bit). A fascinating take on how the underground interacted with humans throughout history and how our brains and minds still react to it."
289,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293241-kate,3,"This book was at times completely fascinating and at others a complete snooze. When the author stuck to talking about his experiences underground - whether in caves or manmade structures - and the history behind the areas he was exploring, I could hardly put the book down. But too often he would go off on philosophical or broad psychological tangents and it would turn into a slog."

291,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89827342-amber-g,3,"Fascinating, though less history and more anecdotal than I expected. My favorite chapter by far was the Parisian Catacombs, though all were interesting. "

293,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19402136-bryanna-plog,5,"Fantastic treatment of underground spaces around the world. A nice balance of Hunt's travels and descriptions, the history of a place, and philosophy. It will make me think of what's under my feet a lot more wherever I'm walking. (Also made for a great read on the NYC subway!)"

295,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3745392-tim-fiester,5,"A fascinating and informative book about humanity’s relationship with the worlds below ground and...possibly our origins. What’s more, for me this book was also inspiring, a spark of creative energy. "
296,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28578864-corinne-miller,3,Read like a good podcast. Well researched but I sometimes found myself disinterested in the topics.
297,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10292552-david,5,"Incrediblely written. Flows well between past and present. Research is well done. Full of solid quotes. If you like history, myth, journalism, and adventure rolled into one book, I highly recommend Will Hunt's Underground. 5-stars all around. "
298,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7866975-izzi-koning,5,"Great book, learnt a bunch of fascinating things and am inspired to dig deeper so to speak. If you’re interested in that ‘which lies beneath’, do yourself a favor and pick up this great read! "
299,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1620592-deanne,3,Interesting but not spectacular. Audio narrator was slightly annoying. Kinda makes me want to go explore some caves.
