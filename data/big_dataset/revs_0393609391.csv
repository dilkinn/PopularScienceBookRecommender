By the time I hit page twenty, I realized I was mentally absent as my eyes and mind processed words but failed to commit those words to actual thought. I wanted to love this book. I want you to love this book. Alas, I just felt overwhelmed.I recommend this book, but read it slowly and in small sittings.

Even at the basic level, with Tyson’s clear, funny and accessible writing, I found a lot of these concepts WAY over my head. Nevertheless, it is fascinating stuff. My big takeaway was humility: just how small humans are in the grand scheme of things, and there is something freeing about that. It reminded me of a fake headline on The Onion news satire site that made me chuckle: Obama Reassures Americans: ‘The future, and I’m talking three billion years from now, is still bright.”The amount we don’t know about the universe is staggering. Dark matter, dark energy . . . how can we be completely unaware of forces that make up the bulk of our universe? But also, how amazing is it that we can find this stuff out from our little speck of a planet in the suburbs of Nowheresville, Milky Way Galaxy? This is a short book, perfect, as the title says, for people in a hurry. If you would like your mind exploded by science, and get a few chuckles out of the deal, check it out!"

We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, within 224 pages, attempts to cover the entirety space and time. He does a pretty good job.  However,  this is not  Astrophysics for Dummies. There are assumptions made for the audience - you do need a bit of a working knowledge on particles and space to fully understand the significance of the text. That being said, I could still (mostly) follow along even in the areas where I knew little to nothing about.This is somewhat similar to Bill Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything but with less emphasis on human accomplishments. Like Bryson, Neil deGrasse Tyson provides great analogies when he explains the creation (and subsequent formation) of the universe. If we combine both books, it feels like we get a Short History of Everything.However...he does waste page space needling his audience about religion, which I could've definitely done without in such a compact book. (It felt rather distasteful).I really liked how Tyson could break down complex topics.
Matter tells space how to curve; space tells matter how to move.
And how he was able to inject humor in such dry matter.
The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.
I would like a sequel called 
Astrophysics for People with Time on their Hands
 - just to see what else is out there!
The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.

3,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I think it's pretty self explanatory what this book is about so no need to summarize. I have to say though that I'm generally not a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, because a lot of times he'll just indulge the actual stupid things other people say. Like the whole ""debate"" about whether or not we're living in a simulation after Elon Musk made that comment. Every time this happens I can't find any actually science news in my newsfeeds because now suddenly everyone is only talking about that one dumb thing. I guess that's not really Neil's fault but I never claimed to be rational. Regardless of my general feelings of irritation whenever I see Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about pop science things I think this books was pretty awesome. It's definitely a short read that manages to be accessible and comprehensive. The only thing I didn't like was the closing chapter, mostly because I'm belligerent and bitter and when people try to be hopeful or just thoughtful the way he was being 99% of the time I'm like god please don't. Still would recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn more about space and doesn't know where to start."

Most people exist in a sphere that is directly impacted by the work of physicists, but only possess a minimal knowledge of some basic Newtonian physics. But even with this gap of knowledge, a few physicists rise to the level of rockstars. Albert Einstein is arguably one of the most recognizable figures of the 20th century. Newton may be one of the most important, and influential, men to have ever lived and exists both in myth and history as a figure almost as important as the founders of major religions (Jesus, Moses, Muhammed). The group of physicists that came to age during the nuclear age also achieved a near rockstar-level reputation and noteriety (Oppenheimer, Fermi, Feynman, etc). In our modern age, a physicist needs to be at one level a genius at math and high-level physics, but also needs to be a great communicator. Neil deGrasse Tyson is almost as much a translator of physics as an astrophysicist in his own right. He bridges that gigantic gulf between the bleeding edge of science and the average person's attention span (not an easy task). He has a talent for understanding his subject, but also getting his audience. He is funny, cheeky, and cognecent that the average reader isn't going to read a 500+ page book on physics (no matter how interesting). So Tyson distills, refines, and delivers just a glimps of what is happening and has happened in the Universe during the last 13.8 Billion years. He does this just as easily in a 140 character tweet as he does in a 208 page book. Some academics are geared toward research and some are geared toward education. Dr. Tyson = Education^3"
6,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has the gift of helping non-geniuses get a slight clue on what those geniuses are talking about. Slight.Don't even think you can sit down and read this baby in a night. It is definitely a read-a-chapter/think-for-a-bit kind of book. I read a chapter after each fiction book I was reading, and then I would talk about it with my genius son who somehow understands all this stuff. I homeschooled the kid. How does he know so much more than I do? I think he might have been cheating on me!! He was out learning shit on the side! Little bastard!Anyway, like all geniuses, Neil deGrasse Tyson can only dumb stuff down so much, so there are quite a bit of mathmatical and scientific terms in the book that he assumes we can understand. Those geniuses don't get just how dumb we are. See? I know something he doesn't. People are morons. Myself included.Damn! Because pictures really would have helped.Still, I really enjoyed getting less dumberer from reading this. I'm going to read more by NDT and hopefully find something my son doesn't know and rub it in his smug little face. Ha! That'll teach him!"

8,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8836060-michelle,3,"Astrophysics is a complex subject. Even years of study barely scratches at the understanding of the universe. Nevertheless, Neil deGrasse Tyson has an amazing ability to make the cosmos fun and understandable. Filled with wonderful ideas -- galaxies devouring dwarf galaxies, massive radio telescopes, a fun run through the periodic table of elements, comets, a study of time --so much is packed into just over 200 pages! Tyson can make the heavy subject engaging, and the strange and ominous fantastically enthralling. I just wish he would leave his political and social agenda out of his scientific presentation. I loved the facts he is an expert with, but I could do without the politics and social theory about which, in my opinion, he has no special knowledge to share. Let's just focus on the matter and energy, please! Tyson is brilliant, but some things in this world are truly subjective.That said, if you don’t mind the author’s platitudes, “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry” is a wonder. It helps you understand a bit of the immensity of space in which we reside, and the extraordinary discoveries we have made in the course of trying to make sense of it all. All the more amazing since some of these discoveries took place over 300 years ago. For some, this may not be the best gateway book if you’re trying to have a better grasp on Astrophysics, but I think this is a lovely addendum for folks that have watched Tyson’s ""Cosmos"" TV series."
9,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,4,"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is a very readable account of the creation of the universe and how the universe works, as related by Neil deGrasse Tyson.I had this on my watch list for a long time but didn't pull the trigger until it went on sale for $1.99.Since the first movie I saw in the theater was a rerelease of Star Wars sometime in the early 80s, space has always given me a sense of wonder. Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is an easily digestible summation of the universe, from the big bang to the present.Neil deGrasse Tyson breaks down the universe into manageable chunks, from leptons to galaxies. He does a good job with theoretical concepts like dark matter and dark energy, pulsars, quasars, and other flashing bits. Since I've watched many of his appearances, it was easy to hear his voice in my head. There's a fair amount of humor but not enough to distract from all the sciencing going on.Seriously, it's a pop science book about the universe. How much else can I say? If you already know a lot about astrophysics, it's probably not the book for you. However, if all you know about the formation of the universe is dimly remembered things from grade school, you'll probably enjoy it. Since most of my recent scientific knowlege comes from Doctor Who episodes, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Four out of five stars."
10,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,4,"This book, as its author, is difficult to rate. I am always happy to see ""normal"" people like me interested in sciences instead of not caring or just accepting what they are told instead of questioning and discovering for themselves. Naturally, we can't all be scientists of the first grade, having deep knowledge of every aspect of the natural world (or technology or whatever). However, curiosity only killed the proverbial cat - in reality, it's vital and good.Many people feel clubbed to death, however, when you start conversations about black holes and the theory of relativity, which is not too hard to understand. It's the problem with many teachers, professors, and other lecturers: they lack the charisma to hold people's attention. What is more, if you can't explain something in layman's terms, don't bother.NDT is one of those rare people, who do not only know what they are talking about (more about that further down), but also have a very unique way of HOW he explains phenomena. Some people even call him a rock star of science. And that is where the problems begin.Many people are of the opinion that we should leave science to the experts, much like the Vatican wants us to leave faith to the priests/cardinals/popes and just blindly accept what they put in front of us and that people like NDT are counterproductive by ""dumbing"" complex matters down (funnily enough, the people complaining are NOT scientists themselves). I, as you probably have guessed, disagree.Yes, compromises have to be made when explaining highly complex matters like the beginning of the universe (as much as we know about it at least) to people without any science degree. Nevertheless, the easy way is not always the right way (yes, I just quoted Dumbledore in a review about a science book but I think NDT would approve). As long as people are interested and learn, we - as a society - can only gain from that. Many discoveries have not necessarily been made by people who already had big names or held titles in their respective fields. And even if it only serves to make someone infect their children with a natural thirst for knowledge, it's worth it (when I look around day after day, I see enough people who enjoy sticking their heads in the sand because it's easier to let others do the work for them).Admittedly, even I (very interested in all sciences and reading a lot about different fields) only know half-truths because some things are too difficult to understand by simply reading about them. But knowing half is better than not knowing at all. Especially since it results in me constantly wanting to learn more.So to all people criticizing NDT and people like him, I say this: keep in mind that the guy is a graduate from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science, then went and got a BA in physics from Harvard and a PhD in astrophysics from Columbia, before being with the American Museum of Natural History (NYC) and serving as their Director of the Hayden Planetarium. He knows what he's talking about.The fact that he's a funny guy who can break down the most complex things into an interesting narrative is an added bonus!This book then is his introduction to the topic of astrophysics. In my opinion, even young teenagers can read it. Make no mistake, it's not even scratching the surface, but only tickling it. However (and this is vitally important), it does so in a way that makes you get hundreds of books of secondary literature and really start digging into the respective topics discussed in the 12 chapters of this book. And THAT is how you catch 'em and reel them in! Really, it's a stroke of genius if you think about it. :DNDT plays his cards right. He knows he's charismatic and he knows that people like listening to him because he makes them laugh in an intelligent way. Just look at this photo from the cover:Yep, playing the rock star card. Big-time. But so what?! He's playing to his strengths and we're all benefitting from it!I've seen a few interviews with him, my favourite being when he dismantles someone who verbally attacks him (idiot) about GMOs. Bwahahahahaha! This man's mind is as sharp as a whip and as far as I can tell from what I've seen/listened to/read from him (I'm following his podcast too), he's never been wrong with what he told people. So yeah, I'll read more about the topics in this book and I'll read more of NDT's books. Sometimes it takes a rock star to make you care about the sincere topics."
11,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26424937-lori,5,"I believe, and I'm sure many of you agree, that every book has its time. This one's been sitting on my bookshelf since I pre-ordered it. I'm glad I didn't get to it because where better to look than up right now to be uplifted and inspired. Just in our little Milky Way, there are at least a hundred billion suns, probably hundreds of billions and just as many planets with their moons. Planet Earth is just a tiny, insignificant part of a single solar system in a single galaxy. In our universe there are trillions of galaxies and this universe may be a small part of a multiverse. Knowing this doesn't make one's problems go away or the world's, but it's a beautiful direction in which to point your mind. It's entirely possible all of us are made from material that originated on Mars. Neil says he stopped counting moons in our solar system at seventy-nine. As I write it's known that there are at least two hundred moons, and asteroids and comets and a certainty that there are more living things than the ones on Earth. it's humbling, he says. It's also intensely fascinating. Reading this book reminded me of things I'd forgotten and taught me a lot of new things. It had me wrestling with chemistry and physics which generally go over my head -- but it had me wrestling. He never lost me and I never gave up trying to understand parts that were hard for me to comprehend. As he showed in the two seasons of Seth MacFarlane's ""Cosmos,"" Neil is the one you want as your guide to the basics of astronomy which among all the sciences has the most to discover. How exciting! Reading this been an educational, enchanting and uplifting experience. Yesterday a paper was published detailing the discovery of an unprecedented collision of two massive black holes -- which happened 1.3 billion years ago. We are just seeing the light from that collision now. Better and different sorts of telescopes are being developed, other ways to make discoveries involving math and physics and chemistry and -- so much being learned now, in our time, and in our future. How exciting! Thanks to Neil's gift for writing and explaining, his patience and his wit, ""Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"" is full of wonders and it's wonderful."

Neil deGrasse Tyson’s book is a joy. Do you need to have some basic grounding in physics to understand and appreciate it? Yes. If you have some basic grounding in physics, will you still be totally overwhelmed and perplexed by some of the ideas it presents? I certainly hope so, or else I’m an idiot (which is entirely possible…okay, probable). But, Tyson has a gift for making the impossibly complex digestible, and this brief overview of some of the most fascinating topics in astrophysics (not dissimilar, though slightly more reader friendly, than Rovelli's Seven Brief Lessons on Physics) is not only enlightening and entertaining, it also provides ample food for thought and a much-needed reason to reflect on things that transcend the day-to-day insanity we call life these days. It’s difficult to grasp the overwhelming size of space when you struggle to figure out how to properly fold a pizza box (as some of us do—shut up), but it’s intellectually rewarding to wrestle with concepts that challenge your brain and force you to think in a different way.Highly recommended for people who want a better grasp of a fascinating scientific arena and who want to sound smart in 30-second soundbites at parties (though be warned that follow-up questions will leave you doing the verbal equivalent of fumbling with a pizza box).

13,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31294609-ivan,5,Short and sweet introduction to astrophysics. Science was bit basic for me as I posses some knowledge of the subject but it's perfect gift for my nephew who has shown interest and keeps asking me to explain this stuff to him. Neil deGrasse Tyson is great with words and simple explanations of complicated things. His writing style is fun and even funny at times and makes all of this sound incredibly cool. That in combination with very short length makes this book perfect if you are trying to set child onto the righteous path of nerd or trying to convert an adult.Also I plan to get it as hardcopy for my nephew but I listened to audiobook version and Tyson's narration is just marvelous.

My interests always veer towards understanding people and the world around me, less than wondering about our beginnings or the scope of the cosmos. As much as I want to learn, all the theoreticals tend to bore me. But, this book does a really great job of presenting the material from a grounded, real-world approach. Tyson uses funny anecdotes (my favorite is the one about whipped cream and gravity) to help explain these strange, difficult concepts, and it's overall very well done. Plus that chapter on Dark Matter? Spooky and all types of interesting.At the end of the day, I can't rate this any-higher, because I still zoned out more often than I want to admit. But, I was less confused than I thought I'd be, and more interested than I thought I'd be, so that's something? "
15,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,3," 3.5 starsNeil DeGrasse TysonNeil DeGrasse Tyson, an American astrophysicist, is the Director of the Hayden Planetarium, and the host of 'Star Talk' and 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.' Tyson is also a very funny guy, and his sense of humor lightens the 'lessons' in Astrophysics for People in a Hurry - which contains a brief overview of cosmology.I'll just touch on some topics in the book I found interesting.....some new, some not so much.******Fourteen billion years ago the universe was teeny tiny, 'a trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.' It exploded in 'The Big Bang' and expanded at a phenomenal rate - one second after the big bang the universe was already several light years across (at least 18 trillion miles). The Big BangBy then, the forces we're familiar with had formed: gravity, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force. At the same time, a large array of particles had appeared, including photons, electrons, neutrinos, quarks, and more....all the stuff that makes up 'matter.' For the first billion years the universe continued to expand and cool, and matter coalesced into galaxies. Scientists estimate that there are about 100 billion galaxies, each containing hundreds of billions of stars. Debris around some stars merged to form planets, and Earth formed in a 'Goldilocks' zone where oceans remain liquid.....allowing life as we know it to develop.Matter coalesced into galaxies*****Sir Isaac NewtonAfter Sir Isaac Newton determined the laws of gravity, scientists discovered that physical forces are uniform throughout the universe. Tyson notes, ""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."" The astrophysicist has a fun story about this: When Tyson told a waiter that his hot cocoa had no whipped cream, the server insisted it had sunk to the bottom. But whipped cream has low density, and floats. So Tyson gave the waiter two options: ""Either someone forgot to add whipped cream or the universal laws of physics are different in this restaurant."" LOL Cosmic background radiation (CMB), seen in every direction we look, is the microwave radiation emitted by the cooling universe 380,000 years after the big bang. It's the remnant of something that was once enormously bright, but now requires special instruments to observe.CMB was first seen by two American physicists that worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories. They accidentally discovered CMB while trying to develop new channels of communication for AT&T.....and later won the Nobel Prize for this achievement (so that's a nice perk!). *****Ordinary matter makes up everything we see and feel. It has gravity and interacts with light. However, this ordinary stuff makes up only 15 to 20 percent of the universe. A full 80 to 85 percent of the cosmos is made of a mysterious substance called 'dark matter', which has gravity but doesn't interact with light. Scientists have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what this is. As if dark matter isn't sufficiently enigmatic, the universe also contains a large amount of 'dark energy.' This is a kind of 'negative gravity' that's pushing the universe apart - accelerating its expansion. As a result, anything not gravitationally connected to the Milky Way Galaxy (where we live) will rush away at an ever increasing speed. So galaxies that are now visible to our telescopes will eventually disappear from view. Tyson notes, ""In a trillion years, anyone alive in the Milky Way may know nothing of other galaxies, and will see nothing but a dark, endless void."" :(*****William and Caroline HerschelIn 1781, British astronomer William Herschel discovered a new planet in our solar system. He wanted to name it after his King, in which case the planets would be called: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and George. More traditional heads prevailed, and planet was named Uranus. :)*****To communicate with life elsewhere in the universe - who probably wouldn't understand our spoken languages (just watch the 2016 movie 'Arrival') - we would have to use the language of science. The Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, carries a plaque that shows humans, our solar system, our location in the Milky Way Galaxy, and the structure of hydrogen and the atom.Voyager Plaque It also carries a gold record album that has whale sounds, and music from Beethoven, Chuck Berry, and others. Tyson mentions that his favorite parody of this 'gift' is an old skit on Saturday Night Live, in which we receive a written reply from the aliens that asks ""Send more Chuck Berry."" Ha ha haVoyager Record******Tyson's book has lots more interesting information about the universe - and how we study it. On the (slight) downside - since the book is based on a series of essays - it's a little repetitive. And there's a section on elements that veers off the topic of astrophysics.I'd highly recommend this 'astrophysics light' book to non-specialists interested in the subject. (If you're a physicist, you presumably know all this already.) In this life I've studied tons of biology and geology. In my next life I'd like to be an astrophysicist who solves the mystery of dark matter and dark energy. :)You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."

The library was backed up so I know I wasn't the only one. I truly love the way he teaches the reader science on the reader's level without talking down to us. So many fun, witty remarks that stick the info in your head helps. He makes science fun! No wonder the kids these days know him, besides the fact he 'killed Pluto'. LOL. Wonderful book and I learned and laughed."
17,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1880531-carol-bookaria,3,"I had different expectations about this book, and the problem is likely me and not the book. The book explains astrophysics, or what we know to date about this subject from the beginning (the Big Bang) to today and also the possible future. Everything is explained theoretically and clarified as that.I love reading about science facts and that's what I expected but the subject is astrophysics which is defined as: ""the branch of astronomy concerned with the physical nature of stars and other celestial bodies, and the application of the laws and theories of physics to the interpretation of astronomical observations."" (source)So clearly I didn't have an idea of what I was getting into. However, the definition of astrophysics was clarified while reading this book. Neil deGrasse Tyson does an excellent job of explaining these complex ideas and putting it in simple, understandable terms. A lot of the concepts went over my head and require abstract thinking from the part of the reader. I listened to the audiobook which is narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, he did a wonderful job at that. Overall I liked it but did not love it. I recommend it to all those interested in the cosmos, astrophysics, dark matter and other theoretical subjects. Review posted on blog.FINAL NOTE: The author is very charismatic and if you follow him on twitter you probably have realized this by now. His tweets are poignant, interesting and funny."

I didn't watch Cosmos, for instance. But I like astrophysics, the parts I can grasp, and have an admiration for people who can grasp the science and math and concepts enough to push our understanding forward.This is a short book, and I will recommend the audio read by the author. He is very passionate and exuberant about his topics, and it still came across a bit sped up (which I felt it needed.) The different chapters are sometimes previous essays, compiled into this layman's overview of astrophysics - intentionally short, concepts boiled down to the core of where our understanding started, what we know now, and what we do not know. It's clear that the one thing we really have gained understanding of is all that we do not know!I was least thrilled by the periodical table chapter, but I get it, the elements are not unique to earth, and that can be used as evidence for some things, mostly things I'm not super interested in the debate on. But I loved his cosmic perspective and where humanity fits as much as I loved his visual description of what the galaxies looked like in the past, and his questions about the things that we can never know we don't know because they are gone. This is the best science book I've read all year, and possibly also the only science book I will have read this year. "

Osmosis or something.I listen to his podcast, StarTalk sometimes, and that one is a bit easier to follow. Okay, a lot easier.What did I take away? Oh, who am I kidding?

21,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most remarkable scientists of our time, having devoted a large part of his work to popularise his field of study, astrophysics, sometimes one of the most counterintuitive sciences of all. I loved his “remake” of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos TV show, and this book is in the same vein. As announced in the title, it’s a slim pop-science book that can be read in one sitting. It covers a wide field nonetheless: from the Big Bang to black holes and multiverses, to the chemistry of the universe, to life evolution, to exoplanets, to astronomical observatories. Tyson has a knack for making everything quite accessible and even fun to the layperson. He also is an expert in the history of physics and, while covering contemporary subjects (one of his favourites being dark matter and dark energy), he manages to drop a few facts about Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday or Albert Einstein.I remember reading other books written by astrophysicists, like Carl Sagan’s Cosmos, Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time, Trinh Xuan Thuan’s The Secret Melody or Hubert Reeves’ Patience dans l'azur. Somehow, in each case, and probably unbeknownst to their authors, these books have a distinctive poetic flavour, a sort of lyrical flight, which is best expressed in this sentence by the Scottish astronomer James Ferguson, quoted at the end of Tyson’s book:
Of all the sciences cultivated by mankind, Astronomy is acknowledged to be, and undoubtedly is, the most sublime, the most interesting, and the most useful. For, by knowledge derived from this science, not only the bulk of the Earth is discovered . . .; but our very faculties are enlarged with the grandeur of the ideas it conveys, our minds exalted above [their] low contracted prejudices.

22,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is cool. No question. He doesn't pack much into this short book, but whatever he does talk about is always cool. Even too cool sometimes. Sagan used to awe us with this stuff, but deGrasse Tyson makes it easy to feel like a nerd, by oversimplifying concepts and letting some of his smooth arrogance pass onto the reader.But, there are always enough nuggets to keep your true inner nerd interested: Like when he explains how Quarks have fractional charges that come in thirds, and that the force that keeps two or more of them together actually grows stronger the more you separate them... Wow, right? And the whole discussion on dark energy and dark matter is the coolest bit, because Tyson is at his best in dealing with still unexplored bits of the subject.All in all, Tyson's geeky, aloof, arrogant voice remains consistent through this book as well - and those of us who derive pleasure from a likeable know-it-all like Tyson talking down to know-nothings, will enjoy every bit of it. Especially, when the arrogance arising from the backing of science and its capabilities are laced with just the right dose of Sagan-like, pale-blue-dot-like humility about how the arrow of knowledge always gives us humans a smaller and smaller role in the universe."

I stopped enjoying science in school when numbers got involved, somewhere around Honors Chemistry. This book was perfect for me. Written in an engaging, approachable style, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry has reignited my interest in science, particularly in astronomy. I learned a lot, only by rereading passages several times and then putting the book down to think for a few minutes before continuing, but mostly I came away with a sense of amazement and humility in the face of the universe and the people so much smarter than me that study it.The last thirty pages were so profound, just so shockingly profound and inspiring, that I actually feel differently about the world and my place in it. And now I’m off to watch Cosmos and probably order another NDT book to read once my brain recovers from this one."

I will accept all the blame for my totally honest take on this book: I hated it. My biggest takeaway was that I’m not interested in astrophysics at all...and I’m okay with that!"

I found that turning the television on in the bedroom with the volume on low works well to quiet my insanely hyperactive mind, especially if the voices are soothing and calming. Some of my favorites: any of those documentary shows that deal with oceans and animals and such, the shows about our vast universe, and Bob Ross. The voices are super quiet and there are no drastic/sudden increases in volume to shock me out of my almost sleep. While flipping through the YouTube app on my TV last night to find something, I came across the audiobook version of this that had been posted. (Hint hint the audiobook is free on YouTube hint hint). I read the book in 2017 so I didn’t necessarily need to read it again, but I know that Neil’s voice was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, I had the volume a little too high and got interested again in how well he explains mind-blowing science. Do I understand it all? Heck no. But that wasn’t the intention of the book. The intention was sort of to make me understand that I didn’t understand anything, that the universe is so much more complicated than anyone can understand in a 3.5 hour audiobook reading. It helps me understand what some very intelligent people are doing to figure out some things that even they don’t know yet. 3.5 hours later, I was still awake but much more at peace. And sleep finally came. 6/6/2017 Original Review - Sadly, this is just more proof that the universe doesn't revolve around me. I highly recommend the audiobook, read by Neil himself. His voice is soothing, and the astrophysics seem somehow easier to understand coming directly from him."

I will never become an astrophysicist but Neil deGrasse Tyson is so comfortable in his chosen speciality that he makes this audio version very pleasant to listen to. He is able to tell jokes about astrophysics and calls gravity Big G. I don't think I would have enjoyed reading this as much as listening to it. He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."
33,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8542123-meags,3,"3 StarsConsidering this is essentially a science book for beginners, it’s probably not a good thing that literally everything discussed here went over my head. Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."

Though it was a good refresher and in a few areas useful. Eg I knew about dark matter but not dark energy. There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

It is well written, but could perhaps have been dumbed down even a little more for us non-astrophysicists (not sure you could dumb it down more than it was, though - it did well to reaffirm that the decision I made in university to leave the science department was the right decision lol). Tyson sure knows how to make science sound sexy, that's for sure. Decent little read, glad I read it and learned a thing or two.

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it. Science for the win!!Note: The audiobook version is narrated by the author Neil deGrasse Tyson.My favorite quote:“The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”"

Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence. Overall, a good book, but there are better ones out there on the subject. "

You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved.

There is a helpful index at the end if the book you can use to look up things you may be curious about. Something tells me he did t expect people to read it in one sitting. I think that if the book included pictures that would have helped break things up. I can't complain too much though since it was such a short read.

42,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

45,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,4,"Astronomy has always enthralled me and I was completely captivated by Carl Sagan ages ago, Now I’m equally captivated by Neil deGrasse Tyson and his warm lively voice - the way his deep passion for our universe and the forces and elements in it tie us all together. I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel.

Of course that it was authored by Neil deGrasse Tyson was a plus. "
47,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Tyson's opening salvo here knocked me tail over teakettle. Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

49,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book is a compilation of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s essays on popular science for Natural History magazine. The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand. The author even throws in a bit of wit and humor to keep it fun. "
50,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie,5,"At my age - almost old enough to be a great-grandmother but young enough to be happy that I'm not - I won't pretend to be in a hurry to do much of anything. But ever since I was a farm kid watching a star-filled sky on a blanket in our back yard, I've wanted to know more about how it all came about. Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
54,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
55,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."

I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."

Though it was a good refresher and in a few areas useful. Eg I knew about dark matter but not dark energy. There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

It is well written, but could perhaps have been dumbed down even a little more for us non-astrophysicists (not sure you could dumb it down more than it was, though - it did well to reaffirm that the decision I made in university to leave the science department was the right decision lol). Tyson sure knows how to make science sound sexy, that's for sure. Decent little read, glad I read it and learned a thing or two.

""Who gets to celebrate this cosmic view of life? Not the migrant farm-worker. Not the sweatshop worker. Certainly not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food. You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated...""""Yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost…sometimes I lose sight of Earth. When I pause and reflect on our expanding universe, with its galaxies hurtling away from one another, embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time, sometimes I forget that uncounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter, and that children are disproportionately represented among them.When I pore over the data that establish the mysterious presence of dark matter and dark energy throughout the universe, sometimes I forget that every day—every twenty-four-hour rotation of Earth —people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s conception of God, and that some people who do not kill in the name of God, kill in the name of needs or wants of political dogma.When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being.And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.During our brief stay on planet Earth, we owe ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore—in part because it’s fun to do. But there’s a far nobler reason. The day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that the universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their “low contracted prejudices.” And that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment—until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace, rather than fear, the cosmic perspective.""

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it. Science for the win!!Note: The audiobook version is narrated by the author Neil deGrasse Tyson.My favorite quote:“The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”"

Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence.

You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved.

72,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel.

Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

79,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book is a compilation of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s essays on popular science for Natural History magazine. The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand. The author even throws in a bit of wit and humor to keep it fun. "
80,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie,5,"At my age - almost old enough to be a great-grandmother but young enough to be happy that I'm not - I won't pretend to be in a hurry to do much of anything. But ever since I was a farm kid watching a star-filled sky on a blanket in our back yard, I've wanted to know more about how it all came about. Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
84,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
85,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."

I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."

There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it.

Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence.

You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved.

102,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

105,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,4,"Astronomy has always enthralled me and I was completely captivated by Carl Sagan ages ago, Now I’m equally captivated by Neil deGrasse Tyson and his warm lively voice - the way his deep passion for our universe and the forces and elements in it tie us all together. I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel. The fact that an imploding star galaxies away can brighten our skies gives the power of light a whole new meaning. "
106,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"It is beyond my abilities to try and review this book and its contents , suffice it to say that I did find it interesting and a very good introduction to a complex subject such as astrophysics. Of course that it was authored by Neil deGrasse Tyson was a plus. "
107,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Tyson's opening salvo here knocked me tail over teakettle. Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

109,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book is a compilation of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s essays on popular science for Natural History magazine. The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand. The author even throws in a bit of wit and humor to keep it fun. "
110,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie,5,"At my age - almost old enough to be a great-grandmother but young enough to be happy that I'm not - I won't pretend to be in a hurry to do much of anything. But ever since I was a farm kid watching a star-filled sky on a blanket in our back yard, I've wanted to know more about how it all came about. Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
114,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
115,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."
116,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,4,"I am fascinated by the discoveries in astrophysics and enjoy the success of Neil deGrasse Tyson in bringing its wonders to popular culture. I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

This book is full of mind blowing speeds and distances and timescales and sizes. Tours of the periodic table and of the solar system's moons.

I will never become an astrophysicist but Neil deGrasse Tyson is so comfortable in his chosen speciality that he makes this audio version very pleasant to listen to. He is able to tell jokes about astrophysics and calls gravity Big G. I don't think I would have enjoyed reading this as much as listening to it. He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."
124,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,3,"Not really designed for someone who took physics in college. If you have no base of physics this might be good. Though it was a good refresher and in a few areas useful. Eg I knew about dark matter but not dark energy. There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

It is well written, but could perhaps have been dumbed down even a little more for us non-astrophysicists (not sure you could dumb it down more than it was, though - it did well to reaffirm that the decision I made in university to leave the science department was the right decision lol). Tyson sure knows how to make science sound sexy, that's for sure. Decent little read, glad I read it and learned a thing or two.

""Who gets to celebrate this cosmic view of life? Not the migrant farm-worker. Not the sweatshop worker. Certainly not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food. You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated...""""Yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost…sometimes I lose sight of Earth. When I pause and reflect on our expanding universe, with its galaxies hurtling away from one another, embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time, sometimes I forget that uncounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter, and that children are disproportionately represented among them.When I pore over the data that establish the mysterious presence of dark matter and dark energy throughout the universe, sometimes I forget that every day—every twenty-four-hour rotation of Earth —people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s conception of God, and that some people who do not kill in the name of God, kill in the name of needs or wants of political dogma.When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being.And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.During our brief stay on planet Earth, we owe ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore—in part because it’s fun to do. But there’s a far nobler reason. The day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that the universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their “low contracted prejudices.” And that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment—until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace, rather than fear, the cosmic perspective.""

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it. Science for the win!!Note: The audiobook version is narrated by the author Neil deGrasse Tyson.My favorite quote:“The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”"
130,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3,"I'm a Neil deGrasse Tyson fan, but this simply didn't come close to touching the well-organized and pretty brilliant A Short History of Nearly Everything, which I listened to at more or less the same time. The beginning was the biggest struggle for me, but I'll admit that it improved a great deal towards the end. Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence. Overall, a good book, but there are better ones out there on the subject. "
131,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian,4,"I did enjoy this but don't know what else to say about it. My background is not science, but I definitely enjoyed reading the author's comments about astrophysics. And I did get sad a fee times he brings up people arguing against science and instead only wanting to believe everything in the Bible. Mr. deGrasse Tyson takes us point by point through astrophysics. You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved. ""We do not simply live in this universe. The universe lives within us.""""When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being. And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.""At some key points deGrasse Tyson's humor shines through and I wish he had let more of it come through this book. There is a helpful index at the end if the book you can use to look up things you may be curious about. Something tells me he did t expect people to read it in one sitting. I think that if the book included pictures that would have helped break things up. I can't complain too much though since it was such a short read. I wish I had just borrowed this from the library since I completed it at around 78 percent though. "
132,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

Curious little read, but not as spellbinding as I anticipated. I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson set my expectation barrier way too high by now. I was expected to be blown away. I wasn't but still... I was intellectually entertained:)This book is very similar in style to Seven Brief Lessons on Physics but I somewhat enjoyed Rovelli's delivery a bit better. Greatly recommended as a long-haul flight companion"

135,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,4,"Astronomy has always enthralled me and I was completely captivated by Carl Sagan ages ago, Now I’m equally captivated by Neil deGrasse Tyson and his warm lively voice - the way his deep passion for our universe and the forces and elements in it tie us all together. I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel. The fact that an imploding star galaxies away can brighten our skies gives the power of light a whole new meaning. "
136,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"It is beyond my abilities to try and review this book and its contents , suffice it to say that I did find it interesting and a very good introduction to a complex subject such as astrophysics. Of course that it was authored by Neil deGrasse Tyson was a plus. "
137,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Tyson's opening salvo here knocked me tail over teakettle. Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

139,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book is a compilation of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s essays on popular science for Natural History magazine. The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand.

But ever since I was a farm kid watching a star-filled sky on a blanket in our back yard, I've wanted to know more about how it all came about. Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
144,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
145,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."

I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."
154,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,3,"Not really designed for someone who took physics in college. If you have no base of physics this might be good. Though it was a good refresher and in a few areas useful. Eg I knew about dark matter but not dark energy. There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

It is well written, but could perhaps have been dumbed down even a little more for us non-astrophysicists (not sure you could dumb it down more than it was, though - it did well to reaffirm that the decision I made in university to leave the science department was the right decision lol). Tyson sure knows how to make science sound sexy, that's for sure. Decent little read, glad I read it and learned a thing or two.

""Who gets to celebrate this cosmic view of life? Not the migrant farm-worker. Not the sweatshop worker. Certainly not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food. You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated...""""Yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost…sometimes I lose sight of Earth. When I pause and reflect on our expanding universe, with its galaxies hurtling away from one another, embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time, sometimes I forget that uncounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter, and that children are disproportionately represented among them.When I pore over the data that establish the mysterious presence of dark matter and dark energy throughout the universe, sometimes I forget that every day—every twenty-four-hour rotation of Earth —people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s conception of God, and that some people who do not kill in the name of God, kill in the name of needs or wants of political dogma.When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being.And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.During our brief stay on planet Earth, we owe ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore—in part because it’s fun to do. But there’s a far nobler reason. The day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that the universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their “low contracted prejudices.” And that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment—until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace, rather than fear, the cosmic perspective.""

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it. Science for the win!!Note: The audiobook version is narrated by the author Neil deGrasse Tyson.My favorite quote:“The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”"

The beginning was the biggest struggle for me, but I'll admit that it improved a great deal towards the end. Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence. Overall, a good book, but there are better ones out there on the subject. "
161,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian,4,"I did enjoy this but don't know what else to say about it. My background is not science, but I definitely enjoyed reading the author's comments about astrophysics. And I did get sad a fee times he brings up people arguing against science and instead only wanting to believe everything in the Bible. Mr. deGrasse Tyson takes us point by point through astrophysics. You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved. ""We do not simply live in this universe. The universe lives within us.""""When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being. And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.""At some key points deGrasse Tyson's humor shines through and I wish he had let more of it come through this book. There is a helpful index at the end if the book you can use to look up things you may be curious about. Something tells me he did t expect people to read it in one sitting. I think that if the book included pictures that would have helped break things up. I can't complain too much though since it was such a short read. I wish I had just borrowed this from the library since I completed it at around 78 percent though. "
162,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

Curious little read, but not as spellbinding as I anticipated. I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson set my expectation barrier way too high by now. I was expected to be blown away. I wasn't but still... I was intellectually entertained:)This book is very similar in style to Seven Brief Lessons on Physics but I somewhat enjoyed Rovelli's delivery a bit better. Greatly recommended as a long-haul flight companion"

165,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,4,"Astronomy has always enthralled me and I was completely captivated by Carl Sagan ages ago, Now I’m equally captivated by Neil deGrasse Tyson and his warm lively voice - the way his deep passion for our universe and the forces and elements in it tie us all together. I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel. The fact that an imploding star galaxies away can brighten our skies gives the power of light a whole new meaning. "
166,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"It is beyond my abilities to try and review this book and its contents , suffice it to say that I did find it interesting and a very good introduction to a complex subject such as astrophysics. Of course that it was authored by Neil deGrasse Tyson was a plus. "
167,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Tyson's opening salvo here knocked me tail over teakettle. Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

169,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book is a compilation of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s essays on popular science for Natural History magazine. The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand.

But ever since I was a farm kid watching a star-filled sky on a blanket in our back yard, I've wanted to know more about how it all came about. Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
174,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
175,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."

I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

I will never become an astrophysicist but Neil deGrasse Tyson is so comfortable in his chosen speciality that he makes this audio version very pleasant to listen to.

He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

182,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094570-katharine-ventureadlaxre,5,"This is everything it says on the tin. As a bit of background - I haven't yet read any of Tyson's other books. My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."
183,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8542123-meags,3,"3 StarsConsidering this is essentially a science book for beginners, it’s probably not a good thing that literally everything discussed here went over my head. Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."
184,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,3,"Not really designed for someone who took physics in college. If you have no base of physics this might be good. Though it was a good refresher and in a few areas useful. Eg I knew about dark matter but not dark energy. There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "
185,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24154009-jason,3,"This book does something very well - it puts everything into perspective. This really is a reminder to some people that the universe doesn't revolve around them, and if I could recommend this book to anybody, it might be a politician or two...cough cough.No major criticisms. It is well written, but could perhaps have been dumbed down even a little more for us non-astrophysicists (not sure you could dumb it down more than it was, though - it did well to reaffirm that the decision I made in university to leave the science department was the right decision lol). Tyson sure knows how to make science sound sexy, that's for sure. Decent little read, glad I read it and learned a thing or two. There are some really fun facts in here, ones you can throw in your friends' faces and sound really smart. "

""Who gets to celebrate this cosmic view of life? Not the migrant farm-worker. Not the sweatshop worker. Certainly not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food. You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated...""""Yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost…sometimes I lose sight of Earth. When I pause and reflect on our expanding universe, with its galaxies hurtling away from one another, embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time, sometimes I forget that uncounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter, and that children are disproportionately represented among them.When I pore over the data that establish the mysterious presence of dark matter and dark energy throughout the universe, sometimes I forget that every day—every twenty-four-hour rotation of Earth —people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s conception of God, and that some people who do not kill in the name of God, kill in the name of needs or wants of political dogma.When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being.And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.During our brief stay on planet Earth, we owe ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore—in part because it’s fun to do. But there’s a far nobler reason. The day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that the universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their “low contracted prejudices.” And that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment—until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace, rather than fear, the cosmic perspective.""

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it. Science for the win!!Note: The audiobook version is narrated by the author Neil deGrasse Tyson.My favorite quote:“The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”"

The beginning was the biggest struggle for me, but I'll admit that it improved a great deal towards the end. Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence. Overall, a good book, but there are better ones out there on the subject. "
191,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian,4,"I did enjoy this but don't know what else to say about it. My background is not science, but I definitely enjoyed reading the author's comments about astrophysics. And I did get sad a fee times he brings up people arguing against science and instead only wanting to believe everything in the Bible. Mr. deGrasse Tyson takes us point by point through astrophysics. You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved. ""We do not simply live in this universe. The universe lives within us.""""When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being. And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.""At some key points deGrasse Tyson's humor shines through and I wish he had let more of it come through this book. There is a helpful index at the end if the book you can use to look up things you may be curious about. Something tells me he did t expect people to read it in one sitting. I think that if the book included pictures that would have helped break things up. I can't complain too much though since it was such a short read. I wish I had just borrowed this from the library since I completed it at around 78 percent though. "
192,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

Curious little read, but not as spellbinding as I anticipated. I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson set my expectation barrier way too high by now. I was expected to be blown away. I wasn't but still... I was intellectually entertained:)This book is very similar in style to Seven Brief Lessons on Physics but I somewhat enjoyed Rovelli's delivery a bit better. Greatly recommended as a long-haul flight companion"

195,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,4,"Astronomy has always enthralled me and I was completely captivated by Carl Sagan ages ago, Now I’m equally captivated by Neil deGrasse Tyson and his warm lively voice - the way his deep passion for our universe and the forces and elements in it tie us all together. I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel. The fact that an imploding star galaxies away can brighten our skies gives the power of light a whole new meaning. "
196,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"It is beyond my abilities to try and review this book and its contents , suffice it to say that I did find it interesting and a very good introduction to a complex subject such as astrophysics. Of course that it was authored by Neil deGrasse Tyson was a plus. "
197,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Tyson's opening salvo here knocked me tail over teakettle. Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand.

Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
204,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
205,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."

I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

I will never become an astrophysicist but Neil deGrasse Tyson is so comfortable in his chosen speciality that he makes this audio version very pleasant to listen to. He is able to tell jokes about astrophysics and calls gravity Big G. I don't think I would have enjoyed reading this as much as listening to it. He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."

Though it was a good refresher and in a few areas useful. Eg I knew about dark matter but not dark energy. There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

It is well written, but could perhaps have been dumbed down even a little more for us non-astrophysicists (not sure you could dumb it down more than it was, though - it did well to reaffirm that the decision I made in university to leave the science department was the right decision lol). Tyson sure knows how to make science sound sexy, that's for sure. Decent little read, glad I read it and learned a thing or two.

""Who gets to celebrate this cosmic view of life? Not the migrant farm-worker. Not the sweatshop worker. Certainly not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food. You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated...""""Yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost…sometimes I lose sight of Earth. When I pause and reflect on our expanding universe, with its galaxies hurtling away from one another, embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time, sometimes I forget that uncounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter, and that children are disproportionately represented among them.When I pore over the data that establish the mysterious presence of dark matter and dark energy throughout the universe, sometimes I forget that every day—every twenty-four-hour rotation of Earth —people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s conception of God, and that some people who do not kill in the name of God, kill in the name of needs or wants of political dogma.When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being.And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.During our brief stay on planet Earth, we owe ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore—in part because it’s fun to do. But there’s a far nobler reason. The day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that the universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their “low contracted prejudices.” And that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment—until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace, rather than fear, the cosmic perspective.""

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it. Science for the win!!Note: The audiobook version is narrated by the author Neil deGrasse Tyson.My favorite quote:“The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.”"

The beginning was the biggest struggle for me, but I'll admit that it improved a great deal towards the end. Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence. Overall, a good book, but there are better ones out there on the subject. "

My background is not science, but I definitely enjoyed reading the author's comments about astrophysics. And I did get sad a fee times he brings up people arguing against science and instead only wanting to believe everything in the Bible. Mr. deGrasse Tyson takes us point by point through astrophysics. You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved.

There is a helpful index at the end if the book you can use to look up things you may be curious about. Something tells me he did t expect people to read it in one sitting. I think that if the book included pictures that would have helped break things up. I can't complain too much though since it was such a short read.

222,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

225,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,4,"Astronomy has always enthralled me and I was completely captivated by Carl Sagan ages ago, Now I’m equally captivated by Neil deGrasse Tyson and his warm lively voice - the way his deep passion for our universe and the forces and elements in it tie us all together. I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel. The fact that an imploding star galaxies away can brighten our skies gives the power of light a whole new meaning. "

Of course that it was authored by Neil deGrasse Tyson was a plus. "
227,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Tyson's opening salvo here knocked me tail over teakettle. Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans.

There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
234,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
235,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."

I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."

There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated...""""Yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost…sometimes I lose sight of Earth. When I pause and reflect on our expanding universe, with its galaxies hurtling away from one another, embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time, sometimes I forget that uncounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter, and that children are disproportionately represented among them.When I pore over the data that establish the mysterious presence of dark matter and dark energy throughout the universe, sometimes I forget that every day—every twenty-four-hour rotation of Earth —people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s conception of God, and that some people who do not kill in the name of God, kill in the name of needs or wants of political dogma.When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being.And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.During our brief stay on planet Earth, we owe ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore—in part because it’s fun to do. But there’s a far nobler reason. The day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that the universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their “low contracted prejudices.” And that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment—until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace, rather than fear, the cosmic perspective.""

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it.

252,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel.

257,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Tyson's opening salvo here knocked me tail over teakettle. Every so often I like to have a go at one of the new “cosmos for dummies” books that regularly appear, on the off chance that my intellect will have improved and the wonders of the universe will, finally, come into clear focus for me and things will stick. Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

259,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book is a compilation of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s essays on popular science for Natural History magazine. The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand. The author even throws in a bit of wit and humor to keep it fun. "

But ever since I was a farm kid watching a star-filled sky on a blanket in our back yard, I've wanted to know more about how it all came about. Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
264,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
265,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."

I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

He has a very soothing voice.Even Einstein thought he'd made a mistake but later his mistake was proven not to be a mistake. I have always loved Einstein and the awe which NDT has in his voice when he talks about Einstein is wonderful. He is able to relate his love of what makes up the universe and the laws that have proven time after time to be true, to someone like me. I got to listen to his book with his voice reading it.

My science background is limited to high school science classes that weren't even as advanced as physics/bio/chem, though we did have a few good sessions on forensics... I have a friend who is an astrophysicist and I read some science fiction books... and that's it. So keeping all that in mind - I was able to not only understand this book, but enjoy it. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, from what we already know of his excellent shows and cameos on tv, has a way of spinning massive theories into something you can understand over a cup of tea and half your attention.It is utterly amazing how the universe works - he explains something so utterly cosmic and then says 'a trillionth of a second has passed since the beginning', which is just mind blowing.It's a short book at 140 or so pages, and the chapters are short, which makes it a book you can pick up and put down when you have the mental space to breathe around it and absorb - for me, at least, with my previously mentioned lack of scientific background. Because it's so short it's a little hard to review - though that could also be because it's hard to share the amazing things you learn in this book without basically copy-pasting entire sections. I can say it's fast-paced, well worded, easily accessible, and I highly recommend."

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a cool dude. He’s hella smart - obviously - but he’s also damn engaging and informative, and he never seems to come across as condescending to the lowlier, smaller brained individuals such as myself. I just like the guy, and as such, I was looking forward to seeing if I could grasp some of these big, science-y concepts when put forward by deGrasse Tyson in his interesting and accessible manner. Sadly, everything discussed here went in one ear and out the other. That’s not on him - I clearly just don’t have the mental capacity to grasp these complex concepts, and that’s more than okay. If you are more science-minded then this might be a successful read for you. And I certainly recommend the audio edition, narrated by deGrasse Tyson himself."

Though it was a good refresher and in a few areas useful. Eg I knew about dark matter but not dark energy. There were some fun tidbits too - I found it fascinating that the Moon is 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it's also 1/400th as far away from us, so they look the same size in the sky - a pure coincidence. Can you image how weird it would be otherwise? Another one was how there is a high probability of a killer asteroid hitting earth within the next 100 million years. But that probability would be much larger if we didn't have big brother Jupiter in our system - who is so large that it acts as a shield and bats many asteroids out of harms way. "

It is well written, but could perhaps have been dumbed down even a little more for us non-astrophysicists (not sure you could dumb it down more than it was, though - it did well to reaffirm that the decision I made in university to leave the science department was the right decision lol). Tyson sure knows how to make science sound sexy, that's for sure. Decent little read, glad I read it and learned a thing or two.

You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. You need to live in a nation whose government values the search to understand humanity’s place in the universe. You need a society in which intellectual pursuit can take you to the frontiers of discovery, and in which news of your discoveries can be routinely disseminated...""""Yet the cosmic view comes with a hidden cost…sometimes I lose sight of Earth. When I pause and reflect on our expanding universe, with its galaxies hurtling away from one another, embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time, sometimes I forget that uncounted people walk this Earth without food or shelter, and that children are disproportionately represented among them.When I pore over the data that establish the mysterious presence of dark matter and dark energy throughout the universe, sometimes I forget that every day—every twenty-four-hour rotation of Earth —people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s conception of God, and that some people who do not kill in the name of God, kill in the name of needs or wants of political dogma.When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, sometimes I forget that too many people act in wanton disregard for the delicate interplay of Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, with consequences that our children and our children’s children will witness and pay for with their health and well-being.And sometimes I forget that powerful people rarely do all they can to help those who cannot help themselves.During our brief stay on planet Earth, we owe ourselves and our descendants the opportunity to explore—in part because it’s fun to do. But there’s a far nobler reason. The day our knowledge of the cosmos ceases to expand, we risk regressing to the childish view that the universe figuratively and literally revolves around us. In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their “low contracted prejudices.” And that would be the last gasp of human enlightenment—until the rise of a visionary new culture that could once again embrace, rather than fear, the cosmic perspective.""

“We are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out—and we have only just begun.”

 I truly believe that mankind will never know the depths of space and the why's and how's of it all. I'm not being pessimistic; I believe space is infinite and thus we can never know. And if you ponder on infinity too long you'll likely go clinically insane. This is why I, a science girl, chose a field of study outside of astrophysics. I don't think I could ever be satisfied with that one single drop of knowledge comparatively. However, I still am interested...as are so many others as evidenced by 2017's goodreads choice award votes. Congrats to both the readers who voted and Neil deGrasse Tyson for the recognition. Everyone benefited!Astrophysics for People in a Hurry is just what the title implies. It's a scaled down version of astrophysics that still has enough substance and quality information to plump up our brains. This quick read is good if you want a fairly brief intro into the subject or if you want to see if any of the big, mainstream theories have changed from long ago school days. This book could be considered somewhat dry reading material for anyone who finds they're actually not all that interested in the subject, but it seems many readers have enjoyed it.

Neil deGrasse Tyson has a lovely speaking voice, but for someone who speaks as often and as publicly as he does, I was a little surprised that his narration lacked a little in terms of cadence.

You get to read about Einstein's theory of relatively, gravity, discussions of dark matter, the periodic table of elements, etc. There were definitely some comments here and there that I loved.

282,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,2,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, which made this book all the more disappointing. True to its title, Tyson does discuss astrophysics in a hurry, as the book is comprised of a number of short essays on various topics in the field. However, Tyson writes the book as if his audience is sophomore physics students. He takes virtually no time to explain what things mean. Even as a former physics major, I struggled to understand parts of the book. I am concerned that readers without a background in physics will have very low rates of comprehension, much less retention. I think Tyson's book should have focused less on cutting-edge topics such as dark matter or dark energy, and more on the basics of the field, such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Unless the goal of the book is to give readers small tidbits that can be mentioned at cocktail parties (""Yes, in between my family's ski trips to Aspen, I like to study how dark matter fits into theories of cosmology.""), then I think the book fails in its effort to give lay readers a grasp on the subject."

I could listen to him forever and I may need to before I really understand half of what he is describing: And the fault is not his - the fault is in the stars - it’s just an enormous topic for my story centered brain: Hopefully after a few more listens my mind will e Pandora along with universe and “grok” the magnificent splendor of astrophysics - I’ll be able to move beyond our solar system and Milky Way. The audio was the way to go for me. It is about six hours long, divided into chapters that each have their focus. Many thrilled my heart and I felt like I was traveling on an inter-stellar ride through the universe holding my breath, eyes wide in astonishment: other times my mind clouded over and it was obscured by a mist of interstellar dust. DeGrasse has such a warm rich voice, his examples are clear and engaging - he is a wonderful guide. I know I will listen to this again and again, a chapter or two at a time, He has made me feel equally in awe of what scientists have been able to learn and how much more we have yet to unravel.

Once again, I'm afraid, the answer is a big fat “nope.” Neil de Grasse Tyson has managed to give an extra little twist of the dagger to my not unexpected result by titling his book “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.” Not only am I failing to master astrophysics as dumbed down for “ordinary readers” – I'm flummoxed by cosmic matters as simplified in a pamphlet for joggers with ADD. Ouch!At least, though, de Grasse's cheerful, breezy style made my humiliation a pleasant experience. And he does his level best to make all the business about quarks, dark matter, dark energy, dwarf galaxies, etc. comprehensible. No math here. Simple explanations. It's just that, like God explaining how he slapped together the universe – “some gravity, some matter, some anti-matter, and bing-bang-boom! It was good!” – to the angels around the old heavenly campfire, sometimes the “simple” explanations don't really convey as much as the listener might like. Actually, in later chapters he elaborates just enough that I could often imagine I was catching on, but his first sentence really is a doozy.”In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.”It's not like it's a big period, either. I'm not a bit mathy, but even I can grasp that one-trillionth of a period is very, very small. And all the matter in the universe. Not just my local galaxy. All the hundred billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, not to mention planets. And, Tyson later explains, there's also tons of stuff that's between the galaxies. Among the galaxies. Holy cow. Basically, more biggness than I can conceive of crammed into something of more smallness than I can conceive of. And, like I said, that's the first sentence. So, “no math” just doesn't solve the problem.To be fair, once we get past the first two minutes following the Big Bang, things Do become less “crazy” (by which I mean, incomprehensible to me) and I was able to understand a reasonable amount of what Tyson was talking about. But it's a short, fast book and losing my footing right out of the gate was rough. From Chapter 2 on, however, Tyson generally succeeds in making really complicated subjects seem somewhat comprehensible and always interesting, but every so often he throws in a little gem like this...”We don't know who's next in the genius sequence, but we've now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we've measured in the universe – about eighty-five percent of it – arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn't come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.”On the one hand, his modesty about scientific knowledge is endearing, but on the other... “essentially clueless” about what's creating eighty-five percent of the gravitational force in the universe??? So, you've got a pretty good handle on fifteen percent of it? One can't help being reminded of the old S. Harris cartoon where the two scientists are looking at an equation on a blackboard where the central portion reads “then a miracle occurs.” Still, I'm sure that all the young physicists out there are heartened to know that there are still “gaps” to be filled and glory to be gained, so there is that!As I said, though, my own intellectual shortcomings aside, this is very well done for what it is – a very short, light overview of current astrophysics. If you can't remember how dark energy differs from dark matter, how scientists figure out which distant stars might have “habitable” planets, how scientists know as much as they do about the history of the universe, how come Pluto got booted from the list of planets, etc., this will get you back up to speed. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on dark energy, on the fine quality of “roundness, and, probably because it brought things closer to “my” scale, on our own solar system. Aside from the overwhelming first chapter, it was all enjoyable. A few passages, in particular, stood out as memorable. His description of pulsars, which are really dense, really rapidly rotating stars...”With some rotating at upward of a thousand revolutions per second, we know that they cannot be made of household ingredients, or they would spin themselves apart. In fact, if a pulsar rotated any faster, say 4,500 revolutions per second, its equator would be moving at the speed of light, which tells you that this material is unlike any other. To picture a pulsar, imagine the mass of the Sun packed into a ball the size of Manhattan. If that's hard to do, then maybe it's easier if you imagine stuffing about a hundred million elephants into a Chapstick casing.”Or this, rather more lyrical passage, where he explains what constitutes, for practical purposes, anyway, the “edge” of our universe (he's open to the idea of multiverses, and mentions that multiple universes of this sort could exist, not interacting, in a single space-time continuum)...”The sphere to end all spheres – the largest and most perfect of them all – is the entire observable universe. In every direction we look, galaxies recede from us at speeds proportional to their distance. As we saw in the first few chapters, this is the famous signature of an expanding universe, discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929. When you combine Einstein's relativity and the velocity of light and the expanding universe and the spatial dilution of mass and energy as a consequence of that expansion, there is a distance in every direction from us where the recession velocity for a galaxy equals the speed of light. At this distance and beyond, light from all luminous objects loses all its energy before reaching us. The universe beyond this spherical “edge” is thus rendered invisible and, as far as we know, unknowable.”And finally, a timely tidbit given the total solar eclipse coming up in just over a week (August 21, 2017)...”Earth's Moon is about 1/400th the diameter of the Sun, but it is also 1/400th as far from us, making the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky – a coincidence not shared by any other planet-moon combination in the solar system, allowing for uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.”I didn't realize! And that's a final thing I liked about this book. Tyson concludes with a chapter about the attitudes and “lessons” that one can take from pondering the universe. He mentions a psychologist who contacted him, wanting to administer a survey to visitors at a planetarium where Tyson was hosting a show, to test his theory that thinking about the universe would make people feel depressed. Tyson says he thinks that professor had things exactly wrong. Instead of depression, Tyson believes that considering our place in the cosmos, while humbling, should lead us to a deeper appreciation of the beauties of interstellar space, but also to a wonder of the “universal” laws of physics; to a recognition of the smallness of the Earth as compared with the vastness of space, but also to an understanding of our planet's preciousness; and of the opportunities our intelligence and curiosity offer us to improve life on our planet for all its inhabitants, and to the value of continuing to push at the borders of our knowledge."

289,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book is a compilation of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s essays on popular science for Natural History magazine. The title is a bit of a misnomer. It serves more as a refresher of scientific principles that many have studied in school, and assumes the reader understands at least some of the basics. I enjoyed listening to the author’s narration of the audiobook. He explains scientific theories in a straight-forward manner. Starting with the big bang, the author breaks down the universe into its many components, including such topics as planets, exoplanets, dark matter, stars, dark energy, chemical elements, quarks, comets, asteroids, and so on. He covers a variety of scientific discoveries and physical laws.I found this short volume to be an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the universe. It is easy to read and understand. The author even throws in a bit of wit and humor to keep it fun. "
290,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie,5,"At my age - almost old enough to be a great-grandmother but young enough to be happy that I'm not - I won't pretend to be in a hurry to do much of anything. But ever since I was a farm kid watching a star-filled sky on a blanket in our back yard, I've wanted to know more about how it all came about. Astronomy was my favorite part of science class, and I never missed an episode of late astrophysicist Carl Sagan's Cosmos"" - nothing short of fascinating stuff, at least when it's presented in a way that's informative, entertaining and, most importantly, understandable to a totally nonscientific person like me.Needless to say, I gravitated straight toward this book. And in fact, it's very easy read; in short, to-the-point (and footnoted) chapters, topics are addressed like dark matter, dark energy and black holes as well as how planets, galaxies and other cosmic ""stuff"" get found. Everything is presented in a down-to-earth (so to speak) and often humorous manner. And eye-opening? Check this: ""In the beginning, nearly 14 billion years ago, all the space, all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.""Wowsa!The author, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and director of the Hayden Planetarium doesn't preach, but neither does he hesitate to tackle current hot buttons, such as those who think chemicals are the enemy of humans. Citing scientific evidence that suggests otherwise, he quips, ""Personally, I am quite comfortable with chemicals, anywhere in the universe. My favorite stars, as well as my best friends, are made up of them.""If I got nothing else out of the book, it is that we humans take ourselves way too seriously in the overall scheme of things. The author keeps things in mind-boggling perspective: At a relatively early age, he reports, he learned that more bacteria live and work in one centimeter of his colon than the number of people who have ever existed in the world.Here are a few other revelations (to me, at least):*One pound of plutonium generates 10 million kilowatt-hours of heat energy - enough to power a human being for 11,000 years ""if we ran on nuclear fuel instead of grocery food.""*Apparently, Sagan was on to something: Our galaxy contains more than 100 billion stars, and known universes have some 100 billion galaxies. *There are more molecules of water in an 8-ounce cup than there are cups of water in all the world's oceans. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on any beach.*Einstein was a badass.Say what? There's a story behind that last one, but you'll just have to read the book to find out what it is. And with that, I'll end my review with a favorite quote from the book:""The power and beauty of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them."""

I'm not a physicist but I have a background in science and DeGrasse Tyson really helped fill in holes in my knowledge. DeGrasse Tyson's style of writing flows wonderfully.I especially loved the last, more philosophical, essay.Thanks to Netgalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."

In other words, after the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brings his expertise and finesse to the writing, and this serves as a noble effort to describe some of the complex processes *ever*. Highlights for me were the chapters on the astronomical origins of the periodic table, light and telescopes, and exoplanets. I loved the last chapter on consciousness, compassion, and unity, and I really admire him for including this in the Astrophysics primer."
294,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova,5,"A fun and easily digestible introduction to astrophysics. A lot of what was covered shouldn't be new to anyone who's paid attention during high school classes. If my textbooks were written this way I probably would have remembered more :) I recommend this to everyone, even if you don't learn anything new you'll enjoy the way the information is presented and I would especially recommend it physics teachers everywhere because this is the way to get young minds engaged in what you teach."
295,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16737952-jelena,5,"I like to think of myself as a comparatively educated person, both formally and essentially. Essentially, ever since I can remember, the core principle for navigating through life has been to base your opinion not on hunches and passions but on verified and verifiable facts, to go with what is plausible rather than convenient, to change perspective ever so often, to revise your stand when faced with facts that disprove you believes and to differentiate between emotions and knowlegde. (Thanks for that, Mum, I love you!) On the other hand, I am embarrassingly over my head into humanities and am basically an idiot savant: While I’m relatively good with concepts and mechanism in the social and cultural branch, to be honest I suck at everything else. I tried to pick up as much as I was capable of in the scientific field, especially knowing that my core interests have always lain elsewhere, but I rarely understood my school textbooks beyond the basics and was always more interested in warp drives than in lengthy equations I’d never put to use. (I wouldn’t be putting those warps drives to use either, but they were just way cooler.)This being said, I have a slightly weird sense of awe when it comes to Neil deGrasse Tyson. If you have ever heard him speak, you know what you’ll be getting. He writes in the same manner. His style is quick, vivid, palpable. On top of that, all of these twelve essays are fairly short, as the titular reference to hurry would suggest. Of all the covered topics, you’d already know about two thirds and one third would be new information. Of the very essential facts, everything is familiar. Apart from some newly gained insight, I am sure that NdGT hasn’t said anything that my physics teacher hasn’t told us about. But you see, my physics teacher had the exact demeanour and appearance of a very blond Nelson van Alden (Boardwalk Empire) and we used to call him “SS”, and not for his initials. So maybe there’s that to consider, too. Here, everything is bursting with life and energy. NdGT’s catching enthusiasm for an already marvellous and mesmerising topic, along with his talent to illustrate the bits and pieces of information and combine them, conveys such a thrill. It gave me a pure adrenaline rush and excitement with what I was able to understand and process. And it just fuels a hunger for further and further reading and learning. And what could be better than a lust for knowledge?There is another thing: the last essay in this edition, titled “Cosmic Perspective”. When in need of a bed-time story or a good-morning story, when looking for something you could and should as well read on a monthly basis ever since you learn the alphabet and for as long as you live – I guess this would be it.And if you’re looking for cons, there are several really corny jokes in here."
296,0393609391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,4,"I am fascinated by the discoveries in astrophysics and enjoy the success of Neil deGrasse Tyson in bringing its wonders to popular culture. I found Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (really a collection of about a dozen essays) an entertaining and thought-provoking journey as an audiobook read by the author. You will see 4 stars above but my rating is a tad lower than that. It may be because the format does not lend itself to pausing and digesting what is a whirlwind journey through the elements of astrophysics. So, if I may offer some advice: - Don’t hesitate to hit the pause button or go back a section to give the material a chance to settle more permanently in your memory.- Don’t read/listen to too much at one sitting. This is a very high-level view of subject matter that involves complex mathematics and advanced chemistry and biology (all of which is not on display).Tyson is a great treasure for those of us who are not scientists, mathematicians or well-versed in the natural sciences. He is trying to bring us all along on a fascinating exploration of a topic that will continue to have more impact on our daily lives and the future of our species. He has my gratitude for doing so."

This book is full of mind blowing speeds and distances and timescales and sizes. Tours of the periodic table and of the solar system's moons. There are lots of fantastic ideas but with a sobering thought at the end. Contemplating the stars does not have to make you forget what is going on right here on Earth."

If you're too busy to absorb the cosmos via classes, textbooks, or documentaries, and you nonetheless seek a brief but meaningful introduction to the field, this is really a great, informative book.It's Neil deGrasse Tyson. It's about astrophysics. My inner child and nerd are both satisfied. :D"
