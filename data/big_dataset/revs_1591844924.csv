The recent book ""Automate This: How Algorithms came to rule our world"" by Christopher Steiner gives a good overview of many of the fields in which computers have achieved or surpassed human performance, whether in game play [2018 EDIT: (Chess (Deep Blue), Jeopardy (Watson))], medical prescriptions (diagnosis and fulfillment) or even music (judging potential, composing)."

Jarecki made his way over to the Nobel laureate. “You know, you still have our Nobel Prize,” Jarecki said to Scholes. The remark elicited a dry grimace. “He was not amused,” Jarecki says. (c)Q:The financial industry, as is the case with most high-paying fields, tends to be dominated by men who are wont to hire more men. So when Peterffy hired the tallest, prettiest, most buxom women he could find, the plan was more than a bit novel. The tactic worked miracles for his order flow. Suddenly, the specialists always took his trades. They put their arms around his traders, chitchatted, and recognized the blondes’ orders as fast as they were issued. “The specialists were thinking, ‘These dumb blondes, what do they know, right?’” Peterffy says.It’s true that the women Peterffy hired didn’t know much about trading, let alone algorithms. But none of his traders at that time were any good out on their own. And none of them were using the sheets for guidance anymore. Peterffy had devised a new system that empowered anybody to make smart trades. (c)Q:The key to it all was a dependable flow of pure data that few others had. And data, as so many hot companies of today have demonstrated, can be the difference between domination of an industry and failure. Peterffy’s operation pioneered the automated compilation and employment of vast data stores on Wall Street, where the mining of such things got its start. (c)Q:He explained his success: “You gotta be able to calculate doo-boop-be-deeliyaboop—deal! I can do that.” He had learned math, he said, studying astronomy in the Netherlands and in the air force ...Van Peebles’s story accentuated the success of the most improbable trading squad roaming the pits of New York, perhaps to this day: three blonde women and one highly acclaimed black writer, director, and actor, all of them well-disguised proxies of an algorithm that dwelled inside a machine. (c)Q:Technically, a market maker is required to keep both bids and offers up at all times, no matter where the market goes. But Peterffy had been bending the rules, as a lot of market makers did, cherry-picking the trades he wanted according to the instructions of his algorithm. At no point was he maintaining constant bids and offers. (c)Q:O’Connor was so secretive about its methods that when it bought two hundred Symbolics computers in the mid-1980s, executives shredded the packaging so Dumpster-diving competitors couldn’t determine what technology the firm used.

2,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12689401-jakub-rehor,3,"Not really a book, more of an extended magazine article, ""Automate This"" goes on an ""awww look, isn't it amazing"" tour of some of the cutting edge applications of computers in multiple industries. It's an uneven journey, suffering from the superficial knowledge of the author, who seems an easy mark for the more self-promotional characters in the industries covered.About half of the book deals with Wall Street, and shows huge blind spots. Steiner is completely focused on high-frequency trading (HFT) which replaced human market-makers on stock and options exchanges. He misses the potentially bigger story of quantitative investment management and statistical arbitrage, sources of much bigger fortunes than HFT and arguably a greater break in the finance paradigm than HFT which does exactly what human market-makers used to do, only faster. Steiner hypes the Flash Crash of 2011, a non-event of interest only to market geeks, and ignores completely the meltdown of stat-arb powerhouse Long-Term Capital Management which almost brought down the US financial system in 1998.To me, the most interesting parts of the book were those dealing with computer applications outside of Wall Street, which I wasn't familiar with. I wonder, though, if those sections suffer from the same defects as the Wall Street parts... "

Don't be scared yet, but read the book to find what is waiting us behind the corner. Highly recommended, bought it today on BookOutlet (https://bookoutlet.ca/Store/Details/9...) - for $5.79 you cannot beat the price - planning to read it more times."
4,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15052120-howard-b,5,"Christopher Steiner does an excellent job of explaining algorithms, the ""bots"" that implement them, and the areas they have been applied to.Based on detailed interviews with people who developed them, he describes the importance they have in areas of:finance,speech recognition,psychological profiling,news reporting,medical diagnosis,musical composition,intelligence gathering and interpretation,games,customer service,identity theft,corporate communications.Automation in the financial markets is one of the major topics of the book. To give one example, his description of Thomas Peterffy's progression from knowing nothing about the financial markets, through building a robot to type orders to buy and sell stocks, to his founding of Interactive Brokers is fascinating.He documents the diversion of engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists first into the financial industry, then out of it. He provides clear evidence that computer automation is affecting social behavior, advertising, commerce, and employment. He makes a strong case for improvement in education -- particularly in areas of mathematics and science.I am a retired university professor of computer science. During my professional career, I have been involved in some of the areas Mr. Steiner describes, and I continue to write about methods ordinary individuals can use to create their own ""bots"" to manage their own investment accounts. Christopher Steiner has it right. He has written an excellent, entertaining, and highly readable book. If, as it appears to be the case, the future is Automate Everything, then ""Automate This"" is a good place to learn what is ahead for us all. "
5,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/777176-dave,4,"When you hear ""This call may be recorded for quality purposes,"" Steiner says you're often hearing a company warning you that an algorithm (or ""bot"") is about to listen in on your call to determine what kind of person you are. In 30 seconds the bot characterizes you and may match you with a similar personality type working in customer service.This has all kinds of implications for medicine, law, accounting, and many other service fields that would seem at first glance to be immune to the powers of quantification. But the takeover of bots is coming, according to Steiner.Bots have already begun to take over entertainment (Pandora, Netflix, this very site), and they will soon replace pharmacists, some legal functions, and more.Steiner's book is a fun read, beginning with the rise of algorithms in the world of finance. That part was the most entertaining to me. But the whole book is most engaging and easy to read."
6,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"Summary: Great book with wonderfully curated examples of how automation has come to pass. I don't love the conclusion. I don't think Steiner meant to do it, but it seems a bit negative.Automate This has wonderful Wall Street, Medical, and Musical examples that draw a person in. I find what he has to say super relevant. My concern is that his conclusion of that the future belongs to algos and that we should teach STEM somewhat misses the point of the automation, which is to augment human life so that we, i.e. people, can do something else. That something else is scary, but it can also be beautiful and not related to STEM, which... quite frankly, are just iterations of itself (Science is the physical application of Math and Engineering and technologies are just off-shoots of applied Science or Math)."
7,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"This book is the nugget of what could have been a much better and is just good enough to make me frustrated that it wasn't better.The contention of this book is that more and more of our lives are ruled or influenced by algorithms, sets of instructions that provide a somehow optimized outcome based on simple yes or no decisions. The sections outlining the history of alogrithms are quite interesting and involve a tour of Arab mathematics and the work of Bool and Liebniz but the discussion on modern algorithms is disappointing. The author seems to use algorithm almost any time his criterion is met and this can lead to confusion. He calls Chaos Theory an outgrowth of set theory which I consider at best a stretch and confuses objective vs. subjective. Finally, the author seems to refer to just about all math as algorithms which while being technically accurate when applied doesn't mesh with how I think most people use the term.The opening few chapters are wonderful as it tracks the personal story of a Wall Street wiz but the end where he hammers on about people leaving Wall Street for Silicon Valley seems out of place. His commentary on how the future workforce will be full of the displaced is reasonable but the logic is undeveloped and leaves much to the imagination.Finally, the book leaves the reader wanting for hard information about how modern algorithm development works and treats them as a black box. I think this is a disservice to the reader and developers of data-intensive applications."
8,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,5,"Most people when they hear the word automation think of large factories. The factories were the only place where automation was present for a long while, but the author shows us the places where automation has slowly crawled in and even taken over. The most surprising thing for me was the importance of Wall Street in this change. This book was incredibly enlightening for me, not just because this is what I am studying for, but also as a major wake up call. "
9,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75494058-ahmed-e,5,"It's not usual for me to give a 5 to a book that is not fictional. But this book is different. I got it late. I mean the book is released at 2012 andI bought it at 2017. I read it at 2020. I could only imagine it would be a life changer to me if I could read it earlier. If you love science, then you must read it. If you like programming, then you must read it. If you want to know about technology, then you must read it. And finally, if you really think you understand how are the things in your life is working, then you definitely must read it. Because, you are WRONG. It might seem to be a shallow book about certain information of programming. But I assure you. If you look deep, this is a very serious book. It is handful and could guide you to a better future."
10,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38490906-amir-dov,2,"With the exception of the first chapter which deals with Thomas Peterffy and the creation of Interactive Brokers, the book contributed very little useful information to my knowledge. I guess the message is that we've made huge progress in what can be written into an algorithm compared with what people thought is possible a few decades ago, but isn't that kind of obvious? Yes, the ability to use computers in order to solve what seemed to be unsolvable in the past is pretty remarkable. But the book just doesn't go deep enough into the details - it just uses some anecdotal evidence that I guess suppose to create some kind of ""wow"" effect with the reader. However, if you already knew that algorithms have a big role in our lives nowadays, this book will not expand your knowledge in a meaningful way."
11,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6816655-maheswaran,4,"I should maybe stick to my rule of not rating any tech books here. I am sure I will be very biased and will mostly give it a 4 or 5. I usually have something or the other that I find very interesting in there. I thoroughly enjoyed each area that the author explored and how algorithms have changed it. From Wall Street trading to the music industry. Well, a lot. I felt small having not done anything big from a tech perspective. But I too have felt ripples of someone losing a job to a code that I put in. Lets not go there. A very interesting read for a techie. Should be interesting for others as well to understand what is going on. "
12,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63069148-garrett-lachney,3,"This book seemed a little myopic in its breadth of material covered. I would say half, or perhaps even more than half, of the book was devoted to how algorithms have revolutionized Wall Street. I got the impression early on that the author’s research was weighted in this direction; perhaps this is the world he lives in or the people he interviewed most, and therefore the material he felt most comfortable writing about. The rest of the book read as surface-level anecdotes where algorithms were put to work doing various things, like making music, optimizing customer service lines, or helping to read medical diagnostic scans.What left me with a really sour taste in my mouth was a claim that was made near the end of the book. The essence of it was that unless you know how to write algorithms, your job will be replaced by one. While I don’t argue with the general intent of this premise (in the long run), I felt that the book laid very, very shaky groundwork to make that kind of statement.Like I mentioned, aside from the Wall Street examples, much of the book is anecdotal: how a few companies have implemented or are implementing algorithms to improve things. And the idea that, just because algorithms exist, means that “human versions” of those creations are irrelevant is not based on anything. There’s a chapter on music, for example. Algorithms can create wonderful music, as good as the most fluent of songwriters. Does that mean that the “demand” for singer/songwriters goes away? Maybe, maybe not, but this is not addressed. AI was also not addressed at all. How can there be a meaningful discussion about automation taking over the world without talk of machine learning? I’ve also read claims that AI will CREATE the algorithms that automate work one day. Wouldn’t that invalidate Steiner’s whole claim that there will always be demand for good quant people? The bad here is overcome somewhat by a few things: a) I felt the writing style was excellent. The tone was consistent, topics flowed nicely, and explanations were concise. b) I know more about this stuff than I did when I picked up the book. That’s the first thing I look for when I read non-fiction. c) the anecdotes from other chapters, shallow as they may have been, were interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the quest for a new fiber optic line between Chicago and New York or the way a European musician got his start thanks to a tech startup that analyzed music. In my opinion, he needed to either leave the last chapter out of the book where the claim is made that algorithms will take over everything OR provide a broader discussion about machine learning, AI, algorithms, and job/trade data to back up that assertion in a more meaningful way.

14,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10507353-allan,3,"Chapter 7 entitled Categorizing Humankind enters the nebulous world of personality inventories. Excepting astrology, these all have a grain of truth. Often a grainy grain. I regard personality as a messy ball of string. Just about any halfway sensible metric is tangent to a bundle of threads somewhere in the ball of string. You can pretty much count on your standard-issue TV dinner personality inventory tray (Chicken Risotto Tonight) to contain a largish compartment for extroversion/introversion, a medium compartment for thinking/feeling, with side orders of impulsivity/self-control or intuition/judgment or dominance/submission. There's a thousand ways to cover the personality food groups, and a dozen companies with fat binders and seminars to convince you otherwise. My own ""one meal to rule them all"" would consist of bacon, mushrooms, parsley, shrimp, and Parmesan in a white wine reduction. Against this standard, I could assess everything else I eat. Clearly an astronaut should have a lot of bacon, yet not too much parsley or white wine. Your creative type at IDEO would have much of these, less of the others. I had not heard of Dr Terry McGuire or Dr Taibi Kahler, or their influence at NASA. Turns out that reflections-driven people (who would rather think about what could be than what is) are almost non-existent within NASA's manned space program. They might perhaps have applied next door. This chapter presents the work of these psychologists as the beginning point on an arc of technology leading to automated personality detection bots deployed in corporate call centers. Other sources I consulted prefer to downplay the importance of personality profiling in astronaut selection at NASA: Wanted in Space: Gregarious Loners Who Take Risks, CautiouslyWhen I watch TED talks I frequently mutter ""TED porn"" as the audience breaks into spontaneous applause. It's a clearly identifiable sub-genre, alongside the sister genres of Freak-porn (Freakonomics) and Glad-porn (Malcolm Gladwell). And there are also minor tributaries, such as Five Equations That Changed the World: The Power and Poetry of Mathematics or the recurring article at Wired.com This Black Object Will Kill You Dead. On this handy pornventory, Steiner fashions his narratives from bacon and parsley. The bacon sometimes degenerates into bacon-bits, if you dig into the hard stuff a little deeper. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining read. A tip of the hat for directing me to a personality inventory one can actually use: the Right Stuff (opinionated team players), the Wrong Stuff (competitive bickerers and back-biters), and No Stuff (neurotics, dreamers and back-benchers). "
15,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/659583-keith,3,"Some harsh reviews here on GoodReads - too journalistic, too superficial. Nevertheless, for dummies like me this was an enjoyable discovery of the many, many ways algorithms are influencing our lives. The idea of a ""bot"" as your doctor is quite attractive given the ever-increasing levels of complexity and change that your average general practitioner must master in order to give -hopefully - an accurate diagnosis of a patient complaint. The inside story of tracking down the exact chords that open The Beatles song ""Help,"" apparently a long held mystery, with algorithms is fascinating. Some of the older Wall Street hacks are interesting and demonstrative of a rebellious entrepreneurial spirit, the guy who hacked the NASDAQ machine is one example or the people who built their own private dark fiber network between New York and Chicago is another. What Chris Steiner does, and this is, I think, the core of the book, is to irrevocably demonstrate what happened when Wall Street set out to rule the world with algorithms. Faster and faster transactions and increasingly bizarre financial instruments (CDOs anyone?) plus a persistent and raucous vacuuming up of the top engineering and computer science talent in the country. By early 2008, automated bots accounted for 60 percent of all U.S. stock market trades, and the financial industry had spent seven years sucking up every deft graduating engineer, physicist, and general Renaissance man who had even a mild attraction to a large starting salary and a bonus big enough to buy most Americans’ homes twice over. Wall Street had grown to become a larger hirer of math, engineering, and science graduates than the semiconductor industry, Big Pharma, or the telecommunications business.The result of this is exemplifed in the observations of Duke professor Vivek Wadhwa: “As a new faculty member at Duke, Wadhwa watched as many of his brightest students ended up on Wall Street, conjuring up the very instruments that would lead the world to the brink of economic collapse—collateralized debt obligations, the Gaussian copula (a fine formula that was misused by the Street), and trading algorithms that could go wild at any moment.”In his conclusions Steiner sees a silver lining in the crash of 2008 and the consequent massive layoffs from Wall Street which is the migration of much of that quantitatively oriented brain power to Silicon Valley. This is a changes of focus to using data for ends more social than financial. Steiner is not all apple pie and roses carefully noting some of the inherent problems that a data-driven society must be aware of. A readable tale of changes affecting us all. "
16,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5001811-maree,4,"A fascinating glimpse into the future as well as the open secret world of bots that quietly exists around us today. While I thought I was pretty up on technology, there were still algorithms that I hadn't realize existed, such as ones that compose music, or the ones that match you to similar personalities in a call center. It's amazing, and perhaps a little scary. But as the author says, they aren't going away any time soon, and I believe that they have the capability for a lot of good.I really got blocked in chapter two when the history of man and math popped up. It was a little much for my english major brain. But after that, the real world examples of what code and algorithms are doing, starting in the stock market and graduating to the future of healthcare, is definitely worth absorbing. Another great point was the section on NASA astronaut training. I knew they had some serious personality tests going on in there, but reading about how some of the psychs could figure out their personalities and how they might work/clash with others just after ten minutes of conversation made me want to learn more about it too. I may have to look it up. I'd definitely say that I lead with thoughts-based.I obviously missed my calling. Should have became a quant and earned millions. But that math/science death march got to me in junior college. Guess that's what I get for taking the easy way out. The end of the book talks about how everyone should take a programming class in school. That's something I'd 100% support for any of my future kids, not to turn them into quants, mind you, but to give them a greater understanding of this new world they would be born into that is going to rely on algorithms to do the heavy lifting."
17,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3132060-andrea-james,3,"As a number of the other Goodreads reviewers have mentioned, this is like an extended magazine article, albeit a rather enjoyable one I reckon. The book is light reading and doesn't go into the technical side of algorithms but I thought the author told the stories relatively well (in a typical Malcolm Gladwell way, a style that seems to dominate popular science books these days).I picked up in this book because bots are getting increasing better at making decisions and it's interesting to learn examples when computers are being used - either to do jobs that humans were never able to do or to replace the ones that we used to do. We often think of computers as doing non-creative, repetitive calculations but the algorithms that engineers have been developing are really quite incredible. From composing music (which people aren't able to distinguish from human compositions) to listening into our phone calls so that they can match us up with a call centre agent who is better suited our personality. The latter may need more work from my experience :)Understanding how people make decisions feeds into machine learning but also the opposite is also true. By crunching the data on millions of decisions made, computers are able show patterns of our behaviour and show up what people actually do not what they say they intend to do. We can even monitor, analyse and record our own individual choices so that we can more honestly assess and improve our decisions. Well, until the machines completely take over our lives that is!All in all, it's a fun book especially if you are relatively new to this topic."
18,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,5,"Wow! An amazing read, the author is a master storyteller. In a story about automation, the author found a way to keep the audience engaged, throughout the book, I was hooked.The author begins with the incredible story of a Hungarian Immigrant hacking the Wall Street protocols to build an automaton that could trade. It then goes from one place to another in a sequence, it goes to match making for kidney transplants, goes on to, Health Care and Prescriptions, also touches on Paralegals, it also moves to the Silicon Valley and then goes back to the Wall Street again in quick succession. The Author delves into the history of automation, and of algorithms from the first person who created an algorithm, to the woman who wrote the concept of the first software and then flash forwards to the pioneers of various algorithms that changed the world. The story about saving 4 milli seconds between the NSE and Chicago, could only be described as a ""Rabbit Hole in the Wall Street"". The story about a scientist trying to build a music making machine, in a quest to decipher the mystery of the beetles first string, could only be described as ""Searching for a String in a haystack of Musical Noises"". Before reading the book, I was of the opinion that automation hasn't reached the doorsteps of intellectuals. I also had a few qualms that a few industries can never be touched by algorithms, due to the very creative nature of these jobs. But, the author made it extremely clear that nobody is safe from algorithms, no career is an exception, everybody can be automated, except may be the people building those automatons. So the only career that is worth pursuing is CODING!But that is not the best takeaway from this book, Yes, there is something much better that the author has dealt with in the penultimate chapter. He talked about the great concept of ""USING PHDs to do Janitors Work!""Even Better ""Converting The most productive and creative people in the nation into parasites and debt slaves""Much Better ""Using the best Engineering Talent in the country to count Beans""HE TALKED ABOUT THE TREND OF THE BEST MINDS IN THE COUNTRY SOLD OFF TO WALL STREET FOR A MILLION DOLLAR SALARIESLet me explain this vicious loop to my future self - in case I might forget this great concept.1. The Best minds of the country graduate from premier institutes, left to their own means they would pursue their passions and some of them eventually would strive to convert their passions into profits i.e. become entrepreneurs, this has always been the case with smart people!2. During this process, they create new ventures, companies and organizations that employ millions of people, create new industries and drive the engine of growth forward in a country. Eventually creating tax revenue generating BEHEMOTHS, say General Motors, Facebook, General Electric, Ford. The Entire Industrial prowess of USA lies in this VIRTUOUS CYCLE!3. Where ever there is growth, there are PARASITES, i.e. MIDDLEMEN who do little or no work, but start taking their cuts. FINANCE is one of the most vicious parasites, second to none is a FLYBOT PARASITE -RENT - The FIRE sector is general is the parasites that eats away most of the growth in an economy, even before it can reach the hands of the growth drivers and growth creators. There are other parasites, like corruption etc... but let us limit the discussion to FIRE parasites, since the author discussed them at length.4. The FIRE parasite then starts preying on everything in the economy, which causes the costs of every transaction to rise, i.e. the price of studying in college also skyrocket, as the prices increase, so will the stress of the graduating class, whose only though after graduation is ""LOAN ON MY HEAD""5. In an attempt to clear their loans faster, they take up the best paying jobs, the well paying jobs, often are in PARASITE SECTORS and INDUSTRIES - Why? It pays well to be able to take money without actually building anything! Yes, because they found a way to take a cut without producing anything of value! SO THEY ARE ABLE TO PAY MORE TO GRADUATING STUDENTS.6. These Graduating students are then employed in the PARASITE SECTORS, to improve the efficiency of these parasites, i.e. how to suck more blood and juice out of the system. There is a very beautiful term to describe this ""FINANCIAL ENGINEERING"", how do you engineer tools, such that you can take more money and more money, for the same goods and services. Such the last ounce of blood from the caracasses of the consumer, thereby the economy, which means that these graduates increase the efficiency of parasites, which further increase the prices i.e. the prices of the degree they obtain.7. There is a two pronged loss at play here 1. The best minds in the country are turned into parasites, hungry for money. 2. They are stolen from the otherwise CORE engineering INDUSTRIES that would have employed them to drive growth in the economy. Thus, with one stone called - STUDENT LOAN, you hit both the eyes of the bird (economy/country) and make it blind ! The opportunity cost of employing the best minds in the country away from building great companies and pushing them to become bean counters and build ever more complicated financial tools, i.e. various permutations and combinations of futures, forwards, options, swaps and other derivatives and selling them across various markets to save pennies for their money hungry masters! is extremely huge.8. The PARASITE sectors forget that they can only suck the blood of the economy which has ""GROWTH"" - Deprived of the great minds that drive growth, the economy starts to falter, but attenuating this wound are the very great minds, which have now become parasites and started searching all over the economy for ways to suck the LAST BLOOD from it. Eventually the economy become strained by a tug of war between these two factors, of no growth coupled with parasites drawing blood - eventually leading to a complete collapse i.e. the ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 20089. Which then release these great minds from the clutches of the failed PARASITE companies, and lets' them choose their real professions. i.e. engineering and driving real growth in the economy. This is the vicious loop of TOP GRADUATES GOING TO WALL STREET AND NOT TO MAIN STREET OR THE SILICON VALLEYThe author captured this in a beautiful way! That is why I love this book, so much."

The key areas the author focuses on: Wall Street and Finance, Hollywood, the music industry, customer service call centers, and of course social media. The author also devotes a small chunk of the book to giving credit to key mathematicians throughout history who have contributed either directly to the study of algorithms or indirectly by way of key mathematical concepts/advancements.Although the material is hardly ""light reading"", the author does a very good job of conveying heavy mathematical and technological concepts through examples, and also by way of leaving out unnecessary, confusing details that only small groups of people would even begin to understand."

Although it is not technical at all, the Author did manage to present the brief history behind algorithms and its various applications in our daily life in an engaging manner. I really liked parts of the book where Author mentions how Algorithms have come to play an important role for Wall Street and people who have worked for them. There are lot of interesting people mentioned in the book - Thomas Peterffy, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, Vivek Wadhwa, Andrew McAfee with lot of other interesting stories.

32,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58019001-roy-wang,4,"The book presents a riveting glimpse into some of the stories behind how algorithms and bots have been transforming all sorts of industries as well as the corollary effects on our daily lives over the past few decades. The transformation began in the hyper-competitive world of algorithmic trading on Wall Street where even a miniscule speed advantage in reliably detecting market anomalies can make fortunes, but soon spread to other fields that could also benefit from extraordinary pattern-spotting like music recordings, film production, horse racing, talent scouting in professional sports, online dating, chess competition, geopolitical risk management, medical diagnosis, and so on. Several years after the book's publication, AI and machine learning are now among the hottest tech buzzwords, already predicted by numerous industry experts to eliminate a large chunk of human jobs in the next decades. As the book suggests, there's no stopping sophisticated algorithms and bots from get better and better at taking the human element out of almost everything we do, leaving readers pondering the far-reaching, sociologically significant implications of having a group of data-crunching engineers and computer hackers shaping various aspects of our lives."
33,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11723162-b,4,"As other reviewers have noted, this book did indeed read like an extended magazine article and focused a bit too much on Wall Street, at least given what was advertised. Now, that being said, it was still an informative, well-written book. It should have been subtitled something like ""From Wall Street to Silicon Valley"" because that's more along the lines of its actual subject. The chapters on algorithms in music and medicine seemed like detours from the main story. However, I do appreciate the author's main insight - algorithms first broke onto the scene in finance. Had they not demonstrated their ability here, they may never have moved on to revolutionize other areas. The shift from Wall Street to Silicon Valley has coincided with algorithms impacting much more than just trading stocks. Ultimately, my opinion is that though this will cause some growing pains for the human race as a whole, the emergence of algorithms will probably lead to a better future for humanity. "

From the trading floor of Wall Street to NASA mission control hub to local customer call centre. All of them utilized algorithms to become better, faster, and efficient in mundane but complex tasks. This allows uncontrollable yet specific conditions to be optimized, providing fertile ground for generating profit through monetization of the algorithms. Steiner roughly scratched the surface on the history of the algorithms but that what makes this book worthwhile. It tells a story of how algorithms were applied in different technologies and industries. The stories engaging and structured in a way that is easy to be followed by somebody who is outside the domain. The description is vivid and impactful, sparking my interest to know more all about it."

I also like how we follow different people as characters that introduce us to a certain topic.However, I loathe the ending. The book itself raises a couple of questions we should be addressing, but the conclusion completely subverts everything by just telling the readers to accept the reality as it is and let's all just be engineers from now on. I'm still giving it 4 stars because the book did open my eyes and I really was impacted by the book and I'd gladly recommend it. "
38,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17955117-pascal-schuppli,3,"I let myself be mislead by the title and the first few pages when I bought this book.The title evokes a strange image in my mind: It's of Sarah Connor (from the Terminator movie) shooting a Terminator and saying ""Automate this!"" over it's sparking remains. But it seems the title is meant literally - the author gives you a list of things that are, can be or should be automated. It gives some neat examples, too, although much of the book is centered on millisecond trading on Wall Street.It also tries to show that algorithms aren't just gaining in areas where we expect them to (Wall Street and Tech), but also in areas that are generally believed to belong to the creative, such as music, the management of sports teams, or areas such as medical diagnostics and psychology. However, the treatment of these areas is very shallow.For example, the author tells about a method to classify a person's personality based on a few minutes of their speech. This probably works to a certain degree, and maybe an automated system doing this works well enough to match callers and call center employees so that problem resolution statistics show an improvement over not doing any matching at all. But this matching is done to solve a very narrow, well-defined problem. The same goes for the automated composing of music and haikus or the automated writing of news pieces for things like sports games. However, the author doesn't point this out. This creates the impression that algorithms which perform better than randomly in such narrow niches (or even pass Turing tests in these niches) are ready to be used in completely different circumstances as well - in a school setting or in a doctor's office, for example. Now I personally don't mind if I get routed to a different customer service agent because a computer calculates that our personalities match, because this simply doesn't matter in my life. The experience for customers calling a call center is so abysmal that it's hard to make it any worse. It's quite another story to give algorithms control over which doctors we can talk to, or which schools our children get assigned to.What I wanted from this book is not just a list of things algorithms do or might one day do for us. I'd have liked to hear about the context in which these algorithms work - how we decide that an algorithm is good enough to give it give control over something; how we determine that we're not just creating self-fulfilling prophecies, how we deal with algorithm failures. Where we decide to only use them as recommendation engines, and where we we hand over control. Questions like that.The book is best where it touches these topics, but unfortunately it never does more than that. 2008 showed that the algorithms Wall Street used were flawed (to put it nicely), and the book acknowledges that, but there is no followup. No discussion about what the capability to do microsecond trading is actually good for, either (nothing?). The book mentions that machine learning builds models out of data from the past and therefore isn't able to come up with original stuff (e.g. computers can write music in the style of Bach, or Beethoven - but not in an entirely new style) - but the implications aren't discussed. Do we lock ourselves into the past when we let models of the past control the present without allowing for human intervention? Do we impoverish the world because it becomes locked into a system of logic interactions, or do we enrich it because we free people from mindless tasks to concentrate on thinking up new stuff? Can we manage the complexity of interacting algorithms? I'd like to read arguments pertaining to these questions.And finally: *Should* we have algorithms treat patients? Lowering mortality rates seems like a good argument for it, but what are the arguments against it? There is no such thing as a free lunch, so what do we lose? The book portrays the algorithmic future in health care as a golden age without drawbacks. Really? Should we have robots look after the infirm and elderly? What about education? Even if we could, *should* we have computers teach our children? If we argue, as the author does, solely on the basis of measurable quantities such as mortality rates (or academic success rates), well, should we have children raised by robots once they're up to it? There is statistical evidence that parents are dangerous - a child is much more likely to be mistreated by a parent, or close relative, than by a stranger. Once the failure rate of robotic guardians is lower than that, should we hand over our kids to robots?A book about automation and algorithms, especially one that uses the word ""quant"" so much, should deal with what is measurable and what isn't. Unfortunately the book never comes around to even ask the question.When I started reading the book, it seemed like it was going to discuss such questions. After all, it starts with an example of two naive algorithms that are so broken that they drive the price of a book up to the fantastic sum of several million dollars. It opens, in other words, with an example of total algorithmic failure. Human intervention was required to fix the problem.But the book was interesting to read, because it gave several examples of algorithms used in production environments which I hadn't heard about yet, and it contained some interesting side stories such as the construction of the fibreoptic cable connection between Chicago and NY."
39,1591844924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38858012-amanda-hochstatter,3,The book contains several interesting anecdotes about the power of algorithms in our lives. The end of the book is in favor of paying teachers who teach coding/math more money than other teachers since this will fix all of societies challenges... “not enough US kids get a foundation of upper level math before arriving at college.” The author simultaneously glosses over all the complexities in society that contribute to this phenomena and takes the easy less responsible route of blaming teachers.
