It was a lot of good advice and had some nice humorous elements, but I feel like certain things were said 3 or 4 times. I usually like Dan Ariely's works, and while I did learn some things from this one, it didn't grab me the way his previous books did. "

I assumed it would be one of those “How to Make a Budget” type of books. Okay, I was completely wrong—it’s nothing of the kind. I enjoyed reading this book. DOLLARS AND SENSE by Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler explains how we think about money, with special emphasis on the frequent ways we think WRONGLY about money. It’s not that we are stupid about money; rather, we don’t think objectively, and are easily manipulated in some areas. I confess I am a bit of a chump and easily tricked by marketers, so this book was especially helpful to me. For example, I really like those big, “50% OFF!” signs. I’m not alone, says the author. Bargains make us feel “special and smart. They make us believe we’re finding value where others haven’t.” I completely understand what the authors are saying. Deep down, I know I’m being manipulated by the “Savings” signs, but I still like the feeling of getting a great deal.The authors discuss the “pain” of buying something. Not surprisingly, if there is little pain, we tend to “spend more freely and enjoy consuming things more.” That’s a big factor in using credit cards—they separate the moment of consuming from the pain of paying. “Credit cards capitalize on our desire to avoid the pain of paying.”One of the favorite sections is the discussion of “Fairness.” We tend to value things more highly if we know a lot of effort has gone into the product or service. If it seems like the seller is gouging us, we won’t buy their product—even when it is in our best interest to do so. The later part of the book provides suggestions to help us. First off, realize that some forces in our environment WANT us to make poor decisions. A bad decision by us means more money for them: “We fight a financial environment that actively tries to tempt us to make bad financial decisions. We live in a world where outside forces constantly want something from us.”I thought this one suggestion was the best advice in the book: “From time to time, let’s stop and question our long-term habits.” Maybe getting that expense coffee every day is not really a good idea.Here’s an interesting idea that helps us save more money: We can also create a “Ulysses Contract.” (Named after the classic story of Ulysses tying himself up to prevent responding to the call of the Sirens.) A Ulysses contract is a process we setup to “create barriers against future temptation. We give ourselves no choice.” The idea is, have some sort of automatic savings process, to try to fend off future temptations. The authors cite a study showing that savings increased 81% under an automatic savings scheme.So all in all, I found DOLLARS AND SENSE to be a fun, insightful read. It’s definitely not one of those “Make a Budget and Stick to it” type of financial planning books. The authors write clearly and includes a ton of examples, often citing scientific studies. I liked the funny illustrations by Matt Trower.Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher."

Would only recommend for those who have not already read Predictably Irrational and The Upside of Irrationality."
3,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"Covers some of the psychological bugs we have with money and spending. Some of the insights are found in other work by Arielly and some this stuff is found in Daniel Kahneman's ""thinking fast and slow"" and other behavioral economics works. Most of the cases are familiar from the literature."

Dan knows the art of explaining things with examples and personalities that you can relate to be it this book, the books before or the online MOOC. You'll find yourself constantly saying: ""Had I been in this situation, I would have done the same thing as this guy did"".One of the good ways this book differ from others in the same genre is how it won't tell you to get rid of the irrationality of human brain but rather how to embrace it. The theme of this book is not to make you spend less money, or live a frugal life but to make sure you make an informed decision and value(compare) the elements of a purchase that are important and not just elements that are comparable. Gives real life example of how every marketer is trying to confuse us by leveraging the flaws of our brain(like pain of paying OR relative pricing OR anchoring effect) and helps us play the game the other way round.The best takeaway for me from the book was: It is okay to chose to spend different amount of money on two exactly same things if one of them gives us more pleasure than other, and believe me, you'll get examples in the book where two exactly same things like vacation or wine can give amazingly different pleasure when presented/enjoyed in different ways."
5,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,3,"This is a better book if you haven't already read a ton of behavioral economics. For me, it was a compilation of a lot of effects I'd already read about (for example in Ariely's Predictably Irrational). This book would be great for people who don't know that much about behavioral economics who are interested in personal finance.I was also uncomfortable with the way the authors veered into territory that was somewhat morality- based without a holistic view of the issue. I fear economics often makes this mistake, but to my mind, behavioral economics is more sophisticated and shouldn't make this error. We've rejected the idea that humans make the most rational economic decisions. We've also learned that morality can be very closely tied to empathy and other emotional systems. So I didn't find the section on ""fairness"" to very sophisticated with regards to current economics, psychology, biology, or ethics research. Sure, you should pay the locksmith his rate for the reasons stated in this book, but I disagree that you shouldn't battle large companies like Netflix or Uber when they do something you consider unfair- and certainly when they do unethical things."
6,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,4,"In a nutshell,the author tries to show how our cognitive biases tend to affect our daily financial judgements and decisions.Again, If you are familiar with Dan Ariely`s previous work then you will revisit many of those ideas again in this book,but the book is still insightful,witful,contains alot of useful tips and I like the comic approach by his co-author,which made the book more interesting and hard to put it down.I highly recommend this,if you on quest of trying to understand how psychology of money works,I would also recommend another book, MIND over MONEY by Claudia Hammond,it also cover the same subject but on its own unique fantastic way."
7,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,5,"Another great book on the surprising way we really think. Our decisions about money, it turns out, are very sensitive to the last number we thought about right before that decision, our self-concept, and which category we put the money in. We will go to great lengths to avoid loss but blow off the chance to gain the same amount of money, for example. It’s not only an important book. It’s a funny book. Very well written. "
8,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2767513-veselin-nikolov,3,"I like Dan Ariely and read the book because of his name. This book, however, was a hard read and I didn't enjoy it. It says that thinking about money is hard but why would reading books about money be hard too?I think that it could only be useful for people who don't often read self-help."

12,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6790690-dave,4," This book is informative in that it lets us know things about ourselves (whether we want to admit them or not) that we never knew. The fact that we are prejudiced and swayed in ways we don't even recognize can be disconcerting. But as is pointed out, knowing about these unconscious biases can help us address them, and even use them to our advantage. It doesn't just show us the flaws that exist in our programming, it gives strategies to deal with them. But we first have to admit to ourselves that the flaws are there, whether we like them or not. Anyone reading this may want to either take extensive notes, or plan on re-reading it to get the most out of it.I listened to the audio version of this book. The narration is clear and well-paced. Even the mildly sarcastic interjections are well-read, with just a hint of audible devilishness by the narrator."

14,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,4,"Some three years ago, I belatedly came around to reading Ariely’s original masterpiece, “Predictably Irrational.” Here’s verbatim the summary of my findings:1.	Among two offerings, a merchant can reliably make us pick the one he prefers by sliding a “decoy” bad choice that is more similar to the choice he wants to steer us to2.	The first price we see for anything is the one we remember forever. Get that high “anchor” in and you can sell anything at a high price (and vice versa)3.	We are suckers for ambience/context. We won’t just pay up for a product if a setting looks upmarket or is sold in an upmarket setting, we’ll enjoy it more too. If something’s presented as expensive, basically, we are drawn to it almost automatically, with a very notable exception:4.	We’re drawn to stuff even more if it’s FREE! FREE! (with an exclamation mark, like Yahoo!) is a law unto itself5.	We can’t deal well with mixing social norms and market norms. We’ll do things for free that you could not possibly pay us to do. Conversely, if a price is put on something that has previously been rationed but free, the magic is gone and we can’t go back to looking at it through the prism of social norms6.	We can do some very stupid things when the “animal” inside us comes to the surface7.	We simply don’t have it in us to delay gratification. We’re not wired like that. We have to find ways to trick ourselves to save for a rainy day, to get medical checks etc.8.	We value stuff we own higher by dint of owning it. Our house, our stereo, theatre tickets, the lot. It all goes up in our estimation because it’s ours9.	We place immense value on keeping options open and waste disproportionate resources on keeping our options open relative to the potential benefit of exercising them10.	When we think something will be good, we end up liking it and when we think medicine will work it will end up working better!11.	In the same vein, a 50-Cent Aspirin can do things a 1-Cent Aspirin cannot12.	When nobody’s looking, we all cheat, but we don’t cheat too much, lest we end up feeling bad about ourselves13.	The more removed we are from actual cash, the less inhibited we are in our cheatingSmall Change covers exactly ZERO new ground, but omits point #5, point #6 and points #12Funnily enough, that makes it a better book. I guess the author has come to realise that nine of his thirteen points were about… money. So he got a very funny (but impossibly lazy, he could not even be bothered to dig beyond his personal experience for new stories/examples) co-author to repackage those ideas and hey, presto, a better-focused book is on the shelves.Also, a major beef of mine with psychologists is they have to get sex into everywhere, a fact that makes it impossible to recommend their books to my mom or even to read their work on the tube. With point #6 expunged, this is indeed a book you can recommend to your mom and a book you can read in the tube with little risk of embarrassment. Modulo the jarringly frequent invocation of a dominatrix throughout the text, that is.So to all those of you who’ve never read Dan Ariely before, you can now skip his original opus. Buy “Small Change” instead, supplement it with “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” and be on the lookout for his upcoming work on social norms vs. market norms.On the other hand, if you’ve already read “Predictably Irrational,” I can’t recommend buying this book. Like myself, you’ll feel robbed of your valuable reading time. And of whatever not-so-small change you paid for it, of course."
15,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55540215-lydia,4,"Very interesting read. There was a kiddie coaster of emotions. The ups and downs of 'I'm an idiot,' 'I'm not an idiot,' 'Humans are idiots,' 'the majority of us are going to die poor and forever working,' and 'no wait, we can trick ourselves into not being so idiotic!' I noticed at the grocery store after reading the book that I was thinking about my purchases more. I reasoned through the sales and gimmicks and actually saved $10 on what I normally spend. Did I also second guess those second guesses? Yes. Did I spend way more time in the store than I normally do? Yes. Did I buy unnecessary items or more items of a thing than I need? No. So I'm going to call it a win. This isn't a how to save money book or how to be better at investing. This book shows you how to reevaluate your spending habits, how you think about money and your spending habits, and how to be more cognizant of your money and how you spend and save it. I'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in human behavior and psychology, and personal finance. "
16,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2006699-tariq-mahmood,5,The book is ideal for someone like me who is a pathological and emotional spender of my own money. The book explains life-changing economic decisions with simple and relevant examples with plenty of funny anecdotes which made it into my best economy books to date. I think it will have an impact on my spending habits as I will try and make more informed decisions and try and keep my emotions in check :(
17,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42440228-supriya-raghavendra,4,"A light hearted read with relatable anecdotes and plenty of humour. The book talks about how to spend and not spend money, common flaws while thinking about money, the ways in which we creatively rationalize our stupid financial decisions and finally, some advice on how to use dollars and our sense more wisely.A must read for young folks who are beginning to deal with disposable income.

19,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14551209-dan-connors,4,"As a CPA, I try and read at least a few financial books per year. Many of the financial books today are unappealing to me, though I do have a weakness for Suzy Orman. This book, which came out in 2017, gives an alternative look at the way we think about money- mainly the irrational mistakes that our brains make when thinking about such an important and sensitive subject.Dan Ariely is a psychologist and writer, and I loved his book, Predictably Irrational. This one covers much of the same ground, but is completely oriented towards money and the mistakes we make thinking about it. The audiobook version is narrated by a gentleman with a thick British accent, which I found distracting at first, but he adds some humor and emphasis to some of the more absurd findings, like that over 40% of financial planners don't have a financial plan of their own.Some key findings:Paying for things is inherently painful, triggering responses in the brain. People who want your money are getting smarter and smarter about hiding and postponing that pain, including such things as credit cards, automatic payments, Apple Pay and more. To control your spending, the authors recommend feeling the pain more readily, paying in cash or check directly.Anchoring is the depressing phenomenon that when we don't have much knowledge about what a price should be, high numbers, even random numbers, can ""anchor"" our brain so that other numbers seem fair in comparison. Anchor numbers, such as suggested retail prices, are garbage, as are most sales prices. You should buy something because it fits your budget and answers your needs, period. Whether it's a good bargain is immaterial.The IKEA effect and the endowment effect are blinding biases that make us think that everything we touch or own is better because it's ours. Even taking a test drive or putting on a dress triggers this effect to such a point that we can't think objectively.We expect to see lots of effort from people who provide us services, even if that effort is wasted and incompetent. As a tax pro this one hit home because folks see how quickly I can find tax answers and think I'm overpaid, while it took me years and years of practice to get there. We expect prices to be fair based on the outer appearances we observe.We don't save for the future often because of a present bias. This isn't news, but the extent to which we discount the future still amazes me. It's a struggle we can all identify with.The solution to all this temptation and irrationality is to control your environment, getting rid of opportunities to make bad decisions as much as possible. They mention the Ulysses contract, taken from the ancient story where Ulysses bound himself to his own ship so he couldn't be tempted by the sirens who wanted to kill him. In such a contract, you lock up your money or your ability to get at it, and bad decisions aren't even on the table because you don't have the ability to give in to temptations.Great book- food for thought- four of five stars."
20,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58019001-roy-wang,4,"Although many of the book's key notions are recycled from Dan Ariely's previous works (e.g. Predictably Irrational), the authors' witty, sometimes self-deprecating writing makes it hard to put down the book, all the while chuckling at our own money mistakes. The fact that it's real money at stake makes it all the more incredible (and amusing?) to see the self-deceptions, mental loops, and shenanigans we humans routinely commit to just to avoid pain and uncertainty or protect our ego.Most important of all, companies are well aware of consumers' cognitive fallacies and more than happy to make us pay more than a perfectly rational being would. Therefore, do yourself a favor and at least be a more informed consumer by reading this book! P.S. Those who don't have enough time to read from the beginning can go straight to chapter 14 for a quick summary."
21,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5902412-matias-kewe,0,"Key takeaways:Money can be thought about in absolute or relative terms. We 'short change' ourselves when we compartmentalise our expenses, effectively thinking about money in relative as opposed to absolute value.Money is fungible, that is any $10 note is as valuable as any other $10.We are likely to value our possessions more than others do, or more than the market thinks that item or service is worth.We are susceptible to price anchoring, irrespective of the reference. All the more when other markers of quality are absent.Ritual and anticipation increase the value of an item or experience. Think pre-booking a holiday, laybying an item or swirling a glass of wine around an expensive wine glass prior to consuming it. Similarly, paying for an item or experience after we've consumed it can leave a negative lasting impression."
22,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36651447-will-simpson,5,"I thought I was a conscientious spend and saver but Dan and Jeff showed me where I’ve fooled myself and sometimes been lead astray in my financial decision making. Through many examples they show where we can slip and not act in our own best interest. They do not want to foster guilt on particular financial decisions but instead hope to show where creating a helpful space to consider options, opportunity cost, future self, long term goals - is in our own best interests. I love and follow Dan’s work in behavioral economics and Jeff is sort of a comedian and the combo is golden. This book makes a otherwise heavy subject light and in parts very funny. The humor makes the advice easy to swallow. I learn a lot and now I want to apply these lessons hopefully without being snobbish or prudish. "
23,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,2,"How are our brains fooled by money and how is our behavior manipulated by money. I thought that would be an interesting subject to dive in and this book by Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreislerr got some praise on the internet so I gave it a shot. I made 2 mistakes.1) I bought the Dutch translation. And the translation is not good. The humor conveys poorly and the translator did no effort to link the Amercanisms in the book to Dutchisms. In general, the Dutch do not work a lot with dollars and creditcards in their daily life, and their lifes differ at many details. So seeing these American habits written in a presumely Dutch environment alienated me from the content. 2) Apparently, the book was co-written with a stand-up comedian. Most chapters start with a short story describing how weird we can react when money is involved, and then the authors address the reader in the ""we"" form with attempts to humor. Did this work? Hell no, it annoyed the hell out of me. The content (phycological effect money has on behavior) became significantly diluted with hypothetical stories and stupid annoying ""jokes"". Finally, the book describes for 90% the behavior. Not the stuff I was after (and advertised on the cover): how to use the phycology of money to your own benefit. Just skip to Chapter 14, where the previous chapters are summarized. Then the chapters after give tips. And it all boils down to: ""think before you spend"". 2 stars, max."

Still worth a read because it does the same as his book on honesty/dishonesty...it points to how our human condition of intuitions, heuristics, subjective beliefs, rationalizations, and emotions subject us to being erroneous when it comes to money and value. I found myself realizing how much I get wrong even when I think I'm being objective and smart. For people who enjoy popular application of psychology/sociology, you'll enjoy this book and find humor with his intentionally funny but realistic anecdotes and examples. Ironically, I spent smarter on this book since it was a library loaner. ;-)"

In home also, money remains a taboo subject. I believe this belongs in a group of books that provides real education on personal finance, helps us to make better decisions by making small changes in the way we think.

Why? Ariely tried to explain the rationale that is responsible for those apparently irrational decisions."

Value reflects the worth of something, what we might be willing to pay for a product or service. In essence, value should mirror opportunity cost. It should accurately reflect what we're willing to give up in order to acquire an item or experience. And we should spend our money according to the actual value of different options."" ""We have always assessed valued in ways that are not necessarily connected to value at all."" ""Happiness too often seems to be less a reflection of our actual happiness and more a reflection of the ways in which we compare ourselves to others."" ""In some ways, the concept of regret is itself just another version of comparison. With regret, we compare ourselves- our lives, our careers, our wealth, our status- not to other people, but to alternative versions of ourselves. We compare ourselves to the selves we might have been, had we made different choices. This too, is often neither healthy nor useful."" ""Emotional Accounting. Emotional money laundering can take many forms. We might cleanse badly tainted money by first spending it on serious things like paying down debt, or on virtuous ones, like buying ice cream- for an orphanage. We we do something we think is good, it eliminates the bad feelings associated with the money, making us free to spend.This type of emotional money laundering is certainly not rational, but it makes us feel good.""""Malleable mental accounting.

We manipulate our mental accounts to justify our spending, allowing us the luxury of overspending and feeling good about it."" ""The end of an experience is very important. Think of closing prayers at religious services, dessert at the end of a meal, or goodbye songs at the end of summer camp. Ending on a high note is important because the end of an experience informs and shapes how we reflect back on, remember, and value the entire experience.

The second factor is the attention we give to the payment itself. The formula is: pain of paying = time + attention. "" ""These 'advances' certainly make paying easier. Frictionless. Painless. Thoughtless. If we don't even know something's happening, how can we feel it? How can we understand the consequences? """"Herding and Self-Herding. Herding is the idea that we will go with the crowd, that we assume something is good or bad based upon other people's behavior. If other people like it, or review it well, or beg to see it, do it, or pay for it, we'll be convinced it's good. We assume something is of high value because others appear to value it highly. (ie: yelp). Self-herding is the second, more dangerous part of anchoring. Self- herding is the same fundamental idea as herding, except that we base our decisions not on those of other people, but on similar decisions we ourselves have made in the past. We assume something has high value because we valued it highly before. We value something at what it 'normally' or has 'always' cost, because we trust ourselves with our own behaviors. We remember that we've made a specific value decision over and over, so without spending the time and energy to evaluate that decision over and over, we assume it was a good one."" "" People like Gregg Rapp, a restaurant consultant, say the highest- priced items actually generate revenue by getting people to buy the second - highest priced items. This is decoy pricing using anchoring and relativity."" ""The less we know about something, the more we depend on anchors."" ""An anchor price can be any figure, no matter how random, so long as we associate it with a decision. That decision gains power and influences our future decisions moving forward. Anchoring shows the importance of early decisions about pricing, that they establish a value in our heads and affect our own value calculations going forward."" "" Anchors gain their long-term impact with a process called ARBITRARY COHERENCE. The basic idea is that, while the amount that participants were willing to pay for any item was largely influenced by the random anchor, once they came up with a price for a product category, that price students in the above experiment were asked to bid on two products within a category 2 wines an 2 computer accessories. Did the decision about the first (wine or keyboard) affect the second in the same category? The answer is yes. "" ""Endowment effect is deeply connected to Loss aversion. The principle of loss aversion, first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, holds that we value gains and losses differently. We feel the pain of losses more strongly than we do the same magnitude of pleasure. And it's not just a small difference- it's about 2x."" ""Imagine that right now you were not married to this person, and you knew about her everything you now know, but you've just been friends for the last 10 years. Would you now propose to her?"" ""How much of his conflict came from thinking about the past, from overvaluing the time and energy he'd already sunk into his marriage, rather than looking forward, to the time and energy he'd use in the future, regardless of the previous investment?"" ""Ownership changes our perspective. We adjust to our level of ownership and it becomes the baseline by which we judge gains and losses.One way to overcome the traps of ownership is to try to separate ourselves psychologically from the things that we own, in order to more accurately assess their value. We should think abut where we are now and what will happen going forward, not where we came from.This is of course, much easier said than done, especially when we tend to put so much emotion, time, and money into our lives and into our possessions- our homes, our investments, and our relationships.""""Language can shape how we frame our experiences. Language can make us pay extra attention to what we consume and direct our attention to specific parts of the experience. It can help us appreciate our experiences more than we might otherwise. "" "" The physical thing itself hasn't changed, but our experience of it has and so has our willingness to pay for it. Language is not just describing the world around us, it influences what we pay attention to, what we end up enjoying and what we don't."" ""This use of language creates what author John Lanchester calls 'priesthoods' - using elaborate ritual and language that is designed to bamboozle, mystify, and intimidate, leaving us with a feeling that we are not sure what's being talked about but that as long as we use the service of these qualified people we will be in expert hands."" ""Rituals connect a single experience to many other past and future experiences just like it. That connection gives the experience extra meaning by causing it to become part of a tradition that extends back to the past and forward into the future."" ""Rituals make food seem tastier, events seem special-er, and life seem life-ier. They make experiences feel more valuable. Like consumption vocabulary, rituals make us stop and focus on what we're doing. They enhance our enjoyment of consumption because they give us greater involvement in that consumption. But rituals go a step beyond consumption vocabulary because they also involve some activity on our part, and they also involve meaning. In the process they can enhance almost any experience."" ""The difference between our choice about now and our choice about the future is simply that decisions made in the present involve emotion, whereas decisions made about the future do not. """"Money is a curse and a blessing. It's a wonderful thing to have money as a medium for exchange, but as we've learned, it often misdirects us and influences us to focus on the wrong things. For an antidote, a bit of moneyless reframing helps from time to time. Consider the underlying trade-offs between things and other things instead of between things and money. If you're happy with the trade-off go for it. If you're not, think again, and again. And again. No matter our station in life, we believe it is important that instead of thinking about life decisions in terms of money, we think about them in terms of life."" ""When it comes to making financial decisions, what should matter are opportunity costs, the true benefit a purchase provides, and the real pleasure we receive from it compared to other ways we could spend our money. What should NOT matter in a perfectly rational world? -Sale prices or 'savings' or how much we're spending at the same time on something else (relativity) -Classification of our money, where it came from, and how we feel about it (mental accounting) -Ease of Payment (pain of paying) -First price we see or previous prices we've paid for a purchase (anchoring) -Sense of ownership (endowment effect and loss aversion) -Whether we give in to the temptations of the present (self-control) -Ease of comparing the price of a product, experience or widget. Remember: those things do not affect the value of a purchase (even if we think they do) there are other factors that would not change value if we were perfectly rational, but since we are full of quirks, they end up changing the value of our experiences. These include: -words describing something and what we do at the time of consumption (language and rituals) -How we anticipate the consumption experience, rather than what its true nature is (expectations) "" ""Remember, our lack of self-control is due to discounting the future - because we are not emotionally attached to it- and to our willpower's failure to overcome the temptations of the present. So how can we increase self- control? By connecting to our future and resisting temptation.""""Use simple tools to help us imagine our future self more vividly, specifically, and relata""bly. It can be as simple as having an imaginary conversation with an older 'us'. Or we can write a letter to an elderly version of ourselves. We can also simply think about what our specific needs, desires, greatest joys, and toughest regrets will be when we're 65, 70, 95, 100. "" ""The struggle to improve our financial decision-making isn't just a struggle against our personal flaws; it's also against systems designed to exacerbate those flows and take advantage of our shortcomings. Consequently, we must fight harder. We must individually adapt our thought processes to think more wisely about how we spend our money. And, as a society (assuming we want the people around us to make better money decisions), we must also design systems to be compatible with how we think about money so that our choices benefit us, and society, not those who might exploit and abuse our flawed thinking.""

41,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93798295-laurencia,5,"Another superb book by Dan Ariely - such a perfect blend of logic and humor! This book is worth every penny, in fact, it'll actually help you to save your pennies! I finally learnt how to save and no longer live from paycheck to paycheck (my girlfriend can attest to that)This book made so much cents that I'm going to read it again!"
42,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14718038-alex-west,4,"This is behavioural economics, presented in language and with examples that makes it readable by pretty much anyone. No one even mentions 'heuristic' until we're almost fifty pages in. If you are unfamiliar with the subject, you will spend a lot of this book thinking, 'Oh wow, I DO that. I did that just the other day.' Even as someone who recognised many of the basic concepts, I still enjoyed how the authors made me more aware of how these behaviours were manifesting in everyday life, and their dry, Seinfeld-esque humour was (apart from one somewhat overwrought joke about a dominatrix) genuinely entertaining.This is not a guide to investing or a how-to guide to managing your money. Rather, it's a guide to the psychology of money, and why many of your choices are predictably irrational. It is the hope of the authors that by becoming aware of the ways in which you're likely to behave irrationally, you can out in place safeguards not only to minimise your risks of being stupid with money, but also to maximise the pleasure you get out of money.The second aspect I found really intriguing, because I hadn't thought about this as much before, and I can see how you can do a lot with it. For example, I have previously tried to increase the pain of paying by creating a separate account for discretionary spending and to make it easy to check on my phone, and to check it after each transaction. This is not a bad strategy. But what I hadn't considered was how I could increase the joy of a reward by detaching it from the pain of paying by pre-paying well in advance. I had never been able to work out why I have enjoyed some of my holidays much more than others, but this explained it. The holidays I've really enjoyed have effectively been paid for up front, either literally paid for, or I have spent some time prior to the holiday allocating money into a separate 'holiday' account, where mentally the money has already been spent. The holidays I haven't enjoyed so much have been the ones where I failed to do this, so that about half-way through I had to start working out whether I had enough money to do things. Instead of relaxing, I was researching costs, scrutinising my bank balance, feeling guilty, and second-guessing my choices. This has actually changed what should have been some great holidays (or parts of holidays) into experiences that I almost regretted. I had paid up front, and put money in a separate account, solely for the purpose of making sure I had sufficient money for the holiday. In my head, it was just being sensible and dutiful and budgeting. Even though I was vaguely aware I wasn't worried about money during the good holidays, I didn't connect how much this actually increased the pleasure I later got out of the holiday. A part of me (a small part, swiftly silenced) just worried that perhaps I was being a bit irresponsible by not thinking about it. Really big holidays are expensive things, and if I spend that much money, it's worth a lot to me to plan to do it in a way I will relax and enjoy it.Other parts of the book showed me why some strategies I have adopted seem to actually be helping. For example, a month ago I spent a few days devoted to the sexy task of drawing up a plan on Excel for paying down my mortgage. This involved a lot of tinkering with numbers and different scenarios, where I thought carefully about exactly when I would need to replace my car, looked up possible cars on Red Book, considered the impact of taking holidays and making different lifestyle choices. While the eventual plan is only about a page, the whole exercise involved extensive visualisation of precise futures and different opportunity costs. I mapped different milestones in the mortgage against my future age and my daughter's future age, which meant I was writing ages next to both our names that were somewhat alarming and uncomfortable to visualise. I printed the plan and stuck it on my fridge where I see it each day, where to everyone else it looks like a bunch of unexciting and cryptic numbers. I then spent some hours my daughter probably wishes she had back explaining the plan to her and its real-world implications (a treat night will be a cheap pizza and Netflix rather than going to a restaurant, we will next take an amazing trip in exactly 4 years, and when she finishes school I will be in a position to support her to go to uni etc.) In my diary, I have estimated how much further I will have paid down my mortgage if stick to the plan at the end of each month, and have written a dollar figure there as a reference. The amount in a mortgage account has so many numbers that it's hard to notice whether it's moving at all, in percentage terms additional payments barely seem to be doing anything. The net effect of all these strategies is that I am finding it much easier to rein in my discretionary spending, because I am so aware of what I am giving up if I don't. Now I can see this is because I have found ways to get in touch with my future self, to avoid the trick of percentages and use concrete figures, and in doing all this to accurately visualise the opportunity cost of any further discretionary spending. While doing the maths was obviously important, I can see now that all the visualisation of the future that went along with the maths was equally important. Had someone else simply done the maths for me and handed me a plan to stick to, I would equally have the plan, but I wouldn't be making the same sensible choices on a day-to-day basis because the fruits of the plan would still feel hypothetical and of little relevance to the present. They would be unlikely to spring to mind when I was actually shopping.Another interesting point to mull over has been relativity and the value of free. I haven't made this work for me before, but lately I have made some choices that leverage this. For example, I used to have a Kindle, where all content had to be purchased from Amazon. I recently lost the Kindle. I then had to choose whether I replaced it (for about $200) or bought an equivalent Kobo (for about $350). I decided to choose the Kobo - it cost more but I can borrow books for free from the library. Now, obviously, buying the equipment is not free, and I only did it after I calculated whether it would work out better than hire / service fees over time, taking into account how much I used such things. Based on how many ebooks I buy, I reasoned I would probably make back the extra cost of the Kobo over about a year. I was, however, slightly nervous, because I tend to buy obscure books rather than 'airport fiction' and wondered how much I would enjoy the content of my local library.Here's how it worked out.When I got the Kobo, I was so used to buying books on Amazon that I hardly thought about how much money they were. Now I am used to being able to download ebooks from the library for free, I am reluctant to pay for any books. I'd rather choose from what's in the library than pay. This has actually cut down my spending and increased my reading more than what I anticipated, and without the pain of paying I actually enjoy reading a lot more than I'd come to with the Kindle. It's worked out as a much, much better choice because I am reading more (which, separately, was a New Years resolution of mine) and can afford to do so. In fact, I realise the reason I stopped reading airport fiction was that I always felt it was overpriced for what it was, and I hated the pain of paying. Now that those books are free, they have returned to being enjoyable for me. The reason I bought obscure books was in part because their specialised content to me justified the price-tag. Often I didn't enjoy these books as much, and often they sat on my Kindle barely-read. By contrast, I am reading most of what I download on the Kobo, and if I start a book and don't like it, I simply virtually 'return' it, guilt free. I don't buy extra books because I am interested in a topic and don't know which one will be best, and so figure I better load up my Kindle with a few just in case.But wait, there's more! The cost of a movie used to seem relatively trivial - it's the same as the cost of a couple of ebooks. Now that ebooks are (or seem) free, the cost of a movie seems relatively enormous. Do I really want to spend that much just for two hours of (possible) enjoyment? I could read a free book and at the end instead of feeling (possibly) disappointed and annoyed I could have spent the money on other things, I will feel good about myself. This is turn has helped me spend less money overall.Anyway, to sum up I found this book very useful and applicable. It was also an entertaining read. I think, however, that it would have benefited from more examples of how people have applied strategies in different, clever ways."

It also gave me a new perspective about money, by first pointing out the omnipresence of money in our lives and how we can rise above our human nature to coexist with it, in turn getting the best value out of this life.

Dan Ariely is, of course, best know for his seminal book on psychology Predictably Irrational.This book explores some of the most common mistakes made when it comes to money and the reasons behind those mistakes. For example: why are we willing to spend more on the same item when on a vacation than at home? Why do we feel it is ok to spend money on options when buying a car when that money is substantial in its own right? Why do we over spend when using a credit card or a digital wallet than when paying with cash? Why do we think Uber’s surge pricing is unfair when local cab companies charge a lot more as their base price?What does this book cover?Dollars and Sense has three parts.The first part discusses basic monetary concepts. The second part (and the longest) discusses all the psychological traps and behavioral quirks that make us unwise when it comes to fiscal sense. We also get to see the reasons behind these behaviors. The third part talks about how to be better at managing money given that we know what to watch out for.Some of the quirks addressed in the book are as follows- Relativity (the myth of ‘sales’ or how much we are spending at the same time on something else)- Mental Accounting (classifying money into buckets)- Pain of Paying (The ease of payment makes it easy to over spend)- Anchoring (The first price we see or previous prices we have paid for a purchase)- Endowment Effect and Loss Aversion (our sense of ownership makes us think that what we own is more precious)Read the full review at my site Digital Amrit"

46,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37464559-rosa,3,"Are you a saver or a spender?A Spender!Emotional? Compulsive? Unnecessary spending?Or:A saver!You are out of the hook if you save without spending money. Otherwise, you can benefit from these ideas too.How do you curb your spending habits? According to Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler, authors of Dollars and Sense: How We Misthink Money and How to Spend Smarter, “We’ve seen how we think about money incorrectly, how we assess value in ways that have little to do with actual value, and how these get us to misthink and misspend our money.”Once you change your mindset, spot your spending triggers and budget busters, you can stop them and get your finances back on track.  HOW TO STOP MAKING BAD CHOICES ABOUT MONEY Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler explain why we make foolish money decisions through these common mistakes to avoid. In the end, you’ll spend your money wisely, and improve your financial situation. 1.- We ignore opportunity costs Opportunity costs are present anytime we buy something, even if we are unaware.“Opportunity costs are alternatives. They are the things that we give away, now or later, in order to do something.”Mostly, we think about opportunity costs before we make important purchases, for example, buying a house. However, the problem lays in the choices we make every day.We don’t realize what we give up when we buy something, sometimes we don’t even need. “For instance, we can translate dollars into time—how many hours of wages, or months of salary, we must work to pay for something.”Moreover, we could add to our savings to buy the house if we give up buying things that we don’t need, just because they are on sale.2.- We forget that everything is relative We need a context to measure value of goods and services. But, in our attempt to make the right choices, we compare items, and that creates a relative value.However, if we don’t consider the opportunity costs—only compare the item to one or two alternatives—the relative value works against us. Don’t use sale signs to provide context To consider buying something with a special offer or discount, we shouldn’t take into account the regular price, or how much we’re saving.We should consider what we spend. For example, if you bought a $100 shirt at 40% off, you didn’t save $40, instead, you spent $60.Right: Compare $60 to $0, or the alternatives-opportunity costs- items you could buy for $60.Wrong: Compare $60 to $100, and think you saved $40. Try not to think in percentages “When relativity comes into play, we can find ourselves making quick decisions about large purchases and slow decisions about small ones, all because we think about the percentage of total spending, not the actual amount.”For example, at a car dealership, a customer bought a car for $25,000, and an add-on (a CD changer) for $200.The customer accepted because the 0.8 per cent of the total purchase price seemed no big deal.On the other hand, the same customer who didn’t give a second thought to $200 on an additional purchase on a $25,000 car “might use a discount voucher to save 25 cents on a bag of crisps or debate about a dollar or two tip at a restaurant.” 3.- We compartmentalize Mental accounting, a tool used for budgeting, is “another way we think about money that has little to do with actual value. Mental accounting can be an useful tool, but it often leads to poor decision-making, especially when we’re unaware we are even using it at all.”The problem: We categorize our money the wrong way. We divide our money into different mental accounts, with different rules, depending on:How we get it.How we spend it.How it makes us feel.For example: if we receive a gift card, probably, it goes to our entertainment mental account. With the gift card, we buy things that otherwise we’ll never buy with our hard-earned money.In the end, it doesn’t matter where the money comes from “If we find ourselves splurging with certain “kinds” of money—just because in our mind the money belongs to the “bonuses” or “winnings” account—we need to pause, think, and remind ourselves that it’s just money. Our money.”Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler conclude that “relativity and our inclination to make the easy choice leave us susceptible to multiple types of external interventions and manipulations by those who set the prices, including decoys.”It’s our responsibility to take charge of our finances. It’s essencial to educate ourselves to avoid mistakes, and make choices now that we won’t regret later.The post How to Stop Making Foolish Money Decisions – Three common mistakes to avoid appeared first on rosaelenad.com"

I am not going to start rituals to increase enjoyment of anything.Notes* The objective worth of anything can be extremely hard to value, so people use many heuristics, which are mental shortcuts.* Anchoring is one heuristic. When exposed to a number, which can be as irrelevant as a SSN, people use it as a starting point for an estimate, such as an estimate of value or price. However, adjustment from the anchor can be insufficient. Retailers do this intentionally by having so-called ""regular prices"" or MSRPs even when the item is always discounted. Forget any prior or original prices, and focus on the current, final cost.* Watch out for decoys: the high-priced items, such as on a restaurant menu, designed to make medium-priced options seem more reasonable.* Paying can be painful. Some ways of paying, such as credit cards, are less painful and can contribute to overspending. Use cash when you want to reduce spending because it makes the amount salient.* Consider money in absolute instead of relative terms. For example, when buying a $20 thousand dollar car, a 1% increase for a CD-change should be considered as $200 instead of as 1%. Also, un-bundle decisions: would you spend $200 on a CD changer after you bought the car?* People over-value free. For example, if you often use a mobile app, maybe it is worth upgrading to the $4.99 paid version, even if there is a worse, free version.* People commit self-herding. They validate a current decision based on whether they did it before, but be mindful. For example, is it worth buying a $4 coffee every day? That is $1460 per year.* People use mental accounts which violate the fungibility of money, but it helps people deal with the complexity.* When buying something, say a $3000 vacation, consider the opportunity cost, such as how many dinner-movie dates that would buy.* People overvalue a thing when they own it (endowment effect) or put effort into it (the IKEA effect).* A ritual can make something more valuable or pleasurable.* Language can change the perceived value of something. For example, the equivalent choice can be framed as a gain or loss: such as paying (saving) more with surge (non-surge) pricing on Uber.* People pay for incompetence: we rather pay more for a novice locksmith to spend an hour fiddling and breaking a lock. When an expert opens it in two minutes, it feels like a rip off.* People overspend and under-save because of a present-focused bias. To help save more, imagine your older self in detail.* Control your environment to limit temptations. Make a Ulysses contract.* When a choice has many dimensions (such as for a vehicle: MPG, safety rating, color, number of seats), price is often used as an easy way to compare options and irrationally serves as a proxy for overall value. In other words, if it is expensive, it must be good."
48,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,5,"Found this book through another Dayrean's review and since I enjoyed Dan Ariely’s other books, I thought I’d give it a go!Dollars and Sense is a personal finance book, only instead of telling you what to do, the book shows you the financial mistakes you’ve been making and explains why. The first part of the book covers what money is (foundation) and the second, longest, part covers the not-so-rational ways we think about money, such as:- Relative prices (we’re tempted to buy when we think that we’re saving something even when we’re not)- Mental accounting (we categorise the ways we spend money which leads to not so prudent financial decisions- The Pain of Paying (so we value potential loses more than potential gains)- Anchoring (basing valuation on the first number we see)- Ownership (if we can see it as ours, we value it higher)- Whether we think the price is fair (to us and for the effort we see exerted)- Whether we can restrain ourselves in the present for the sake of the future- Overemphasising money- Fancy language and rituals making us value a product more- Expecting a certain experience vs the actual experience and how that affects our value of it.After going through all these ‘bad’ thinking habits we have, the book ends on a hopeful note: by offering us strategies we can use. Of course, awareness plays a huge role in helping to avoid such behaviour, but other things we can do is to visualise the future as a concrete thing (save for a specific retirement date, e.g. Dec 1 2050, instead of a vague X years in the future), make good financial habits (like savings) opt out rather than opt in, and other strategies.I found this book to be very educational and very entertaining! It’s actually co-written by Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler; since one of Kreisler’s ‘jobs’ is comedian, it explains the copious amounts of humour in this book. The chapters all focus on one, perhaps two ideas, and are explained using stories that are buffeted by studies.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to change the way they think about money. Like another one of Ariely’s books say, we humans are ‘predictably irrational’. That means that we can anticipate certain habits and change them for the better.This review was first posted at Inside the mind of a Bibliophile"
49,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13106364-brett-whysel,4,"Dollars and Sense is an enjoyable, non-technical overview of some of the ways we make bad money decisions and a few ways we can get better. One of the authors is a comedian (with a middle-aged white-guy sensibility), which at times provided a chuckle and other times, groans. The other is a well-known behavioral economist who has written extensively about how predictably irrational we can be. The authors seem to share my worry that companies, especially technology companies, are getting increasing good at manipulating us so that they can encourage and profit off our mistakes.Here some of the more important take-aways:(view spoiler)[	• We should ignore whether something is on sale and focus on the final price. 	• We should consider what else we could spend the money on (the opportunity cost).	• Emotional accounting: we will ""launder"" money received under bad circumstances e.g. dishonestly by donating a portion to charity	• We experience paying for things literally as a pain, which registers in brain scans. Companies do all they can to reduce the pain of paying, often to our detirment.	• Anchoring is most effective when we don't know the value of something. ""We cling to any starting point."" 	• I especially enjoyed the chapter on the endowment effect (chapter 8). The authors explain, *we value what we own more highly because we focus more on its positive attributes"" This is why free trials are so effective.	• We consider fairness in the prices we are willing to pay, especially with respect to effort. Sometimes, this is irrelevant.	• ""Consumption vocabulary"" e.g. ""bouquet"" and ""nose"" and ""legs"" can help us appreciate an experience better and value it more highly. 	• The authors note that one quarter of 50-64 year olds have saved nothing for retirement. We are biased to the present because the future has less emotion for us and we imagine our future selves to be entirely different people.  (hide spoiler)]In sum, the authors exhort us to ""stop and think"". This is clearly good advice, especially for important financial decision that happen rarely and for smaller decisions that happen frequently, whose effects can add up. It's clearly helpful to be aware of our weaknesses and how business (and I daresay governments) can exploit them. I recommend this book."
50,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6944024-maynard-handley,2,"I've enjoyed everything Dan Ariely has written so far, but this did nothing for me. (a) It feels like a rehash of his previous work (together with other stuff you'll know if you've read, eg Amos Tversky), just packaged around a different central concept; but there isn't enough new material here, IMHO, to justify time spent reading it.(b) Perhaps I'm a very different sort of human being, but the pathologies and irrationalities described in the text mostly don't match my life and thinking, and I have to wonder the extent to which they are less human universals than the result of growing in a wealthy, secure, society of plenty. I certainly don't claim that I am absolutely rational regarding money, but I have rather different silly behavior from the various categories described in the text, the pathologies of poverty rather than of wealth. (So an irrational desire to hold onto things that might, one day in ten years, prove useful. Or an unwillingness to buy a much better version of something [eg to replace a 10 yr old computer] because the old one still works, sorta, and to throw it away would be wasteful [and you can't really sell it because it's ten years old and some features are broken]. You can tell you are in such a pathological situation if, when something breaks, your feeling is relief; ""Thank God I can now throw it away without guilt""; rather than sadness that you will have to pay to replace it.)I suspect people working in this field need to reduce the number of experiments on ""average"" US college students and start doing more experiments on different categories of people, eg people who grew up very wealthy but have since been forced to live poor, and the reverse; or people from cultures that put much more stress than most US cultures on deferred gratification, or not wasting things, or frowning on conspicuous consumption. (c) Dan's books are written in a pleasantly humorous style, but this book comes with a co-author, and I think the co-author ramps up the level of jocularity beyond what I can really stand. Maybe others will like the tone, but I found it grating after the first chapter. "
51,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19581957-tim-johnson,3,"Reading this book ruined my marriage.Well, not really, but it did lead my wife and I into a lukewarm debate about the word “artisanal” in the context of sharp white cheddar. I disagreed with her (and Ariely/Kreisler) and said that the artisanal definitely tasted different than the block extra sharp white cheddar. Naturally, the only way to resolve this is with a blind taste test. Ironically, we could both tell the difference between the cheeses but she persisted in her belief in the superiority of the block version. There’s no accounting for taste I guess. I mean, she married me right?The essence of Dollars and Sense is that we are really bad at valuation. I mean really bad. The first thing we do is look for a point of comparison, usually the easiest one we can find: price. Sometimes we look for a similar item or a past purchase or even the previous price for the exact item we’re looking at. The more options in the mix, the worse we are at it. We overvalue things that don’t matter and entire industries have been invented to take advantage of our shortcomings.Ariely and Kreisler want us all to evaluate our major purchases in terms of what we give up to obtain it (opportunity cost). But let’s flip this on its head: what would happen to the economy if everybody just started saving responsibly?Didn’t think about that, did you guys? So much of our economy is smoke and mirrors, a house of cards. However you look at it. We need jobs to make money to spend on stuff that other people made that will break so that we have to work more hours to buy another one that will become obsolete in two years so that we again have to charge another one to our credit card. And on and on and on.Just like the market needs both hedgers and betters, the economy needs both savers and spenders. The main difference between the two is that the spenders have a lot of fun when they are young but have to work into their 80’s whereas the savers will get to have more fun in their golden years.That’s about all I have for this book at the moment. I am off to see my if wife is influenced more by wine in a plastic cup or in a crystal goblet. "
52,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,5,"A must read, especially for audio. The narrator was great for this book. He's British and did nice satirical tones. Some of the material was a little repetitive towards the end but most people need to hear this stuff twice and even three times. Some silly things we do: go on a $10,000 vacation and spend 20 minutes looking for free parking. Or spend a fortune at a nice hotel and buy an expensive drink even though you can get a cheaper drink next door.You know, the Buddhist and his followers should be very happy because so many people are living in the now and not even thinking about the future, financially. About 16% of NFL players file for bankruptcy. About 68% of NBA players are in financial trouble within five years.Notes:Whenever money is added to any decision it becomes a lot more complex. The opportunity cost of money is when we spend money on one thing. Its money that we cannot spend on anything else now or in the future.Rationally, money = opportunity costs = value. Bargains make us feel special and smart. They make us believe we're finding value where others haven't. Relativity and pricing is often the easy choice but not often the wisest choice. When something is on sale it's easier to buy that product than the same product at the same price not on sale; we need to find the products absolute value first. I've been doing that since I got married and now grocery shop on a regular basis. I have a general idea of how much I should pay for certain items. It's fun when that happens. I feel like I'm working the system and not being an idiot.Relativity leaks into every aspect of our lives. Happiness is less of a reflection of our actual happiness and more of a reflection in which the ways we compare ourselves to others. In some ways regret is just another version of comparison We compare ourselves to how something should have been in our lives had we made different choices. Pain of spending money stimulates the same area of our brain as does physical pain. It's easier to spend a gift card then it is real money because it feels like payment has already been made. The separation of payment and when you actually use what you've paid is what makes you spend more money because it feels painless like it's already paid for or that it's free. You feel better consuming things that you've already paid for in advance. This pain of simultaneously paying or using the product isn't necessarily bad but it just makes you acutely aware of your payment. That's why I love flying because I spent money months in advance for the ticket.Research shows just a suggestion of credit cards like its logo induces people to spend. The highest priced item generate revenue by getting people to buy the second highest priced item. I need to be aware of this. When there is a market price for something we pay that price (the anchor price). An anchor price can be any number no matter how random so long as we associate it with a decision. That decision gains power and influences our further decisions moving forward. There is no market price for smelling shoes so if you ask a 100 different people what they'd spend to smell shoes you will get prices all over the place.Steve Jobs had to make an anchor when he introduced the iPad because it was the first of its kind (even though there were tablets long before the iPad, shame on you Dan, do your research) and Steve did an anchor of $1,000 because people said that that's what they would pay for it and then cut that in half as the real payment so he could still get more money out of us because he established that anchor. What a hero you are Steve. Not.The endowment effect is the idea that we value something higher simply because we own it. The endowment effect is similar to loss aversion that Daniel Kaneman came up with - you value gains and losses differently. You feel the pain of a loss stronger than you do the magnitude of pleasure. The pain of losing $10 is stronger than winning $10. Yes it is. People don't like contributing to their retirement accounts because it feels like they're giving up something that they can have now. Your loss if this is you.The cell phone approach is known as aggregating losses and segregating gains and it plays on loss aversion giving us one painful loss and several pleasurable gains. Infomercials do this too by their multiple uses device and one small payment. The harder it is to create something the more ownership and love we have towards it. This is called the Ikea effect. Similarly, people want items more when they have them in the hands. Companies do this by giving out a trial offer that gives you a sense of ownership. We consider something more valuable for having used it. The principle of fairness changes our perception of value. We discount things that are unfair. Things that are fair or unfair is largely about effort. Like upselling an umbrella during a rainstorm. It doesn't require any more effort to produce or sell so it shouldn't cost more. It's unfair. But the principle of supply and demand agree with this principle. Fairness is a function of effort and effort is shown through transparency. Language changes how we value good services and experiences of all kinds. It doesn't change the actual product itself but our perception of it is changed. This richer language shows that more effort has been put into the product. And we will pay top dollar for it (think of those dumb fancy wines that are so eloquently described, they're no better than what you can get at the gas station). This reminds me when Andy from the Office is trying to help Michael listen in on David Wallace's conversation with Jim and Andy describes the ""rare"" cheeses so eloquently. I'm sorry but there was no YouTube clip for which to indulge.Expectations help fill in our vision of the future. They also alter the events before it happens and while it's happening. So the real question is: do expectations help enhance or disappoint life's experiences?Before the theft of the Mona Lisa in 1911 it wasn't very popular but after it was stolen all of a sudden people wanted to see it because surely something that was stolen had to be valuable. Dumb Mona Lisa. I want to read Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions now but the dang lie bury doesn't have it on audio. 46% of financial planners don't have retirement accounts. I read this part right before going to meet with our financial adviser. Fortunately Rich (that's his name. Neat huh?) is a great guy and has retirement accounts."
53,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75865761-brat,2,"Dan Ariely is one of my favorite authors, and his book predictably irrational is one of my all time favorites. This is the book that introduced me to the concept of behavioral science and the study on why we behave the way we do, and what can be done to change that behavior has been an integral part of my life since. I still remember how the book captivated me during the holiday to Rishikesh with Ankana in the fall of 2015.With this admiration for the author’s skills, I picked up this book immediately after I got to know of it. One of my favorite authors, and the topic being personal finance were both in my interest areas and I wanted to read this book immediately.I think this burden of high expectations killed the joy, and I did not find the book great. It is a very basic book with examples filled from America on how we make money mistakes and what we can do better.The tone of the book is more like a blog than a book and that for a serious topic does not really help build the narrative.There are some useful gems spewed through the book, but too little too few, and all of them with no exception are with an American mindset. With this, the book does not seem relevant at many places, and I took an extraordinary one plus year to finish reading this book. It has been lying on the bottom most rack of the bathroom rack for long bearing dust and the humidity in the bathroom. I finally got to finish, or rather skim through the final parts of the book in Jan 2020 when I wanted to finish up all pending books/discard them, before I start any new book for the year. This is how I got to finish the book.This book makes a lot of sense for the uninitiated and if you are from America, all the more better, else stay away! "
54,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818257-mel,3,"Book is about spending behavior and psychology. It was a pleasant listen. Some may feel there is a lot of ""fillers"" and forced humor, but I think these help ease the journey of listening to the book ( especially for those like me who struggles with books that talks about money). It also became a redundant towards the end (around Part III) when they gave the conclusion chapters which summarizes pointers from every chapter, though I think it is intentional because some knowledge is retained better when it is repeatedly said. While the context of this book is money, I feel it could be applied to other aspects - like inclusion, diversity, social behaviors, but I digress.Pointers:1) We often mistake a purchase's true value and misuse relativity/ anchoring/ our memories/ confirmation bias to value it. Instead we should value each purchase by its (forgoing) opportunity cost and pleasures it bring.2) When compartmentalized the spending, it is easier to overspend (this is where budgets in portions may fail).3) We perceive an object we own higher than those we don't.4) We believe in spending fairness (i.e. fair price) but we forgot economic senses (supply vs demand) rather than human emotions that played a bigger role in the value. So, you ought to pick your fights.I heard the content is similar his other work Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. I wonder whether I should attempt that book as well. Thoughts?"
55,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119792077-steven-marks,5,"Dan Ariely is known for his psychology/behavioral economics books in the Predictably Irrational series. In this much more pragmatic book, he talks about ways people behave irrationally when it comes to money. By identifying these cognitive traps, he helps you avoid them, and instead make better decisions. This isn’t so much an investment guide - you can find tons of those of varying quality*. This is explaining how you should think about money in general, both so you will have more of it, and so you will be happier with respect to everything that involves money.I think Ariely is brilliant, and it absolutely is worth following his advice when it comes to money. It will make you better off financially, happier, and less stressed.* I’m not a financial adviser, but before I got into self-improvement, I went to Economics graduate school and was a high-level Accountant, so a couple of quick pieces of advice regarding investments, and investment guides/advisers: 1. Never buy an individual stock, unless it’s for fun with money you can afford to lose and you’re treating it like a trip to Vegas. Any adviser/book/guru/website that tells you to buy individual stocks is incompetent and not someone you should listen to. 2. Never buy actively managed mutual funds, because index funds are superior in every way. Any adviser who avoids telling you about index funds or tries to convince you to buy actively managed mutual funds instead is trying to line their own pockets with your money, and you should run away. (If you don’t know what index funds are, Ariely explains it in the book. Or any financial adviser can tell you. And if they can’t/won’t, find a different adviser.)"
56,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7299359-aparna,4,"Making irrational financial decisions is the hallmark of humanity and most of us do it unknowingly while complimenting ourselves at every stage about being ‘money wise’. The author leaves no stone unturned in describing the natural irrational streak which is an integral part of human behavior. The best part is without being preachy he gives a calibrated view of reality and explains incidents which go well beyond one’s spending habits.Some relatable examples like how pre paying for a trip could save the heartburn during the trip and enhance overall experience, to ‘pain of paying’ (our natural inclination is towards things which are free), the use of decoy by marketing companies to lure customers – takes the reader on self-introspection journey. Also, how expectations add colour to our emotions and anticipation of a good experience justifies the inflated costs, makes one realize the irrational exuberance which one tends to exhibit in the most mundane activities. That an Ulysses contract can be an extremely useful tool to circumvent temptation, is one the key takeaways which could be a remedy to combat the issue of self-control in difficult situations. While we may often say that money is not the important thing, nevertheless it holds paramount importance which is second to none. Anyone looking to understand and alter his/her psyche to tread on the path of rationality – this book could be instrumental in enriching their overall experience of lifetime goals."
57,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66195024-bonnie,2,"Humans make bad financial decisions because of emotions. This reality is very shocking 😒😒😒This book was a disappointment to me. I spent dollars for logic that makes no sense. One of the examples was the price of a $250 dollar car stereo. A consumer should compare the potential of $250 dollars to zero. Okay, I can try to follow here. The key word is TRY. What about the car title transfer? Should I compare THAT value to zero? What about car safety warranties? Should I compare THAT number to zero? The book highlights the most hellacious expense and turns it into a 250 page non-fiction book. I expected better financial advice. Explain the difference between the Adjusted Basis of a USED CAR verses the Fair Market Value (Bluebook) of the same car. Teach readers about the costs associated with major investments. It would make SENSE to comprehend actual value before spending DOLLARS. Dollars & Sense points out the fancy words can escalate the price of everything. Have you not met a CAR DEALER? They are the masterminds of escalating their commissions!!! This book needs practical knowledge about the influence of people verses spending. Would you tell a car dealer NO if he or she used extravagant language associated with a mindless expense such as a $250 car stereo?In my opinion this book deserves 2 stars. I believe there was more theory than practicality. The full book could be explained better in an Economics 101 class. "
58,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36945818-serena,4,"Boy am I ever behind in reviewing books! It's been almost two months since I finished this book, so I'll have to go off of memory for this review. Thankfully, this book about the cognitive biases influencing the way we think about money was very memorable! There are certainly more practical money-management books to read, but for a psychologist, this was perfect. Ariely and his co-author successfully applied cognitive psychology to finances and describe why so many of the decisions we make are irrational and how we can ""game"" our brains to make rational choices easier and more frequent in our lives. Reading the authors' personal stories about the situations in which they or their friends/family acted irrationally was both humorous and relateable, and being able to relate to the stories made me think hard about implementing the solutions the authors suggest. Some of the topics included ways to sneakily saving money so you don't notice you're doing it, ways to take the 'sting' our of having to pay for something (or add more 'sting' when you need to show down your spending), and the ways our mental accounting systems are faulty and can be corrected.If you've enjoyed any of Ariely's other books or are a fan of pop-psychology books in general, I would recommend this book. If you're looking for financial advice, this wouldn't be the book to start with, but might deepen your understanding of your relationship with money and finances if you've already read a few. "
59,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31980216-vanessa-princessa,4,"I read this book thanks to Blinkist.The key message in these blinks:Whether it’s basic needs like food and shelter, or luxuries like sports cars and exotic vacations, it all takes money, and it can be difficult to achieve anything if you’re constantly making bad decisions. Figuring out how to spend money wisely doesn’t come naturally, and unfortunately, money doesn’t come with an instruction manual. Instead, we’re constantly grappling with misleading value cues and struggling to understand how much things are really worth. But rather than fight against human nature, we can gain some stability by acknowledging our shortcomings and setting up systems that keep us away from our worst instincts.Actionable advice:Replace your complex budget with a simple one.An unhelpful budget can be like a bad diet that makes you obsessively measure and count every calorie. When your budget is too complicated and specific, you’ll just end up quitting in frustration. Instead, figure out how much you can comfortably spend on non-essential items and create a broad category for this called “discretionary spending.” Every week, put that amount on a prepaid debit card and you can stop worrying about overspending.Suggested further reading: The Upside of Irrationality by Dan ArielyIn The Upside of Irrationality (2011), Dan Ariely uses behavioral economics to show us why we behave irrationally, how it affects our decision-making processes, and what we can do to make better choices."

I've have a soft spot for personal finance books, but this is more ""behavioral economics meets microeconomics."" It's about why we think of money irrationally. Fans of Predictably Irrational might think ""Hey! There were some parts about money in that book. They were interesting!"" And I'm a little sad to report that those all make a reappearance, without a whole lot of added information or analysis. In fact, they would often make references like ""As in the study involving Duke basketball tickets in Predictably Irrational..."" without repeating the full context of it. All in all, it was a strange mish-mash of old and new information, although the addition of Jeff Kreisler added a lot of humor to the ""lessons.""The book also kind of contradicts itself a lot, but that's mostly because, as they say, overvaluing something can be bad, but also lets us enjoy the experience more, which is good. Someone selling cheap wine to us as special, fancy wine is manipulative and bad, but believing the hype will also make us enjoy the wine more, so...? Kind of a mixed bag. It's an interesting book, but not a very practical one if you're looking for direct advice about managing your finances."

But, but, but, this book is saved by its fruitful ideas: there are life altering landmines in this book, they explode on your face, as you navigate this frustrating murk of a jungle. It was not fun to get through. The humour is dry and offensive at times. I wanted to chuck this book in the trash, but alas, I got through it. The best part is the ending, which the author coins as free advice. In this section, it summarizes all the murk I sorted through in the other 80% of the book. It was frustrating, realizing I had been trolled by the authors (they even say this section is for those of you that are too cheap to buy this book, just flipped to the back to read the main points. So the authors create a free advice section to honour those page flippers in bookstores!)!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Read the free advice section and you’ll have all the nuggets from this book. This book should be a lengthy article, removed of its terrible humour. It should be the free advice section, a post on Google, that is free. I am thankful that I borrowed this book from the library (I would have chucked it out my window had I purchased it myself). Probably the worst finance book I’ve read in my entire life. "

This was like a step back and say ""wow, what a great job guys, you didn't have to make this so good but boom...here we are"". This book is not a silly self-help book or a boring lecture on how we should behave ourselves, but instead its like the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, but instead of galaxy its our mind and in the context of personal economics. Maybe not that silly but alas it takes you on a journey of absurdity, then you realize the absurd one is you and now that you are aware of your silliness instead of being told the ""10 easy steps to financial independence"" you are given a calibrated view of reality and an opportunity to define more accurately what the correct path is for you, which is rare and it creates a useful outlook that goes well beyond your spending habits. Regardless, I highly recommend this book, its an entertaining and enjoyable read whether you need the insights or not and if you are interested in an introspective about human behavior, how we value things and how easily we are taken advantage of then I'm sure you wont be disappointed ."
63,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793583-rochelle,5,"Think you understand your relationship to money? Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler invite you to think again in a most timely, humorous, wise and intelligent look at our relationship to our money as well as the relationship of other people to our money! In this book they ask us to look at how we arrive at the value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities that money represents. Yes, you can value a liability so much that it will blind you to the cost you incur for keeping it whether that liability is framed in terms of a choice such as your own un-examined propensity to spend now and put off saving even a modest amount for retirement, buying a wine membership when you don't really drink all that much wine, or keeping that huge energy drain of a house long after it's outgrown your true space needs. Oh and did I mention the $1450 coffee (the $4.00 latte over a year)? But this isn't all. They also propose creative ways to pay yourself first, so that ultimately you enjoy a true balance between money (which we all need) one of the means to a richer more meaningful experience of our lives (which we all desire), and peace of mind (which we all deserve). They want you to simply think more about a topic we all think we know......great read and very accessible. "
64,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18687672-zach,2,"I liked this better than Thinking Fast and Slow since this was more applied and less aimed at economists. The main lesson here is that we have no idea how much anything is actually worth, so we rely on things that are extrinsic to value, such as MSRPs or the rhetoric of sommeliers. Of course, to figure out how much something is worth, we have to weigh it against all other possible things we could spend our money on (opportunity cost), which is impossible. So we develop heuristics like comparing what we're spending to what we've spent before.There are some interesting ideas about how we could nudge people to save more. This jives with Season 2, episode 1 of Against the Rules, which I just listened to. Basically the entire financial system--especially credit cards--is designed to nudge people to overextend. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that, after telling us how irrational we are, Ariely doesn't tell us we should be more rational. Instead, we should have more empathy--to our future selves. If we can make our future selves more present, it will be much easier to make the right decisions. Or, we can harness our irrationality, such as by paying for (certain) things in advance, so that we can enjoy them more in the moment."
65,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5912188-lisa,4,"Like Dan Ariely, pyschologist and behavioral economist who writes about why we are not rational decision makers like Adam Smith claims we are. Liked this suggestion: People were less likely to misuse earmarked money that was labeled with the names of their children than if their kids were left out of the process. Another: We think of our future self as a somewhat separate person so saving for the future can feel like giving money away to a stranger rather than giving it to ourselves. We reconnect to our future selves when we visualize our older selves, think of what we will be doing when we are older, having the older self talk to our younger self - having empathy for this older person and a desire to make their life better. Also we are more likely to save for retirement when a specific date is decided upon rather than twenty years. Best solution is to make it automatic and leave ourselves out of it - ie pre-determined and automatic savings accounts and leaving investments alone. There are a lot more ideas about purchasing, ignore sales and look at opportunity costs only, don't avoid pain - spending should elicit some consequence - credit cards can be dangerous. Good book!"
66,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,2,"This book is filled with fun stuff you already know about how people aren't totally rational when it comes to spending. Stuff like how we buy stuff ""on sale"" even if the sale price is what the regular price should be, and how the first price we get influences how much we're willing to pay, and how credit cards make us spend more by moving some of the pain of spending into the future and how a more expensive bottle of wine must be ""better"" and how hard it is to save for the future. It's filled with what I'd call pseudo-scientific psychology experiments designed to prove what we already know about human behavior.If you honestly think reading a book about this is going to change your behavior in a financially positive way, it may be worthwhile. Otherwise, it's a waste of time, and although it started out promising, I didn't think it was even all that much fun.The authors add little jokes here and there which I found annoying. They either a) think they are a lot funnier than they actually are, b) are trying unsuccessfully to lighten up an already light-weight book, or c) winking at the reader to say they don't really take this stuff seriously either."

Reading this may indeed save you considerable money. But that will come from the insights these two behavior economists provide about how our emotions and the companies who prey on them lead us astray when it comes to valuing and selecting products we buy. Whether it is through the use of “anchor” prices cleverly inserted by sellers, or simply the ease of paying for an item, the authors discuss a wide variety of practices that lead us to prefer one product over another, or judge the fairness of the price we’re asked to pay. Backed by academic studies and enlivening by considerable levity, you’ll find yourself gaining a new perspective on your spending practices and an awareness of how companies are manipulating your feelings and preferences. This is a delightful book that will be enjoyed even by those who never before considered reading something written by an economist. And reading it should provide you a set of practical insights that will save you the price of the book many times over."

Combined with similar mistakes (short-sightedness, mainly) that humans make with respect to other parts of their personal lives (diet and exercise for example), it's hard to maintain an optimistic view of the ""average"" person. The advice section of the book (how to ""spend smarter"") left a bit to be desired in terms of actionable items (basically boils down to: 1) be aware of the dumb things you are inclined to do and don't do them (or at least have a rational reason as to why you are doing) and 2) spend more time on the big decisions). These seem like the type of things more financially responsible people do already and things that would be too ""hard"" for others (if they even read this book).A quick read, especially if you skim over familiar concepts. Worth a checkout from the library if you're decently familiar with behavioral economics, potentially worth a buy if you aren't and need more time to let the findings sink in."

He covers - How we overlook opportunity costs - Make decisions based on anchoring and saliencey - Weight losses more than gains, which leads to segregating gains and aggregate losses - Overweight the present and discount the future - How the timing of when we pay also matters - The endowment effects and how we overvalue what we own and are influenced by sunk costs - How we suck at avoiding temptation and can do better creating environments to remove it - How we make decisions based on relative worth and value - How we compartmentalize and engage in emotional and (malleable) mental accounting - How we judge value based on observable effort, not hidden skill - How language and ritual increases the sense of how much something is worth, and the impact of virtual ownership"
70,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982999-les,3,"So, this rating is not entirely fair. The authors do a thorough and intriguing job of detailing how and why people ""misthink money"". It's one of the best I've read and I have an entirely new depth of perception about my fiscal decision-making. HOW. EV. VER. Their ""how to spend smarter"" falls short of being included in the title. There are theoretical and ""wouldn't it be nice"" strategies mixed in with a sparse amount of ""do this"" strategies. They are bigger picture thinkers, so this is the reason. But the book is mis-marketed as far as I'm concerned. Also, these two really think they are hilarious and their humor gets very stale very quickly. It's something the reader must endure, but yes - it was worth it to get the information. Still, for the background/psych info alone, this book was second to the best book on money I've ever read (""it's not about the money"" by Brent Kessel), which was much more hands on and big picture, yet with enough concrete, small detail to be of more use. I'll give Ariely another go because he is smart and thorough, but it will be with caution."
71,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13965568-carter,4,"There are many personal finance books that provide practical advice detailing the step-by-step ""how to"" of resolving debt and managing your finances. However, the component that always seems to be missing is the psychology underpinning the necessary behavior changes to successfully implement the steps. Enter Dollars and Sense. This book is the missing piece, the nitty gritty of how we perceive money and why we keep making the same mistakes. I've fallen off the wagon with money enough to feel the pain and I was usually left standing in the dust berating myself but not able to fully understand what happened or how to prevent it in the future. Through scientific investigation, this book explores how we think about money and what motivates our decisions with money. That alone makes this worth the read. Once we understand something, we can approach it differently. Dollars and Sense also provides strategies for overcoming these money mistakes, which has the potential to support lasting behavior change. There wasn't a penny wasted on this book."
72,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3285213-craig-amason,3,"The title of this book should probably be Dollars and Common Sense, simply because so much of what is discussed here is common knowledge to most people who have ever given any thought to personal finance and human behavior. Having said that, there are a few valuable nuggets here and there, along with some fascinating examples from the world of commerce. The writing is clever, entertaining, and even humorous. What really made the book so enjoyable for me was the fact that I elected to listen to it as an audio book from Audible. Simon Jones was a perfect choice to read this book. His British accent combined with his uncanny natural talent for snarkiness made listening to the anecdotes and explanations infinitely better than had I simply read the book on my own. I laughed out loud at least a dozen times during the course of the book. I highly recommend this particular audio version of the book."
73,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6939387-becky,3,"Not one of Dan Ariely’s best books. It was interesting but the concepts were repeated too many times. I understand that repetition and explaining something in different ways can help learning and retention but there was just too much. And while the topics were interesting, I didn’t always see a direct connection to the topic of money and spending. There seemed to be significant rehashing of topics from his previous books. There were certainly some interesting take-always that may influence my spending a bit. How the concept of value is based on comparison. Or, how we treat money different than the items that money purchases (losing $100 or losing a theater ticket). I may be more aware of add-ons when I make large purchases. I “read” this as an audiobook. I think I would have preferred reading an actual book or electronic version. To me Dan’s humor didn’t translate well to audio although the narrator made a good effort. "
74,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20769111-seth-davis,4,"Lately, I've found myself burned out with the same behavioral economics topics and references coming up in seemingly every book I've read. This book should have been one of the worst offenders since essentially nothing in it is new. And yet, for me, it wasn't. Looking at the full complement of Dan Ariely's research along with the other standard folks (Thaler, etc) with the focused lens of how consumers interact with money made for a cohesive structure. This makes the book a useful, focused re-summary of the key research through a specific lens. I also enjoyed the sprinkling of economist dry humor throughout.If you aren't into this topic or are only superficially interested in behavioral economics this book is probably a 3. If you have any relevant use at the time you read it such as work in the financial arena, as I found that I did, the book is probably a 5. Thus I'll rate it overall as a 4."
75,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book is not intended to help you with your budget, or with paying off credit card. Rather, it is an overview of the many ways we are irrational about money. We overvalue what we have (endowment effect), we dislike losing money more than we enjoy receiving money, we are unduly influenced by the apparent effort that has gone into a product/service. When we don't really know the true value of a product, we tend to anchor it to the price of something similar, or even what other people seem to think is the appropriate value. Full of examples of psychological experiments, this book opened my eyes to the irrationality with which we approach money. I can't say that any practical solutions were given - credit cards and Apple pay aren't going to disappear simply because we feel it makes it too easy for us to spend our hard-earned money - but awareness is the first step towards improvement. I also enjoyed the fact that the book was very funny in a self-deprecating way."
76,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39584416-kate,3,"I enjoyed this but wanted more actionable advice and ideas. It was interesting learning about the ways in which we trick ourselves or are being tricked without realizing it, and the book was generally entertaining. But I completed the book with the sense that I may not have gained much from reading it; even the reminder that I am instinctively irrational about money will likely fade before long. I do plan to re-read the last section and try to use a few of the techniques, but though the explanation behind them was new to me and fascinating, the techniques themselves are not really unique.I'm conflicted about the rating because if I had read the book assuming it would just be an interesting journey into the minds of humans, I think I would rate it a 4. But because the title led me to expect clear and actionable tips/planning ideas, I was a bit disappointed."

Would have appreciated a deeper walk through strategies for success in one's financial life. This would be a good book to hand someone coming out of college and entering the working world. In a nutshell, marketers have known for years how to pull at our irrational behaviors and self rationalizations on spending money. It's increasingly becoming more and more easy for sellers to lubricate dollars from our wallets. If we stand a chance at saving we need to learn selling tactics, re-frame the ""negotiation"" (ie purchase decision), and better yet, from the get go, pay ourselves by automating savings directed to low cost, broad based investment vehicles. With savings automation, our ability to self destruct our financial selves dramatically lessons. "
78,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17456366-paul-davidson,4,"I found the topic interesting, and the arguments contained within are supported with experiments and anecdotes which are convincing. I think the information gained will help discern how to strategically make financial decisions that are more optimal. Towards the end the authors make the argument that it would be better to take a $12,000 bonus in monthly payments of $1,000, instead of an annual lump sum. While theoretically, this may help an employee make wiser financial decisions. In the real world, you take the bonus as soon as you can get it, you never know when the company will pull some shenanigans and find a way to not pay it.Holding this back from five stars is the writing style and the stale jokes.

The two points I got the most out of this book were the pain of spending money and the anchoring cost of something. I do use cash for daily spending so I am quite aware of the pain of spending money. It is true that when I have to spend cash on a coffee or a book, I think about what I might need that cash for otherwise...and it does influence the purchase of a book, or whether to have a sweet treat with the coffee. With regards to the anchor price of an item, I think I will consider that it is just a number somebody somewhere put on it, and I can choose to decide if it is something I wish to purchase....that it’s value is to be determined by me and not just an arbitrary number.

But the British narrator made the book more entertaining.There are, surprisingly, quite a few jokes in this book. I think I would have grown tired of them if I had read the book, but the narrator did a really good job of delivering the jokes... so they were a little more bearable.Toward the end of the book, one small bit of information stuck out to me. A certain amount of data tracking can encourage a person to exercise more, read more, etc. But too much data tracking can actually have the opposite effect, causing a person to do less of a specific activity.I've actually experienced this, but had not articulated the thought in my mind. Now that I know this, I plan to be more selective about which activities I track."

You will most likely instantly start to see how your own behaviour fits with the lessons of this book. Dan Ariely's works always revolve around themes like biases and irrationality and this one too. But as the title hints this deals with a certain kind of irrationality: irrationality induced by money. You might think: How big a deal can this be? I know I am pretty smart. But i'm pretty certain that you will be less confident about your own ability to be rational after reading this book. And this is good because this will make you think. And ohh, not to forget: Dan Ariely has a very entertaining style, it is simply fun to read and his books are well edited so he doesn't repeat the points of the book endlessly as so many other books these days!"

I felt it a bit uneven because it's about half psychological research results and 1/3 advice on how to apply those traits. (The remaining 1/6 is attempts to be funny, with mixed success.) And because Ariely is a good scientist, there is not a lot of truly solid recommendations, more along the lines of you could do this or you could do that. Since one of the points of the book is that real humans have predictable flaws and not enough time combining to make them behave less than rationally, I would've appreciated more solid advice.One thing that really comes through is that my kids are now paying for everything in cash, rather than loans from the bank of Dad. :-)"

Do you know the first time you see a price, it's now anchored in your mind and everything else is either more or less than that price, even if it's not even the right one? There were so many writer-downers in this book I wish it wasn't a library book that I had to return, but alas....I will not spend the money to buy it because I know I probably won't read it again, but I WILL certainly be thinking of how I spend money differently.Have an option of one fat bonus or a payout over time?

Like the way we react to framing.The way Jeff writes makes it very easy to read and enjoy. A lot of examples to support the theories.Even being familiar with the topic and reading it mainly for research, the book made me consider a few things I should be more careful about regarding the management of my money."

I think the authors felt that their readers would be all men based on the asinine and sexist asides about women/wives/partners. In general the book brought up a lot of good points and things to think about when making financial decisions. Things like: valuation (what is something worth), opportunity cost (If I buy X, then I won’t be able to buy or do Y). A good chunk of the buckle spent mainly just talking about the importance of saving whether it’s retirement, or through other means. At this point I feel like renaming my savings account to Beachhouse retirement home as more motivation to save more money."

A funnier and more focused version (on money) of Predictably Irrational. You may not want to read this if you've read that one, but it was still a good reinforcement for me on how to make the right financial decisions. It was an easy read and quite funny while teaching important lessons. I especially enjoyed the parts about how to not overvalue perceived effort and transparency and how to think about sunk costs. This is NOT ""how to make a budget and save for retirement"" book; it really explores why our brains make this hard to do and helps with super practical advice on how to better THINK about our financial goals and plans for the future.

What I feel works really well for dollars and sense is that it recognizes that we're human and gives us tools for dealing with these follies. It explains the cognitive biases and how to deal with it leverage them.This book works well for people who want to tools and not a prescription (and some people may just want a prescription, that's not a bad thing), and have a high tolerance for Dad jokes.

This book is about how people tend to look at money, spend money in certain situations like cash vs credit and how they save or not for retirement. It is more about the psychology but it will definitely change you - it will make you rethink your existing spending habits and potentially change your money mindset for the future. A fun way to get highlights of what behavioral economics can teach us about money.Also worth noting is that this book includes a very nice discussion of Mental Accounting, which is probably the most substantial research contribution of Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics this year."
91,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55540271-sangeetha,2,I love Dan but this book dragged on for much longer than it should have. Repetitive and less important concepts were explored in just as much detail as the truly impactful ones (which were few in the first place). Truly believe there should be a reader competency rating with these books so that we do not have to sit through winded explanations of VERY WELL known concepts like the 'endowment effect' or 'loss aversion'. Or at least make 'Thinking fast and slow' recommended reading before starting a book in the same genre. It's definitely a much much superior book and would make a good starting point that authors can draw on rather than then coming up with their inferior rendition of the same concept. I am rambling now but I am tired of re-reading these theories.
92,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47916415-sharan,5,"The Human behavior is interesting when it comes to handling money. As Dan says in the book, we live in the day of age where everything around us screams for our attention, time, health and finally money. From the series of experiments that Dan conducted, on behavior economics one could definitely learn all the subtle, or sometimes the obvious ways the human emotions or the external forces i.e., advertisements etc., play against the rational behavior, leading us to make irrational decisions. Specifically when it is with the money, we are clueless. All proven with research and experiments. Every page offered something new and 'Aha' moments. I would definitely re-visit this book, hence 5/5 rating."

This book is better written and much more tongue in cheek than many like it, with a fair amount of humor that makes it much easier to take. The message is certainly on task; pay attention to your financial present and future, do things in moderation and don't be too susceptible to the marketing tricks of the world. Th common problem of making a statement at the start of a chapter and then repeating it all throughout is not as prevalent here as it is in many, but it still occurs quite a bit. A quick perusal, a little bit to take with."

The authors lay out all of the psychological tricks and traps that keep us poor and/or insecure about money. They use relatable stories to make the concepts easy to digest.

It must be a great bargain because its 'regular' price was soo high. Other books talk about the nitty- gritty of how to save a buck by buying coffee at the store and making it at home. This one talks about the thoughts behind wanting a $4. 00 coffee in the first place. And how you can 'trick' yourself into saving more by reminding yourself on a regular basis that that's your goal.The book is a bit long and their jokes are corny but it's written for easy reading and comprehension"

But this book gives us great examples on how to avoid misleading value cues and instead understand the real value of things. Some interesting examples like how JCPenny lost millions just because of putting ""fair and square"" prices in contrast to a false ilusion of their customers who thought were getting bargains because of coupons in marked up prices; which would you prefer: live with 20% less of your salary, or living off 80% of your salary? sometimes it's all about perception.

I would have preferred a bit more actionable content--the ""how to spend smarter"" material is some general guidelines along the lines of ""don't do what we just spent the last 200 pages telling you about--but that's just me.And of course, it's always amusing to laugh at the tales of those who apparently cannot deal well enough with simple math to realize that their choices on a survey question are economically equivalent, just described in terms of either a gain or a loss."

If you have no background in behavioral economics this book provides some decent insights, otherwise much of it covers topics such as loss aversion that are better deal with in other like books like Thinking Fast and Slow. At the same time they do keep it interesting and I didn't find any sections particularly tedious. If there is one major hinderance (for the audiobook), it is the narrator. I found him to be pompous and hard to listen to, especially when he conveyed jokes or made feeble attempts at various accents--the terrible Boston accent comes to mind. If I had to do it again I'd skip the audiobook. "

If so his humor can best be described as a bad comedian's impression of a bad comedian. Even without the attempts at humor this book might have, at best, been a serviceable overview of a lot of good research. Better to just go to the sources and read Thaler or Kahneman."

But I knew most of the insights and concepts. For example, if we buy something in advance, rather than at the time of the experience, we do t feel the “pain” of the purchase as much. And anchoring plays a big part in how much we think something should cost, even of that anchored price is totally arbitrary. And losses impact us roughly 2x more than gains. And when we own something, we value it more, which is we we overprice our homes when we want to sell them. So, some useful stuff, but none of it was groundbreaking. "

I started my journey with behavioral economics from „Predictably Irrational” and it still thrives. I liked this one, as it collects richness of research insights on money and finance, especially behavioral/psychological mistakes we make in our day to day lives. As always, written with humor and distance, it presents some research cases, which were already well-known, but few are relatively new. I think it’s a good addition to Polish „Finansowy Ninja” od Michal Szafranski.If you know BE concepts then you may not discover that much, but pretty worthwhile when you want to learn more about personal finance."

The reasons we spend poorly seemed so similar to reasons we eat poorly and this book gives a great review of the mindsets we struggle with when spending. I won’t outline the book here, but it’s a really good read. There’s some humour thrown in - but a few jokes made me cringe of inappropriateness...or thinking “can’t you find a better example or scenario to fit”? You really had to throw in “women say they wear ugly underwear to prevent themselves from going too far on dates” when demonstrating what we do to avoid situations to spend money?

I figured I would have heard most of the advice in this book before, but it wasn't necessarily advice: it was discussing experiments and their outcomes, giving real life examples, and identifying the way we compartmentalize money that can actually hurt is in the long run.Many of the comments I see below say that this book is repetitive if you have read any of Ariely's other books, but this is my first so I cannot speak to this.I laughed out loud at least once a chapter, and that is tough to do in a money book. 4.5/5"

This one doesn't seem to offer much that isn't already available through money blogs and magazine coverage. It's a lot on how we misthink money but very little on how to spend smarter and of that very little, nothing was new. They note that more needs done to discover how to think smarter. Maybe the next book will cover that. If you're new to learning how our minds aren't rational about money, this will be enlightening. If you already know much of anything about behavioral economics, you probably don't need to bother. "

If you've read other books by him you probably won't learn many new facts but you will get good reminders (it is frustrating how knowing the traps in my mind I still fall for them). He does offer concrete suggestions on how individuals can think about their own spending to make personal changes. He also offers constructive policy suggestions that we can advocate for.Don't look for ground breaking new research in this book, look for examples of previous ground breaking research and solid suggestions."

The gist of the endowment effect “is that the current owner of an item overvalues it, and because of that will want to sell it at a higher price than the future owner will be willing to pay for it...Typically, in experiments testing the endowment effect, selling prices are found to be about twice as high as buying prices...when we own something, not only do we start believing that it is worth more, but, furthermore, we believe that other people will naturally see this extra value and be willing to pay for it.”“Fundamentally, when we value effort over outcome, we’re paying for incompetence.”"

One part that I really liked was when he discusses ways to have more self-control in terms of our spending. We often lack self-control because we discount the future and are emotionally detached from it--so we struggle with overcoming the temptations of today. I agree with writing a letter to your future self (which you can do at futureme.org) about our needs, greatest joys, toughest regrets, etc when we're 65+. This applies to all things beyond just money talk."

But there are some interesting concepts in this book that I wish I paid more attention to in the past. Understanding how we make decisions and how easily we are influenced (often without even realizing it) will increase my awareness in the future. I also liked his rational approach to money - yes, we need it to pay our bills, and we need to save for the future, but it is also meant for the purchase of enjoyment.

This book takes some of the work from previous books, adds in Jeff's humor to present all the problems you and I have when dealing with money. The book isn't dry when talking about money. Or the behavior of humans (not economists) when it comes to money. They will make you laugh and be uncomfortable at the same time. I believe anyone will see themselves in the descriptions and stories. At the same time the authors attempt to educate the reader on how to deal with the limitations of the human brain."

I have already begun thinking more about opportunity costs for how I spend my money I a broader way, e.g., tickets to another concert or a dinner out when on holiday. However, it felt a little overdone at points, even though I certainly laughed out loud sometimes. The book stayed at a very superficial level on behavioural psychology points, neither going deep into the experiments nor providing any comparative or critical analysis. Overall I’m glad I’m read it as it’s such an important topic, and the authors provided valuable insights. "
115,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632701-sarah,3,"This book looks at behavior economics, how and why we spend money, how we feel about it, depending on the circumstances, and how marketers have figured out how to get us to part with our money faster than ever before. Interesting studies present the psychology of money, how our brains function when we part with it, and why people have such a hard time saving. Probably good for fans of Freakonomics series. Some interesting tidbits, and I did (experimentally) cancel my Amazon Prime membership after reading."

Though I realize that is an unfair assessment on my part. Dan & Jeff went through great lengths to identify why we make certain choices about money and I found the information very informative. Is it practical to ponder all of these insights prior to making a major purchase? Yes! Is it practical in daily life? Probably not. Nonetheless, if your aim is to become more informed about strategies that pull at your attention (and wallet) I definitely suggest this book. "

I chuckled and nodded my way through so many weird ways in which we think about money.

He also offers brief advices on ways to make better decisions to maximize our long-term gain. This book is hilarious and easy to read.

219,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17639786-taylor-ellwood,5,Dollars and Sense is an excellent book that helps readers explore their relationship with money and why they have the spending habits they have. A good 2/3rds of the book is dedicated to uncovering the behaviors behind our spending habits and showing people how to recognize those behaviors. The last 1/3rd of the book is focused on possible solutions and changes we can make to be better spenders of our own money. I recommend this book if you want to understand your own spending habits.

277,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"A brilliant, and very helpful book -- if you're willing to be honest with yourself. All our tendencies to mishandle money are spelled out here, in clever examples, clear choices, and witty asides. Ariely and his fellow writer keep things moving, but manage to point out how we are easily fooled by anchoring, valuing the present over the future to the detriment of our savings, loss aversion, and on and on. I ended the book with a long list of things to think about differently. "
278,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7717055-djoko-atkinson,4,Dan Ariely mainly tells us about the psychology behind our dum decision especially when it comes to spending money. We often rely on mental accounting and emotional accounting to justify financial habits that is unjustifiable. Dollars and Sense constantly remind us about the increasingly capitalized world preys on us due to our bad financial instincts and less painful payment. I do like the few pages resume at the last part of the book covering almost all important aspects of the book.
279,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17639786-taylor-ellwood,5,Dollars and Sense is an excellent book that helps readers explore their relationship with money and why they have the spending habits they have. A good 2/3rds of the book is dedicated to uncovering the behaviors behind our spending habits and showing people how to recognize those behaviors. The last 1/3rd of the book is focused on possible solutions and changes we can make to be better spenders of our own money. I recommend this book if you want to understand your own spending habits.

If you've read any of them (even Dan Ariely's own books), most of the examples will feel recycled here. Personally, the constant injection of ""humour"" by Jeff Kreisler came off as trying too hard and worked as filler/padding. If these portions were taken out of the book, it'd probably shave off 50-60 pages. Dan Ariely's style in his other books like Predictably Irrational was just fine and worked much better. "
281,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7199900-chad-gramling,4,"A Deep But Fun Read on How we Think About MoneyThis book is not the typical stodgy financial book. It is practical and helps us see why we have the relationships with money that we do. It's not a how-to, nor is it a paint-by-numbers system. Instead, it helps you gain wisdom for designing habits and behaviors into your own life and business to rise above. A lot of cultural references to help break up the subject matter and bring it down to casual reader levels. Thanks guys!"
282,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74991462-david-wunderlich,3,"Take the major points of Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and then mix in a bunch of Richard Thaler’s behavioral economics insight. Sprinkle in some of Ariely’s experimental results before writing a breezy pop-psychology book on personal finance and voila, you have this book.It’s an easier and faster read than Thinking Fast and Slow, but if you’ve read that as I have, a ton of this book is recap. It’s entertaining enough that I finished but I didn’t get much out of it."
283,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269379-holly-vipond,4,"I wanted to give it 3.5 so I rounded up. The stories in this book are great, for illustrating the concepts (better than most books teaching the same concepts). It was longer and more repetitive than necessary and toward the end I found myself getting bored, but that may be because I’ve read a number of books in the same vein. People who aren’t familiar with the concepts would likely get a lot more out of it. "
284,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46978193-matt-seltzer,4,"Another great book by one of my favorite behavioral economists. This book attempts to capture our irrationality with money, and to that end it definitely succeeds. Not a ton to really take away from this book other than that it’s interesting. There’s a layer of self help that might be there too, but at its core this is really just a book discussing a fascinating topic that most of us don’t realize exists. "
285,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51660510-jonathan-fang,4,"Why do smart people make dumb, irrational financial decisions? It is in our nature. Emotions, failure to delay gratification, cognitive bias and heuristics are the usual culprits. Behavioral economist and psychologist Dan Ariely offers a scientific view point and explains concepts such as sunk cost, lost aversion, anchor effect, etc with vivid examples. He also offers brief advices on ways to make better decisions to maximize our long-term gain. This book is hilarious and easy to read. To those who just want to manage their personal finances better, this book is more practical than Daniel Kahneman’s classic book Thinking, Fast and Slow."
286,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9599894-nikita-vasilyev,4,"This book highlights people's irrational behavior behind money spendings, notably subscription models, per diem vs la carte, and ""fair"" price.More than half of this book is reciting of Predictably Irrational, the book Dan Ariely published 9 years before Dollars and Sense. However, it's a good read if you haven't read anything by Dan Ariely.This book is a must-read for people who sell their products and services."
287,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3172687-mamie,3,"This book was fine. I have read others that were much more eye opening and kept me more engaged. This book does show some of our key reactions/relationships with money, but the challenge is that those reactions/relationships are often in opposition to one another. That feels about right in a way, but it also means that the book and it's suggestions are much more muddled than some of the insights in other books by Dan Ariely that I have enjoyed much more."
288,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5022884-dan,2,"I've enjoyed Dan Ariely a lot before, but this book just felt like his other stuff recycled with a narrower focus. I think they particularly dropped the ball by not going further with the practical applications section. If you want the interesting social psych/behavior economics, just read Predictably Irrational instead. If you actually want to make better financial decisions, try I Will Teach You To Be Rich."
289,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318754-andrienne,5,"After reading this book, a book that I was reading on financial stability was abandoned. This book solved it for me. What is the root of money woes? This book will shed a light on the topic. This is like finding a book that really makes you lose weight without relying on a fad diet. It will stop you cold. I loved it! Access to review copy provided by the publisher. "
290,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366373-tasha,3,"More like 3.5 stars. I LOVED the beginning, which was fascinating, funny, and very engaging. I learned a lot! Unfortunately the later chapters felt repetitive and some topics were beaten to death. Still, I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to ""spend smarter"" and get more enjoyment out of what they use money for."
291,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/726166-zoe,3,"Some good advice, a bit repetitive. Thanks to them I will be aware of the many tricks that businesses use to try to trick you into buying things quickly without thinking. Although I will probably still use a credit card instead of cash, I will try to be more aware of the ""pain of paying"" in order to cut back on my spending."
292,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10756779-wayne,4,"Not sure I learned a whole lot with this book. But having read Dan Ariely's other books, I gave it a go. Actually I listened to this as an audio book and the narrator Simon Jones is FABULOUS. I would listen to him read the white pages for a while. He brings wit and humor to a book that could have been fairly tedious."
293,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64844266-valentina,4,"Interesting book about the psychology of money and spending. It has a lot of random data and stats. Some chapters left me thinking - so, what do I do with that? It isn't the most practical but I think it's good to be aware of how certain circumstances and scenarios affect our decision making when it comes to money. "
294,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3162491-bryan,2,"Interesting set of tidbits but still ends up being a slow readThere are numerous examples in the book that were interesting. They do in fact get you thinking. For some reason, I did feel the book dragging on - I'm not sure what I can attribute this to! The authors tried their best to inject some humor here and there. "
295,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2295890-jeanie,4,"If you read the previous book by Ariely, ""Predictably Irrational,"" at good third of this book will be review for you. If you are the least bit interested in the quirkiness of human behavior, you will be entertained by ""Dollars and Sense."" The review is not boring and the newer material is worth the time."
296,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6327229-hadi-hassanali,4,"Another great book by Dan Ariely.Not a great deal of new information and/or theories, but a new take on the material customised to the topic at hand. Doesn't get too overwhelming or boring due to the additional humour thrown into the book. Teaches you once again that we are not wired to be good with money, but outlines the potential pitfalls for those wishing to be."
297,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/238446-david,2,"There's a lot of good content in this book. If you've never read any behavioral economics books before, you'll probably like it. However, if you have read books on this subject -- including books by Ariely -- you'll recognize that most of the content is borrowed or recycled from other books. Not cool."
298,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5501950-kate,2,"Anyone who tells me it's a better idea to choose a 7% credit card with a $100 annual fee over a 10% credit card with $0 annual fee needs to stop writing finance books. The correct answer is: hells yes I'm choosing the card with a $0 fee, because the ACTUAL number one rule of credit cards is, NEVER EVER EVER CARRY A BALANCE. "
299,0062651226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19553825-velanche,5,"I’ve never read “Predictably Irrational,’ but perhaps I should after reading this book. Both the wry humor and the deep dive into how we, as humans, react to money, from how we spend it to how we place value on what we spend, makes this an enlightening and engaging book. It’s funny how humans work, and this book proves that we are more susceptible than we’ll admit. Fascinating. "
