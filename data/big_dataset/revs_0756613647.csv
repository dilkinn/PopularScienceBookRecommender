0,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,I've had this fascinating book for years and I love to spend lazy afternoons looking through it. DK books are just the best! Chock-full of information along with stunning visuals! Great series of books!
1,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,5,"This book stays in the passenger seat of my car. If I ever get stuck somewhere, or whenever I just have a few minutes to spare, I pick it up and open it to a random page and start reading. I haven't read the whole thing, from front to back, and yet I will give it five stars. There are so many illustrations and diagrams and inserts and mini-biographies crammed on to each page that this is not a book that you read from left to right. You read around in a circle, and then down in the left corner, and then over on the right somewhere. The words follow the pictures. It is a fun way to read- well that's not quite it, because reading isn't really what's going on here. It is a fun way to get information. This is a book that I would like to hang on to for many years, which brings me to my biggest complaint. The binding is AWFUL. It started to fall apart almost as soon as I bought it. If there is a better version out there with nice binding I would happily pay twice as much for something that will last a while. But I learned way to much from this book to subtract a star because of the binding. It was tempting..."

""Universe, A Definitive Visual Guide"", which I intentionally spent more than two months finishing, is an encyclopedia about, you guess it, the universe. From the Big Bang, to the Solar System, the Milky Way, Galaxy clusters and deep space, it tirelessly explores the secrets and physical of the cosmos, attaching mini-biographies of important scientists, myth, diagrams, and breathtakingly colorful illustrations, whiping off readers' boredom and showering the enthusiasm. Not only information on space will you be learning from this book, but also physics, chemistry and history related to astronomy itself. Plus, it excites the readers with its detailed charts including constellations and orbits of planets of the night sky for every month of the years. No kidding, I predict this will be staying at least at the top two in my science category booklist although I still have many informative science books awaiting for me. I highly recommend this book to those who want to dive into Universe!"
3,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38659489-aruon,5,If you're curious and wondering about the universe then I highly recommend this encyclopedia
4,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18749791-dainis-k,5,This book is really awesome if you want to learn fundamentals about the universe. I guess it is written in simple language understandable for most of laypeople. Many illustrations and graphical explanations provide very useful support.
5,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85376295-prejudice-neutrino,5,Beautiful introduction to cosmology and astronomy. Fabulous images and models to represent concepts discussed as well!
6,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105099070-douglas-anderson,5,"Very interesting , a good learning experience and very profound."
7,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5886505-nicole,5,"Brilliant, detailed guide replete with photos, Star maps, and all the latest information about our universe. Cannot recommend enough."
8,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38469341-aj,5,Childhood favorite. Beautiful. Informative. Captivating.
9,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78333862-geoffrey,5,This is such an awesome coffee-table book to have whenever you wanna browse through and find something interesting to read about that has to do with our mysterious and fascinating universe. Gorgeous full color illustrations and photos. I get lost in this book for hours at a time. This is definitely not the type of book you start at beginning and read all the way through to the end. Fun to peruse at your leisure!
10,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115558783-alex-kahn,5,"Extraordinarily comprehensive, with captivating pictures. Dense, thorough, and inspiring."
11,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,5,"Another amazing book from DK - This like the previous books Human - I have had for a while and dipped in to on a number of occasions and been amazed at the sheer quality of information, sumptuousness of the photography and the amazing quantity of fascinating facts. Yes I love my general knowledge as much as my fiction and at times its amazing to see that the ""real"" world can be just amazing, beautiful and terrifying as any work of fiction. And the truly amazing thing is that there is still so much out there still to learn. "
12,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3113583-adam,3,"The first chapter or two deserve five-star ratings. Seriously, they were mind-blowing and very absorbing.But I was quickly lost in later chapters with the morass of star descriptions, Venusian volcanoes blurbs, and seen-one-you've-seen-'em-all nebulae. It's beautifully illustrated but the deeper one goes, the lighter on interesting content it becomes. Hopefully, space doesn't prove the same."
13,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4316522-pierce,5,"This book is a very good book to read if you get the time to because this book is very long and heavy Nd has small text. This book will speak to anybody that likes to learn about what happened to us before we came to life here on earth. It will also appeal to anybody that wants to know about the unknown facts of planets,moons, and much more because it gives information that little tiny books don't. "
14,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15426832-artem-gordon,5,BAM! POW! This is THE book you need to have if you are an amateur like me with a desire to become a professional. It has great pictures that help you engage your entire mind along with the given information. This book even made me get astronomical binoculars so that I can view the universe while learning it at the SAME TIME. For now... this is my bible. 6/5 Stars. P.S Get the new revised and updated version!!! The new version binding is much much better than the older version. 
15,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5457246-f-p,5,"Awesome large book--I couldn't resist buying it. I like it more for the pictures than the text information--not that the latter is badly done; it's just more like captions of information than a sustained text. I think it's always best to consult science textbooks for any real science applications, but big books like this are very helpful references to me for doing fictional space art because I can more clearly see what the natural forms look like. "
16,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/816438-tim,4,"wow. kick yourself for never having taken an astronomy course in college, and then pick up this byoot of a pictorial and have yourself a lesson in some earth science goodness. gorgeous, up-to-date (black holes as centers of galaxies, pluto is a dwarf, etc.), and way cheaper and more accurate than that university of phoenix course you were eyeing."
17,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2499089-tireymcinnes,5,"I can really get into stuff pertaining to the Universe. The pictures alone are worth buying this book, but the way the science is explained is pretty awesome too. If you're into this topic, you have to check this out."
18,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,3,"The visual imagery in this book is wonderful! It would be a great book to have to reference anything having to do with astronomy, but the pictures and visual representations are really what make this book."
19,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643313-will,2,This is a reference book and not one that you would read as a novel. Therefore I am continuing to refer to it from time to time whenever I find the inclination to do so. Much of it is quite technical and difficult to understand.
20,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/804161-jessica,5,"This is the updated version and a nice, hefty hardback. The pictures are lovely and show the depth and enormity of space. Lots of good information as well, but the pictures are, by far, the best part."
21,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23010080-harianja-natalyne,5,"marvelous .... not yet finish the book but this book opens my mind and perspective widely how small we are in the universe .... do we have purpose, living in the tiny space ? .... the writers made lot of efforts in collecting all pictures wjkch made this book great, love it"
22,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3614449-stephie,5,Features beautiful full colour photos and illustrations. This is one of the few books I actually enjoy browsing quite frequently. It contains a lot of information without being too simple or too dense. 
23,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/804161-jessica,4,Wonderful pictures of neubulas and planets. A bit cluttered in places... sometimes all the little information boxes made the glorious pictures get lost.
24,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1735478-anna,5,Amazing! Informative and beautiful. If you enjoy astronomical science as a hobby this book is perfect. A perfect Christmas present. Thanks Mom and Pop! 
25,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15835525-andrew-whitaker,5,The binding is the only issue ive had with the 2 copies i have of this book.Both of them fell apart.Including the $40 hard copy i have.Otherwise full of great info and pictures
26,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15685161-isaiahd,5,"This book is easy enough to understand for amateur astronomer, but challenging enough for advanced learners of astronomy. This is a book that should be on the book shelf of every astronomer "

28,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17047088-nicholas-ives,4,"Beautiful book. The introductory chapters are very informative, especially on physics and the creation of the universe."
29,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20009384-xo,3,"Nice but is a pity that the text and images are not very good organized in most pages. Is little dated too. Other than that, enjoy!"
30,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38702272-juraj-kubica,5,Universal contemporary encyclopedia of knowledge on our Universe written by the best astronomers in the world. I was one of the translators of this book for Slovak edition.
31,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44410628-ezra-ozaki,4,Good enough to provide some general information about the universe but not really digging deep as I wishThe book does contain many stunning images from Hubbles Space Telescope that is a huge plus.
32,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30965312-juan-r-os,5,Awesome compilation of pictures depicting the magic and mysteriousness of the universe

34,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16303773-jennifer-kelly,5,I keep this beside my bed at all times. Gives me perspective. 
35,0756613647,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60706064-nell,4,"Great pictures, excellent explanations, and easy to predict where you might want to skip or skim."
