0,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi,5,"I enjoyed reading In a Different Key a great deal, and I learned a lot from it. The authors cover a huge amount of territory, from the first person who ever received a diagnosis of ""autism"" to the latest thinking about what is now known as ""autism spectrum disorder."" The book is written with great compassion and meticulous care.What this book did for me was make me realize (once again?) that 99% of what we all know to be ""true""about autism is actually the result of flawed thinking, combined with the egotism of a handful psychiatrists,human greed, media frenzy, and the force of loving, desperate parents looking for any way to help their child. This history is a story of people lurching from one explanation to another with horrifying rapidity and along the way doing terrible harm to children and their families.I've lived through many of those explanations for autism myself. When I was very young my best friend's brother was sent away to live with Bruno Bettlelheim, who in the 60's convinced everyone that autistic children had been emotionally abused by their mothers. Then came the era of Applied Behavioral Analysis, where children were slapped or given electric shocks to persuade them to behave--everyone believed in ABA for a while and it still has its proponents especially as the negative reinforcements are replaced by more positive reinforcements. Then came the ""Vaccinations Cause Autism"" decade, a debacle that funneled millions of dollars of research money away from any meaningful research into the causes of autism.Just now we're in the ""It's their Brain Chemistry"" phase where autistic children are medicated as a matter of course, even though there is no empirical data, and I really mean no empirical data, to show efficacy of any medication for the treatment of autism. The authors don't cover this area of current controversy but I think that's fair given that this is a history of autism, not a study of current 'best practices.'After reading all these things that I used to think were ok, or at least had some basis in fact, I'm feeling shaken. I'm coming away from the book with a renewed understanding of the way my current thinking about, well, probably about anything, is made up of things I've heard or read that have very flimsy connections with reality. A particularly sobering message in this book is how the ""autism epidemic"" -- the abrupt rise in diagnoses over the past two decades -- takes as its starting point a survey conducted by just ONE guy in Great Britain, who decided to draw a line somewhere on a list of children, knowing how arbitrary his judgment was and wanting to only capture the most severe of severe cases...and his guess about what ""autism"" was, and how many children he found in that one study who fit the description, became the base percentage from which all other estimates of the apparent rise in autism are based.So if nothing else this book will make me wonder with more presence of mind where the data come from in any of the statistical 'facts' published in news stories about the topic du jour.Although it's a long book it reads easily and if anything I felt rushed through many topics rather than bogged down by too much information. Some of the things I learned didn't shock me--for instance, I learned how egos of a few men looking to make a name for themselves in the history of psychiatry managed to harm children and their families over and over again with unsubstantiated theories and destructive therapies. Some things did shock me--I was stunned to learn that until the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1975, any child that a given school district deemed ""unteachable"" could be sent home for life, or institutionalized if parents couldn't afford to care for them at home...no one gave a second thought to it. No one believed these children had a right to education. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in not just autism but human rights, child development, the history of psychiatry, and public policy."
1,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/402584-teresa,4,"""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism"". The same applies to books about autism.I've read lots of books related to autism, from fiction with quirky protagonists with autistic traits to handbooks written by specialists and memoirs and guides from those on the autistic spectrum. All of them have helped in different ways with how I deal with the challenges autism presents me with on a daily basis.This is the first, ""definitive"" story of autism I have encountered and initially, its very size was daunting. However, it turned out to be an immensely readable and interesting tome. Focused on the history of autism in the US, it's not a guide to autism, it doesn't provide any answers, it wouldn't be a recommended read for those starting on the autism ""journey"" but, for me, 10 years down the line, it was a very thought-provoking read.Just as there are many different facets to autism and its wide and varied spectrum likewise there are so many views on possible causes of autism, suitable treatments or indeed if we should take the view that treatment is desirable in an age of neurodiversity. Autism is an emotive subject and the authors have done well to tread a balanced path through its history including discredited theories, opposing support groups and charities at loggerheads with each other.There is also hope and optimism here by recording the progress made in securing meaningful education for autistic children who were once abandoned in mental institutions. There are interesting anecdotes about autistic individuals including the story of Donald Triplett, the first person to be diagnosed with autism back in 1943. Some people are focussed on finding the causes of autism, others searching for a cure but perhaps the most important thing is to raise awareness of autism and even though the primary focus of this book is the US experience of autism, it provides a great deal of insight into a lifelong disorder which affects many families worldwide."

The way a lot of non-autistic people look at autism is different than how autistic people look at it. Like they may consider stuff like ABA to be useful and helpful while autistic adults who went through it report PTSD from it. They see things like stimming as bad habits that need to be stopped, but autistic people find it comforting. Or lack of eye contact equals not listening to the person or being in their own world while a lot of autistic people say it's difficult and painful.In other words, there's no point in looking at autism ONLY from the perspective of parents and so-called experts who have no idea what it feels like to be autistic. Who won't listen to autistic people about what we want to call ourselves.I don't know. Neurotribes is looking better to me. I'll read that first because what I'm hearing about this one is not endearing it to me at all. Autistic people are just not the things a lot of experts say they are and I should know because I'm autistic!"
3,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1309716-sarah,1,"Awful, dehumanizing book. Presents abuse, torture, even murder of disabled people as ""love"". Makes every excuse for unfit parents while demeaning and dismissing self-advocacy in all forms.You won't learn much about autism from this massive tome. But it does serve as an excellent study in narcissistic parenting. So there's that.Some Relevant Links""One consequence of Donvan and Zucker’s stigmatizing approach to autism is that, by definition, any effort to eliminate autistic traits is seen as noble and beneficial. This is where the book loses its ethical footing: by shoehorning autism into the role of villain, the authors are rejecting the sort of cautious, sensitive distinctions a subject like autism requires.""In a Different Key: One (Deeply Flawed) Story of Autism by M. Kelter""But this was only the first of numerous – too many to count – anecdotes about autistic children which described them repeatedly as odd, strange, violent, disconnected, destructive, dangerous, difficult to handle, their behaviors meaningless, their interests obsessive. [...] These are the words that Donvan and Zucker use to perpetuate a tragedy narrative that is meant to justify every horrible thing that will be done to these children by parents and professionals.""Cognitive Dissonance In A Different Key by Erin Human ""But reading the description of the exchange, I’m left with a feeling that Bell, and, by extension, the authors who carry her words, feels a strange sense of entitlement to define the public conversation on autism without interference from autistic voices. ""They seem almost scandalized that someone is disagreeing with them in public. ""One is left with the impression that an autistic person expressing a strong contrary opinion is mind-blind, whereas a researcher or parent who does so is merely passionate.""Response from Ari Ne'eman, Founder of The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network""It's distressing to watch Donvan and Zucker actively ignore the ways in which autistic self-advocates are taking the lead and changing the world for the better -- not just for the 'high functioning' autistics and neurodiversity movement leaders Zucker and Donvan ignorantly or willfully characterize as being so unlike my high-support son, but for autistic people of all ages and abilities.""When The Wrong People Write About Autism by Shannon Des Roches Rosa, Senior Editor at Thinking Person's Guide to Autism"
4,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,5,"In a Different Key: The Story of Autism by John Donvan is a fascinating review of the history of the diagnosis of autism, the rise of advocacy groups and the movement for neurodiversity. From Donald Triplett, the first child diagnoses by autism pioneer Dr. Leo Kanner to the vaccine wars, the rise of the parent advocacy groups CAN, NAAR, and Autism Speaks, to the members of the autism community, people like Temple Grandin, Donvan provides up-close examinations as well as general overviews of the history of how autism came to be seen, diagnosed, and, at this present time, one of the most discussed of psychological conditions. Donvan presents in-depth pictures of many of the people active in the autism community over the past hundred years.In a Different Key, at over 600 pages, is exhausting as well as exhaustive, but provides a tremendous amount of information about the disorder and the people who have been affected by it. The medical community's responses and involvement is described and the role of parents in forcing them to pay attention to their affected children is movingly presented. I have read a great deal recently covering similar ground (Neurotribes and the relevant chapter in Far From the Tree, both wonderful works as well) but Key provides a slightly different look at the material.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of autism, the power of parent advocacy groups, or the various treatments that have been developed to treat autism (both mainstream and fringe). It is a continuously interesting and absorbing work."
5,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2669249-rebekah,5,"At first, I was hesitant to read In A Different Key due to some of the negative reviews. Having two Autistic Nephews and one Autistic Niece, I was afraid I would personalize the abysmal care that was given to patients at the Institutions. After reading the book I can say that ignoring those reviews was the best thing I did.I think some people went into it expecting a first-person narrative, not knowing it was a historical timeline of the major milestones, from 1930’s going into 2013. Donvan and Zucker have clearly done their research and it shows. The subject of Autism and Asperger’s is such a delicate subject to approach and they did it with concern on the subject matter and approached it as delicately as one could.Are there therapies that were used that were abysmal, yes. I believe though that we need to know what was tried and the horrible aspects of it so that history will not repeat itself, in ignoring the past we are only doomed to repeat the failures in the future. The authors approach each therapy by going into the details, but not subject the reader to an overload information.The number of things I learned from In A Different Key was astounding. My family has read numerous books regarding Autism, most of them from parents, advocates, doctors and ones who are Autistic themselves. There was nothing out there that basically shows some sort of timeline in how the name Autism or Asperger’s came into play. This book has so many key points in it, even as far back as five hundred years ago, in what people called “Holy Fools”. Then moving through to 1910 when the term “Autistic Thinking” was coined by Dr. Bleuler. From there it goes through numerous other areas, like Institutions, Refrigerators Moms, LSD, the different advocacy groups formed, the development of ABA, the Epidemic of Autism, vaccines and today’s therapy.I recommend this book to everyone, including those who do not have or do not know a child affected by Autism or Asperger’s. It really has opened my eyes to how far the diagnosis has come and yet how far we have to go. "
6,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079976-ariel,5,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. I have friends with children on the spectrum, I have a family member on the spectrum, and I work in an elementary school with kids on the spectrum. I picked this book up to learn more about a condition that I encountered all of the time but besides what I had personally observed, in reality I knew very little about it. I was initially daunted by the heft of this book but after reading it I wouldn't have deleted a word. It left me wanting to know even more. Far from being dry this was an extremely easy to read book that covered any question you ever had about autism. The author told the most fascinating stories as the narritive traveled the time line from Donald Triplett, case 1, until the present day. Along the way we meet heroes (Dr. Leo Kanner) and villains (Nazis!), and people who didn't know what they were talking about and really should have just shut up. This book is an important work because we have too many people in power making decisions for the disabled that don't know what they are doing. Case in point Rosalind Osgood, the unsympathetic lady on my county school board who threatened to throw parents out of the school board meeting because she didn't like their tone. Their crime was trying to advocate for their autistic children. http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/bro... This book should be required reading for every public school teacher, principal, and policy maker. "
7,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"What is autism?You think you may know the answer, and you probably do. At least on the surface. The answer to what autism is, its history, and its divisive battles, In A Different Key offers readers a satisfying and enlightening account of the various perspectives of autism. As an educator myself and someone who works with people with autism on a daily basis, it was extremely heartening to learn so much about this 'condition' that I didn't know that I didn't know.Written by two journalists, John Donvan and Caren Zucker, the reader is at once welcomed and taken on an unexpected journey that spans hundreds of years in autism's history. I say unexpected because I was expecting the dry, academic type of writing that I thought would be associated with a story on autism. Instead, I was greeted with narratives that pulled me in and kept me along for the ride. As the narrative unfurled, I began to see how key players in the world of autism showed up in one another's lives and played integral roles to the development of both causes and debates.Although a bit lengthy, it reads much quicker than one might anticipate due to its readability. As the conversations about what autism is, what causes it, and whether it should be cured are still going on, this is not a encapsulated history. It does catch the reader up to speed up until present day 2015, while acknowledging that there is continued hope for progress in the arena. As awareness of neurodiversity expands in the public sphere, it is ever more important for everyone to understand the story of autism.**I received an uncorrected proof of the book from LibraryThing's Early Reviewers program.**"
8,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49249828-lp1989,2,"NB: I am reviewing this at the same time as Neurotribes and will occasionally be drawing comparisons. IADK compared to NT is well meaning enough but suffers from a simplistic premise - namely the fact that the authors are working from a medical model of ASC with an emphasis on parental advocacy and biomedical intervention - often with the aim of producing genetic markers to allow for pre natal screening - at the expense of the viewpoint of autistic adults, self-advocacy, and the social model of ASC. The end result is something that is not only very demeaning and patronizing to those on the spectrum (whatever their level of support needs, age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status), but also perpetuates a number of harmful stereotypes - ones that ultimately harm those that they claim to support and is actually detrimental to parental and family advocacy as well. The root of this, I think based on what I have read in interviews that Donovan and Zucker have family members who are Autistic and this is the approach that is the most natural to them (Donvan's brother inn law and Zucker's son Respectvely). They're also critical of Neurodiversity and the perception that its detrimental to more high Support autistics as they ""can't speak for themselves"" and that it downplays challenges and problems of High Needs Autistics, as well as criticism of the spectrum concept, which may explain the attacks on Hans Asperger compared to the relatively indulgent treatment of Leo Kanner and Ivor Lovaas (see below). ND has its flaws and there should be nothing wrong with constructive debate and exchange of ideas; this does not, however justify insulting people like Jim Sinclair and Ari Ne'eman along with whitewashing the very real ethical problems of programs like ABA. Ultimately, intentionally or otherwise, IADK is an apologia for misguided and often downright harmful interventions - and in some cases murder, in the name of ""love"" and ""normalization"" (don't be me started on the manipulative language in this book) D&Z needed to give their book a point of difference from the (superior) NT that was released a year earlier. NT also has its problems but was widely praised for a good reason. It was a genuinely new and fresh take on ASC, one that was hopeful and respectful and placed autistic people themselves as the main voice. It also uncovered some important parts of the history of the creation of the diagnostic category, namely the fact that two of Asperger's clinicians, Georg Frankl and Anni Weiss, also worked for Kanner in his clinic at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore. Kanner in fact had helped Frankl and Weiss (Frankl was Jewish, Weiss Gentile - married couple) leave Austria after the Nazi's took over. Traditionally Kanner and Asperger were said to be working independently and were simply looking at different forms of ASC - the fact there was a link between the two can't be overstated as it raises a LOT of questions about Kanner, his approach and motivations. Questions D&Z don't feel compelled to answer. This brings me to my biggest issue with the book - about just what Hans Asperger did in the war. Relying on the work of Herwig Czech, who still refuses to make his work public and refused repeated requests from Silberman to share his work and has a long history of ""gotcha"" style allegations about figures from this period, claims that HA was a Nazi sympathizer and enthusiastic eugenist. Zucker is Jewish and has admitted in interviews that this colors her perception of HA and his work, as it also did for people like LK and Eric Scholper, which had long term impact on ASC and its diagnostic broadness. However, Silberman is also Jewish and his view of HA is very different. Overall the allegations feel sensationalized, lack historical context, and smack of a certain self righteousness that one often sees from Americans (especially those from Jewish backgrounds) regarding Nazi Germany and those who lived under that regime. Until Czech puts his work in the public domain I'm going to reserve judgement. D&Z do cite NT in their notes and bibliography but fail to mention the stuff about Frankl, or make an honest attempt to rebut Silberman's argument - they just ignore it. If you had not read NT prior to reading IADK, the failure to mention this is deeply misleading and dishonest. Shame on you D&Z! Honestly given their stated skepticism about autism as a spectrum condition and ND - both of which derive more from HA's conception of Autism as common, variable lifelong and organic; and not the (initial) view LK had of Autism as monolithic, confined to childhood and a toxic byproduct of modernity, I would not be surprised if by overplaying the allegations about HA's actions during the war, they were unconsciously trying to more broadly discredit the concepts and implications associated with HA's view of Autism - hmm? On top of that, its too US centric and missing a lot about the policies of diagnosis esp regarding social background, the under-diagnosis of girls and women and the frequent misdiagnosis of people of color. (NT had similar problems but that was a space issue and Silberman often alludes to it in the book and interviews - D&Z just ignore it). Most of the science they cite is outdated or wrong It's well organised and easy to read and is well documented with a good bibliography. IADK is a good starting point for further work on the history and politics of ASC but for those wanting a History 101 of ASC that gives better insight into the experience of being autistic Neurotribes is a better book. That said, IADK has a lot of good information about parental advocacy and the politics of the psychological profession about ASC. Its also an unintentional insight into the mindset of the parental advocates and in particular the sensitivity and knee jerk animosity many seem to feel when challenged by the self-advocates. When Jim Sinclair's ""Don't Mourn For Us"" gets dismissed as a rehash of refrigerator mothering and the authors complain of the fact that Sinclair isn't a parent of an autistic child and thus not in the position to understand the challenges they face - despite the fact that Sinclair themself is Autistic - says everything. Much of this has to do with the long baleful influence of the 'refrigerator mother' hypothesis, the stigmatized nature of the term Autism, the persistent erasure of Autistic adults in media and research, and unexamined assumptions about being 'normal'. If you want to know why so many went (and still do) go along with the anti vaccination theory and other bogus claims - this will tell you why. This is why I did not give this one star - in spite of itself it still has some value."
9,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36508945-matthew-henken,1,"Ugh. I was looking forward to reading this very much. I am interested in autism as a psychological, medical, and social phenomenon and the reviews for this book have been outstanding. I was extremely disappointed in this book. The writing as a mechanical matter was fine, but the book read like a (vastly) extended magazine article of the middling sort. It narrates event after event and dispute after dispute without (seemingly) any interest in probing beneath the surface or considering the hard questions. For example, there are many discussions of parents and governments disputing over who will pay for the provision of services to their children. The story is told from the parents' point of view that the government doesn't give money either because they are stingy or because they don't understand how much help they need. The book, however, doesn't even ask about the other priorities of those government agencies have been directed to follow and certainly doesn't provide an opportunity for government representatives to explain how it would affect their ability to serve other social priorities if they provided to parents of autistic children all the services they believe their children need. I'm more interested in the rights and wrongs and the conflicting interests leading to the winning and the losing in the contest, not just who is winning and losing in the quest for funds. The book, however, really has nothing to say about this topic that takes up maybe half the book.As another example, in the discussion of ""neurodiversity"" a movement spearheaded by some very articulate people at the far end of the autism spectrum who believe that autism is a core part of their identity and thus resist the search for a ""cure"" as an effort to erase them and their ""kind."" Again, this book primarily adopts the point of view of the parents of children with much more severe handicaps as a result of their autism and notes that the neurodiversity position is much easier to believe in when you are an autistic person who is also college educated, highly articulate, and professionally successful. What a fascinating clash of viewpoints! It sure would be nice if this book would have actually delved into this clash, put this response to the neurodiversity proponents and let them respond so we could get a sense of the real meaning of this dispute. But, alas, this book is (as always) content to point out that there are these opposing camps without providing any substance.Finally, this book provides no insight whatever into what autism is like from the inside. It doesn't even ask the question. Insight into psychological conditions not shared by the reader are often difficult to gain and communicate, but terrific books like Noonday Demon (about depression) can communicate a truly harrowing sense of what it is like to be depressed. That's what makes psychological conditions so very interesting: What it's like to be autistic is different from what it's like to be neurotypical. But in what way? How do the interactions of people look to you if you are autistic. What are the things that stress you out about being with other people? What is the soothing you get from repetitive motions or memorizing the details of something you're interested in? These are the questions that recognize that autistic people are *people* who have rich inner lives we want to understand. But the book shows no interest in helping us understand the human, internal situation of the people who are the subject of this 700 page book. Why not?  "
10,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3356446-carol,5,"I made a difficult decision when I decided to read In A Different Key: The Story of Autism by John Donovan and Caren Zucher . My brother is severely autistic. He was born in 1955 when I was nine. I am going to do this review in a very personal way, through my own experiences. The authors started this history of autism with the first boy diagnosed with it. That boy, Donald Triplett had well educated parents, like mine but they were wealthy unlike mine. The biggest difference outside of the fact that they could afford to try anything to help their child was that he was born in a time when there wasn't even a name for it. They realized that he was different, many of his behaviors were my brothers. But my brother and others had the unfortunate luck to be born in 1955. He was taken to many doctors and had many tests. The worst was that when Dr. Bruno Bettelheim (his doctorate was in art history) came up with his theories which were not based on science at all. I vividly remember the day that my father, a doctor and my mother, a teacher, returned home from a doctor's appointment. That is when their doctor broke the news to my mother and father that instead of being the warm and sweet mother that I knew, she was a ""cold refrigerator mother"". I vividly remember her fleeing from the front door, tears pouring down her face to the kitchen. When my told me what the doctor had said, I knew that there was no way that it could be true! Through the years, I have kept up, reading many of the books referred to in this book. I remember the vaccine controversy, and loved Temple Grandlin's books. I remember that my mother was at the signing ceremony when the governor of our state signed the bill that my brother, and others like him, could not be excluded from school because he is autistic. I wish that my brother had been born to rich parents so he could have the best opportunities available. Donald Triplett was still autistic when he died but he died a happy man. My brother is only happy once in a great while. If you have a relative who is autistic, please read this book. I received a finished copy of this book as a win from FirstReads from the publisher but that in no way determined my thoughts or feelings in this review."
11,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35695870-jessica,5,"I feel I must give the warning that the way most of the population with autism, and most people with mental disabilities, have been treated in the past was awful until recently. This book is about that history. We have come a long way from what used to common in terms of care and treatment of this population, we still must continue to move forward. In order to do so I feel it necessary to learn the history. This is a great place to start. This is respectfully told, as respectful as possible considering the horrors of the past. There is a lot to be learned here. Much of the population that has experienced these things are still around, this helps to understand the reasoning behind so much of what I experience when working with my older individuals at work. I really like that this big book was not filled with a ton of medical information.  I really recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject."
12,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51930427-mary,5,"This book is an absolute marvel. It does for autism what ""The Emperor of All Maladies"" did for cancer--it's essentially a biography of this disease (can we even call it that?) that has befuddled people for going on a century now. This is not an easy read: though exceptionally well-written, it is dense, and the players--both the doctors and the families--are plentiful and easy to get mixed up. (The chronology at the end serves as a nice summary/reminder--that was a great touch.) I'm wondering if people who aren't so intimately connected to autism would have the same patience I did to read (listen), constantly enthralled, peeling away the social and medical and public health layers of this topic that has generated so much debate and so much vitriol from all sides. I nearly cried several times reading the section about the development of ABA therapy. Again--would these stories be as impactful to people who have NOT, as I have, witnessed first-hand the miracle of this therapy in their children or loved ones? So much of this book--the struggles between parents and teachers/daycare providers, the overall lack of knowledge of pediatricians who can (and should) be the parents' best advocates in early detection and testing, the day-to-day, fight-to-the-death battle autism parents wage to help their children be included in a society that is stacked against them in every way--resonated with me so strongly. I'm too close to the subject matter to be able to say, objectively, that this book will be moving and affecting to others in the same way that it was to me. The authors leave no stone unturned, diving into every nook and cranny of this disease with measured, balanced reporting. (The later chapters about vaccines and the more recent neurodiversity movement were particularly illuminating, as they reflect and make sense of so much of what's happening around us currently.) But I loved every page of this book, and I'm grateful for the way in which it serves to so thoroughly, and so decently, unpack a condition that is so fraught for so many people."
13,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2868062-haley-keller,2,"This book had it's good points, but those were overshadowed by its problems.The book shares many stories of families who have a child diagnosed with autism. Notice that I said families and not stories about autistic children. In many of the stories within the book, I noticed that there was a heavy focus on the emotions that the parents of the autistic child were feeling and very little said about the autistic child's own feelings. This is probably something many people wouldn't notice, but I was watching carefully to see how these stories would be presented precisely because of something that annoys me frequently (and that I've heard autistic people themselves cite as a problem): There seems to be far more focus on how the families of autistic children feel than there is on how the autistic children themselves feel.None of that is to say that the families' emotions aren't important as well. It's the noticeable lack of a focus on the autistic children that worries me. Because of the nature of autism, I understand that the children's emotions are seen as difficult to understand, but if anything, that makes trying to do so more important. The impression that constantly discussing family members' emotions and not the autistic person's creates is a sense that the autistic person is either not feeling anything at all (a dangerous stereotype) or that their feelings are unimportant.Because of this same focus, there is little said about why autistic kids behave the way they do despite this being an entire book devoted to autism. You can read this entire book and see how autistic children act but still not understand why they behave that way. There's little to no effort made to explore what is happening in an autistic person's mind, how they are interpreting the world, and, therefore, why they are acting in certain ways. Instead, you only get the shallow surface level of, ""Here are stereotypical behaviors of autism. Who knows the actual source of these behaviors?""(Also, yes, I'm using identity-first language in this review because that's the language preferred by many autistic people themselves. The argument for identity-first language also makes more sense to me. The book uses person-first language in case you were wondering. For more on what I'm talking about, I'll point you to the Autistic Self Advocacy Network.)There is a part of the book that describes the story of a father killing his autistic son. It unnerved me how the book discussed this. The father is described as a sympathetic character who was trying to help his child, and the book actually takes on an ""any parent with an autistic child would understand his decision from an emotional standpoint"" tone that's disturbing.Towards the end of the book, there is some discussion of the neurodiversity movement, but there is never anything said about what the movement actually is. All you'd really know after reading is that autistic people themselves lead the movement and parents of autistic kids typically don't like it. Essentially, that's all you're given. There could have been a much deeper exploration of the topic, especially since it's such a big one right now. This is especially frustrating considering the amount of pages given to the anti-vaccine crowd when their point-of-view holds no water. (The book doesn't defend the vaccine argument. I'm merely complaining here about the amount of pages given to vaccines versus neurodiversity.)What bothered me more than anything else in the neurodiversity section, though, was something said about an autistic person and advocate within the neurodiversity movement. The book tells the story of the mom of an autistic child confronting an autistic person. (This story is told from the mom's point-of-view because, as I've said, the book doesn't like to get into autistic people's heads and get things from their point-of-view.) The mom doesn't agree with the neurodiversity movement, so she the autistic person. We're not given any specifics about what they say to each other, just that they both describe their own beliefs.What we are given is the mother's thoughts on the autistic person after they speak. She dismisses his entire argument because she believes that he lacks empathy. This angered me for a number of reasons. For one, there are plenty of autistic people who will insist that they do feel empathy; the difference is that they don't express it in the ways non-autistic people do.In addition to that, this section of the book is the closest we get to hearing an autistic person's own view on autism, and we don't actually hear anything about their view. We just have their view dismissed because they ""lack empathy"". Since this is widely considered an autistic trait, it's incredibly convenient if you can dismiss anything an autistic person says because they ""lack empathy"". In fact, it seemed to me to be utterly lacking in empathy to dismiss someone's argument in such a way. It gives all non-autistic people the license to never listen to autistic people and that is a worrying road to go down (but also one that we seem to already be on).Of course, as this is a book about autism, Autism Speaks is discussed. While the book doesn't present Autism Speaks in an entirely positive light, they also don't go into all of the controversy surrounding Autism Speaks, only a very small portion of it. Because of that, I don't believe many people reading this who don't know just what is wrong with Autism Speaks would actually understand the issue after reading this book. This is another area where the book would have greatly benefited from focusing more on what autistic people themselves have to say as there is such vocal opposition to Autism Speaks within the autistic community. (Receiving the amount of backlash towards your organization from the very community you're supposedly helping as Autism Speaks receives from the autistic community is never a good sign.)Overall, this book gave me the same impression that a lot of mainstream autism activism gives me: They are far more focused on the non-autistic people who are around autistic people than on autistic people themselves. The book would have benefited from trying to look at autistic peoples' experiences instead of just their families' experiences, trying to understand why autistic people act the way they do, and actually sharing what autistic people have to say, not just what their parents have to say.I received this book in exchange for an honest review through Blogging for Books."

I'm not a psychologist, not an autism expert of any kind, just an interested individual with extended family members on the autism spectrum. So when this hefty book arrived, I worried about being swamped with medical jargon and dry discussions of research papers. It turned out to be a very readable book focused on the human face of autism, with stories of the patients, families, doctors and others involved in autism diagnosis and treatment since the 1930s. From my layperson viewpoint, it was engaging, educational and often touching. "
15,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6410286-brittany,5,"What a tome of a book. The research that went into this book is deserving of like 26 stars, so I can't fault the authors on that point. Ultimately, this was a very interesting read on the history of autism that is interspersed with personal stories of people with autism or people who are affected by it. It's a great (if very long) read if you're interested in the subject matter.[Edit] I'm changing my review from four stars to five stars. I've thought about this book a lot since reading it, which is a common hallmark of books I was too harsh on when rating them."

refrigerator mothers.
 It took advocates who shared what their inner worlds were liked to lead the fight for equality for Americans with Autism and those dedicated Americans fought the politicians, the medical profession, and school boards to win rights for Americans who live with Autism.In A Different Key The Story of Autism Is about the history of autism from 1848 to 2013 and the breakthrough discoveries. In A Different Key The Story of Autism is not only an essential read for parents raising a child with autism but for everyone who is interested in allaying their ignorance on the subject of autism.I was really shaken over how politicians would allow the scientific and medical communities to treat children with autism and their families. In A Different Key The Story of Autism demonstrates clearly how the medical profession can get things all wrong. They referred to the children as being defective and doctors encouraged parents to be ashamed of their children and to place them in institutions not considering the emotional feelings of the children because they were defective and a menace to society.Quotes--The American public is taxed, heavily taxed, to maintain an increasing race of morons, which threatens the very foundations of our civilization—Margaret Sanger--Nature’s mistakes deserved relief from the burden of a life “that at no time can produce anything good at all.” –Robert Foster Kennedy, neurologist who also argued for painless methods of killing and spelled out a careful selection process--The fact that a child comes into the world as a Negro does in no way serve as a barometer for his intellectual potentialities –Leo Kanner, child psychiatrist, Johns Hopkins who discovered autismIn A Different Key The Story of Autism was an easy read and should be a required read."

19,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4814399-judy-lesley,5,"It would be difficult for me to give this incredible accumulation of information any rating other than five stars. Autism has only touched my family in ways which haven't helped me understand what it truly entailed. One of my daughters is a school teacher and the other works with juveniles involved in the court system so I've heard their experiences with children with autism and yet even that didn't give me the full background I was searching for. This book does.Taking on the story of autism has to have been a daunting experience for John Donvan and Caren Zucker because, as shown by the facts in this book, the facts have been a long time in getting to the knowledge we have today about the condition. Simply reading this book requires a commitment from the reader because even though it is well presented, it is still not an easy story to tell. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing to the present I found out the history of autism itself while still not understanding exactly what it is. That single element in the way this story is told gave me just a tiny glimpse into how frustrated and bewildered parents must have been to see their child exhibit signs of something being profoundly wrong. We tend to expect medical miracles to be pulled out of hats. Not only were there no miracles for families with autistic children but there were also very vew people who were trying to find answers to questions concerning the disorder.One of the things most impressive to me was the decision of the authors to keep the autism story centered on people instead of making it about statistics and numbers and graphs and charts. Often those elements have a tendency to dehumanize whatever subject is being discussed. With The Story of Autism you will always be reading about those with the diagnosis, about the parents, about the doctors, about the activists, or about the researchers. And even if numbers and statistics come into play in the telling of the story it is usually to show you how misleading and unhelpful those very numbers and statistics can be. Something which came in very handy for me is the timeline for autism which is included in the back of the book. This story is one that necessarily moves backward and forward in time constantly, turning and twisting upon itself in order to explain why a pronouncement was considered so important and how a conclusion was reached. After reading this book I feel I have a very fair representation of the condition called autism and where this story stands today. Where it will go tomorrow, I don't know."
20,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22279391-kara,2,"In a Different Key: The Story of Autism is an incredibly detailed history of the activism of parents of autistic children and adults to increase the resources available in our society for those affected as well as educating the public about this spectrum of conditions. However, a significant weakness of this work was the focus on the struggle of parents of the autistic at the expense of a focus on the activism and perspective of autistic people themselves. Frankly, I found this disparity very disturbing and would refrain from recommending this book to other readers on this ground. Please be advised I received a copy of this book from the Reading Room Giveaway program in exchange for posting this honest review."
21,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7547539-vyl-n,4,"'In a Different Key' could simply be titled 'The History of Autism'. It is informative and extensive and easy to comprehend.The book doesn't cover every topic to ever have been associated with autism but it properly answers the following questions among other things:* What is and used to be defined as autism;* How it was treated by the professionals and how that has been changing since the first diagnosis;* How it was perceived by the general public and how that has been changing;* Why autism wasn't being diagnosed earlier than 1943;* Why autism is diagnosed more and more often;* What's the deal with the vaccine scare and the epidemic scare;* Why it is called a spectrum and not a single diagnosis;* Why certain practices hailed miraculous in the past are no longer used.The only downside for me was the author choosing to play the emotional angle quite often instead of presenting plain facts. The bits looked a lot like those inserts in tv documentaries where actors are trying to reconstruct some events. I know it was probably meant to break the monotony. But considering bits like this ""It was probably a nice day. They may have been sitting at the kitchen table. She probably looked out the window thinking it was a nice day day when the phone call came to change her life forever. Her heart probably sank before even picking up the phone""  were thrown in out of sync with the rest of the storytelling; it served more as an annoyance.The most important thing to take away from this book is not who did which research or who raised awareness in what way but the understanding that autistic people are important and have dignity and deserve to be treated like any other human being, the ideas that sometimes are forgotten even nowadays.I hope it will help me and others stay more skeptical of the ways the disorder is portrayed in the media and less judgmental of autistic people. I personally thought I wasn't judgmental but this book shone the light on my thinking in stereotypes more often than I could have expected."
22,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27301677-meghan,4,"Over the decades the way we, as society, have looked at autism has changed. From being a big shame, blaming the mother, to people thinking vaccines caused autism, and everything in between this book tackles it. Starting in the 1930s all the way up to today’s age this has shown how autism has fit, and at times hasn’t fit, into society. This was an eye opening account of the ins and outs to autism. The way the facts were laid out was done nicely. It followed a chronological order and the reader can tell that the authors did their research and that they have a bit of a soft spot for autism. The facts were presented very well and coming from journalists they were able to make it so the reader was never confused or overwhelmed. The small antidotes they used of families throughout was a beautiful personal touch and the fact they were used all throughout the book made it feel like the reader grew with them. This was a fascinating read, although predominately American, they do touch on other countries, it was still an engaging read. "
23,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9076231-renee,5,"Everyone should read this book. This is a history, that is our history and needs to be understood. Donovan and Zucker have written a history of Autism that is broad in its scope, using personal stories, early records and the work of the pioneers in this field of study. To read this book is to better understand the complex issues surrounding autism, where the diagnoses came from and how. This is an essential work concerning the treatment of others, and how society defines those who are or seem different. The authors bring forward the various arguments surrounding autism and what it means to be on the spectrum. To read this is to have a new, broader concept of neurodiversity and how we each fit into and on the spectrum - this is about our human diversity, our human frailty, our foolishness and our compassion - this is a forward leaning book and a missing part of the ongoing conversations concerning autism. An exquisite work, well written, well researched, scientific and still accessible. A must read."
24,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57568576-alice-lemon,4,"My feelings on this book are...complicated. Donvan and Zucker definitely write from a position of some concerning unexamined biases in favor of autism parents, against the neurodiversity movement, and and in favor of eradicating autistic traits to make children more normal. This is definitely a book that needs to be read with several grains of salt. That said, it's also a book that goes into an incredible amount of detail about the history of the autism parents' movement, and of the early medical and legal treatment of autistic people, so I felt it was very useful for context, even if I was very upset about how it handled some things.http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2016/01/in-different-key-one-deeply-flawed.html is a good discussion of some of the problems with this book, and definitely worth reading as you read In a Different Key."
25,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75900898-ivy,5,"In addition to chronicling the the story of how autism is perceived by society, it also tells the history of tension between the experts and the non-experts. Without parents who are willing to challenge those in authoritative positions, autistic children were perceived as idiots unworthy of education, to be locked away in institutions. Yet the same parents, in their zeal to advocate for their children, were quick to believe in unscientific theories that resulted in the community wasting its resources in continuously disproving the vaccine theory. This is a story that goes beyond autism... it is a story about how activists can change public perception... and an important reminder that we should make educated decisions as our nation continue to disregard the opinions of experts."
26,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/692475-patrick,5,"My son has non-verbal autism, so I spend a lot of time thinking about what life must feel like for him. I once did an empathetic experiment with my daughter, who is only a year older than my son, to try and help her understand how hard things are for him. She had to go one hour without speaking, and only use non-verbal cues to help me understand what she was thinking and feeling. She made it less than 10 minutes before she broke down in tears, saying it was too hard and frustrating. My son obviously doesn't have that option.And yet, you'd be hard-pressed to find a happier, more delightful kid. He finds joy in everything, and he lives his life to the fullest every day. He lives in the moment, and takes immense pleasure in the mundanity of every day life. Every time he eats his favorite foods, it's like he's tasting them for the first time. Every time he watches a Yo Gabba Gabba cartoon, he smiles, laughs, and jumps around like it's the best thing he's ever seen, regardless of how many hundreds of times he's seen it already. He has a natural joie de vivre that I genuinely admire and strive for in my own life. As corny as it sounds, he really is my hero, and if he wasn't autistic, I don't know who he would be. But he wouldn't be the son that I love and admire.But autism is still such a mystery, even to those of us who deal with it in some way on a daily basis. So for that reason, I was on-board with this book. It gives a painstakingly detailed, balanced view of exactly what it purports - a history of our understanding of autism over the last 100 years or so. Donovan does a great job sticking to the facts while also presenting the stories of many of the prominent and/or interesting people who have played large roles in autism research and awareness over the years. I was stunned by how little I knew.I've seen some reviews on here from people on the spectrum who bailed on the book early because it felt biased, treating autism as a 'disease' that needed to be cured. I can understand how hurtful that could feel to someone like my son, and I empathize with that feeling. But, in fairness to Donovan, he actually does a great job of highlighting the more recent spectrum pride movements and always treats the subject matter with a journalistic integrity. The truth is, when it was first recognized, autism was even less well-understood, and there wasn't much to have pride in. It was hard for both the people diagnosed with it and the parents and family member as well. It was heartbreaking to read in detail the struggles of the families dealing with autism in the early days. The story of the father who ""mercy"" killed his son before committing suicide was particularly painful, but it was truly a different time and a uniquely different challenge. I empathized with everyone involved, and consider myself incredibly fortunate to be taking this journey with my family in the 21st century.It's not an easy read. It can be dense at times, though not through any fault of Donovan, who does an incredible job breaking down what can be complex medical research. But there's a lot of data, a lot of names and organizations to keep track of, a lot of moving pieces. But that density is also what makes it so compelling. Even if I only retain a fraction of the information I learned in this book, I'm going to be more knowledgeable about a subject that is meaningful to me, and a better advocate for my son. I'm very glad to have read it and recommend it for any parent, family member, or friend of someone on the spectrum."
27,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby,5,"Totally riveting. I flew through this massive book, which is a history of how autism was given a name and how that name — and the development of the autism spectrum and what that diagnosis entails — has shifted, and continues to shift, from the 1940s to the present. That's the key takeaway: None of this is finished. This is not a definitive history. The authors betray their broadcast journalism roots sometimes (ending almost every chapter's final paragraph with a predictable ""hook""), but it worked on me; I read hungrily from chapter to chapter. I'll admit that I harbored a good deal of fear about autism (and receiving that diagnosis for a potential child), but a lot of that misinformation I was carrying was been addressed by the thoroughness of this book. And while there is still a good deal of fear and grief that confronts every parent whose child receives this diagnosis, there is so much more support and hope now than there ever has been — thanks, largely, to tenacious mothers and the scientists they persuaded to get involved."
28,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795256-marie-smith,5,"This book wonderfully describes the history of understanding autism (associated cultural attitudes and what was learned through scientific research), beginning roughly in the 1940s. It is a nearly 500-page page turner. "
29,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600090-kathryn,4,"This was a fascinating book. The growth in medicine, the growth in diagnosing any type of health issues is so interesting.

30,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5278073-erin-schmidt,4,"I enjoy good writing about science topics, and I'm especially interested in books that explore the scientific and social history of medical conditions. This book hit all the right notes with me. It explored the topic of autism from the first modern diagnosis onward, then went back and looked at what could be historical examples of individuals with undiagnosed autism. Lest you think this book is nothing but dry scientific facts, however, please note that the authors have done an excellent job of humanizing the condition of autism. In the final analysis, this is the story of people, from young Donald Triplett (actually he's going to turn 84 this year, but when we meet him in the book, his mother is pregnant with him) to the famous Temple Grandin. We meet parents of children with autism, the good, the bad, and the ugly. (And I do mean ugly - there's a case of a parent who murdered his autistic child in a misguided act of ""mercy killing."") This is a fascinating read, and more importantly, it's a reminder that autistic and ""neurotypical"" people alike can work together to improve education and quality of life for children and adults with autism. "
31,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The best biographies (or histories) are those which transcend the story that is being told. One does not even have to be interested in Autism to appreciate fully what the authors have done with this book. The arc of the story is tied together by how our understanding of the nature of Autism has changed from its early days until today and how complex it is to do science right.The authors usually tell their history by focusing on particular characters and put them into the context of the time period. The science of the times at first (psychoanlytical theories) blame the moms ('refrigerator moms"") or next with the behaviorist use 'cattle prods"" or slapping for dealing with the autistic children. The moms (and dads) are some of the real heroes. They realized that the status quo was not acceptable and not effective. Pre-internet days they did what they could and organized and made a difference. Sometimes, we lose sight of the fact how important individuals can be in changing the accepted scientific norms. Kindness, understanding and patience turned out to be more effective strategies.The labels (the definitions) we give determine how we understand. The authors step the listener through many different ways we thought about Autism and by doing that the listener gets a good understanding of what Autism means. I even understand why the DSM V has dropped the Asperger category and why it's best thought of as part of the Autism Spectrum. The authors are always neutral in their reporting of the facts and let the science speak for itself. They cover in detail why vaccines do not cause Autism, why some people can reasonably think about Autism as neurdiverse (v. neurotypical), and why there is probably no epidemic in the growth of Autism, and how important it was to educate the public about the reality of Autism through all means possible.The book gives a good perspective on how and why we think about Autism the way we do today, and how science can be fluid but seems to have a self correcting mechanism (albeit sometimes acting at a snails pace) within it, and how individuals do make a difference even when they are not part of the scientific tribe. "
32,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6039463-sarah,5,"This is such a comprehensive book that it's hard to describe. I would compare it to The Emperor of All Maladies: a biography of cancer- like that book, this is both informative and devastating. It starts with the earliest cases of what would become known as autism and describes the parents' efforts to get their children diagnosed and treated, the medical/psychiatric community's efforts to understand and describe the condition, and the way that autistic people were viewed and treated, from the early 20th century up to today. It's not a difficult read in that it's well-written and, while you can tell it's exhaustively researched, the author does an excellent job of making a large amount of complex information very accessible and interesting. But it is a difficult read in that it forces the reader to grapple emotionally with the history of how intellectually challenged people of all stripes were treated throughout history, the way that early understandings of autism placed the blame squarely upon mothers, and the reality of living with autism. I learned a LOT and am glad I read it, but it was tough going at times and I sometimes had to leave it for a little bit because it was upsetting. Overall I'd recommend it to anyone interested in autism- or even if you're not specifically interested in it, it's an excellent book for anyone who likes non-fiction, especially history. It's engrossing, well-researched, and well-written. It's quite up-to-date and current up till the 2010's. "
33,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7201754-wanda,5,"It was no surprise to read in the 'About the Authors' section at the end of the book that they each have a family member in the autism spectrum. This is clearly written from inside the camp and it's very well written at that. The scope of the book ranges from an overview of autism, its history, diagnoses, treatments, and advocacy to intimate profiles of individuals on the spectrum and their families. And it's those profiles that stand out with stories that focus on the person and not on their diagnostic label. I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to autism but instead as a resource for anyone wanting to expand their knowledge about neurodiversity and how we came to be where we are in understanding it.I received this book for free through Goodreads Giveaways."

37,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,5," I picked up this book as I was curious and wanted to know more about autism and I was not at all disappointed.This one is about the many people involved in autism- the doctors, the parents and the patients themselves. The story spans over more than eighty years, mostly covering the happenings in the U.S. and England.The authors start of with the story of the first autistic child that was brought to the attention of Kanner; the psychiatrist who coined the term ‘autism’. It then moves on from there, describing how various theories floating among psychiatrists and researchers shaped the public attitude towards autism. Throughout the book one sees both kinds of examples- good instances where a new teaching technique proved useful to the autistic children and their parents cope with the disorder; and also bad theories like that of the vaccine scare which did more harm than good. As one reads on in the book, one realises that this story does not have one hero, neither are there any bad guys of the traditional sense. Even those that caused harm had good will at their hearts, most of the time. One also comes to realise how important it is to accept theories and alternative therapies only when backed up by concrete and scientific results- this lesson creeps up again and again throughout the book- in the refrigerator mother theory, with the facilitated communication etc. Although there are many heroes in this narrative, a large part of them are parents of autistic children, driven into action to help their own and other children like them. These driven parents formed the first societies and help groups as well formed some early groups to fund autism research. Towards the end of the book and the turn of the century, the autistic people themselves took over the stage to voice their opinions about ongoing research and policies. We have indeed come a long way from the day the disorder was first described and named.I really liked the way the authors have put together the whole chain of events, which are as complicated as the disorder itself is. They have managed to bring out the highlights of each era and described each scenario perfectly. The writing style is quite engaging; largely because of the moving personal accounts that bring the point home. By the end of it, I was left with a greater understanding of the struggles the autistic people go through and also a heightened appreciation for autism research. This book is a must for anyone interested in knowing more about autism itself."
38,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49514162-warren-mayocchi,3,"Considerably less than the tag line - ""The Story of Autism"" - but still a reasonably well written exploration of autism from the constraining perspective of an American. Most (perhaps all) of the social policy, law, and so on is USA all the way. International viewpoints are given some space, but only in the context of the American story. For example, Leo Kanner's specific ideas about autism are celebrated and discussed at length, starting with his first case study. The following American discovery process continues for the first half of the book (it does have what is effectively a sidenote to state that autism existed before Kanner found it). Halfway through the book the overseas developments had become loud enough to warrant a section. It is here we are introduced to Hans Asperger, but the text is largely concerned with whether he was a Nazi. Before and after this mention Asperger seems to be have been strangely dismissed. In general though, editorial judgement is neutral. For example, in the relating Alec Gibson's murder of his autistic child the motivations and results are presented in a way to condemn the act, but also in an attempt to understand why.Perhaps what I have written is too harsh, I liked reading the book despite the limitations. It is an interesting exploration of everything it covers. However, a much better ""story of autism"" can be found in Autism: A social and medical history by Mitzi Waltz (which is also ~300 pages shorter)."
39,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21257579-corinne-wilson,4,"If you're looking for a step by step guide to helping or interacting with someone with autism, that definitely wasn't the intent of this book. What it does do is relate the folly-ridden tale of how the public came to understand what autism is and give people with autism a place in the world. Well done audiobook, and very accessible and engaging/not dry content. The triumphs of the autism community stem from horrific beginnings: what it's like to be checked into a mental institution as a small child. The heartbreaking accounts of ""refrigerator mothers"" who were told they caused their child's autism by resenting the sleepless nights or the hours of crying the baby brought to their lives. The fad of Facilitated Communication that brought forth a false allegation of child abuse that rocked the nation and ruined the lives of all involved. The television portrayals of Elvis singing to a child and thus curing her autism by the magic of love. The ""discovery"" that children who are beaten or electrocuted have much better behavior than other autistic children. Society really sucks sometimes. From these difficult beginnings came Donald Triplett, Temple Grandin and many other people with autism who slowly shaped the choices those with autism had, and modelled lives outside institutions. Still a long way to go in the media and with people understanding what autism is like (especially outside the rare but harped on savant syndrome)."

It describes the history of our insights in autism and the way our societies dealt with autistic people.

This makes it a very lively story, sometimes even tricking you into believing something that is then later refuted. For example when he described the ''Facilitated Communication"" I first really thought that this was just so wonderful! And when I plummeted back into reality l was quite shocked to see how easily you can believe something if you desperately wish for it to be true.The book describes the extreme suffering of children and adults in institutions. And of the bullying that the socially awkward children suffered in school. All this is really heartbreaking. Then, on the other hand, there have also been loads of people who dedicated themselves to helping. This is heartwarming.What's totally clear by the end of this book, is that we are still completely baffled by autism. It's hard to find a definition that everyone agrees on, we have no idea on what causes it. Some people (especially high functioning autistic people) question if it is really a problem or just another way of being human."

I frankly didn't know much about autism but saw that it was nominated for a Pulitizer and gave it a shot. The book is well-researched and tells the story of autism, which has lots of fascinating and strange twists and turns, lots of misguided hypotheses about the nature and etiology of the disorder. I enjoyed the description of the research controversies as well the detailed descriptions of individuals affected by the disorder.This book doesn't provide any answers, but it does a great job of detailing the early history of this disorder when researchers and parents had very few answers and didn't even know the questions to ask; all the way to present day when there have been strides to understanding autism as well as significant controversies.Thank you very much to the authors for devoting what must have been a significant portion of their life to writing this book."

It's a long one (23 hours on audiobook--I listened pretty fast by the end!) but I have to say I feel like my understanding and compassion for individuals who are on the autism spectrum has grown enormously as a result, and to me, that's worth the time commitment to finish it. Throughout the book, the author shares countless stories about the day to day struggles, guilt, pain, and sheer grit of individuals and their stories. At times heartbreaking and other times heroic, I feel so much gratitude to those patient parents and teachers who keep going and see that individuals on the spectrum have just as much value as anyone else and are worth the effort it takes to connect! The author also does a great job of chronicling the decades of work it took (and still is taking) to identify, understand and advocate for individuals with autism. Honestly, I feel like if you know anyone with autism, you kinda just need to read the book."
43,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48540215-missy-attridge,4,"I have always been curious about Autism/Aspergers and when my college classmate wrote this book I decided to check it out. It was beautifully written, heartfelt, non-judgmental, and I learned a lot. While it is filled with facts and the history of the condition and medical awareness of it, it is the story telling that makes it compelling. You get to know many families trying to cope with and help their children live successfully with autism. The only reason I did not give it five stars was that a few sections went into more detail than I needed, so I skimmed them (though I did not want to skip over them entirely). It will stick with me for a long time. . ."

The authors did an outstanding job of breaking down the history of autism into gripping segments with real narratives to follow. It certainly does not read like a traditional history book.Absolutely recommend to anyone diagnosed with, family of, or working with people diagnosed with ASD."
45,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66562677-adriana,4,"Heartbreakingly informative book about the history of autism. There were so many new things I learned from this book. I cannot imagine having kids with autism in the past. So often I feel judged, feel like there isn’t enough services or information, but it is nothing compared to what mothers in the past had to deal with, and what these kids had to go through, just broke my heart. We’ve come a long way from what we thought autism was, or the way it was treated. "
46,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8767705-pam,5,"this was a heartbreaking but important read. No detail left out. I challenge anyone who cares for, works with or loves someone with autism to read this book"

48,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13412666-wendy-cushing,5,Incredible story of the history of autism as we know it.
49,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2978680-tricia,5,"One of the most comprehensive books on Autism I've ever picked up and I'm so glad I read it. I wish everyone would read it although I know that a book this dense is a tough sell for anyone without a direct investment in an Autistic person. I appreciate, more than anything, that this book helped me learn about my community; it's history, strivings, failings, growth and current trajectory. As hard as the last few years of my life have been, reading about those who have come before me was empowering and made me so grateful. I have never felt more of a genuine sisterhood than reading the stories of previous mothers, some who fiercely fought for services and policies that my son and I directly benefit from today. And that is just amazing."
50,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21993174-laura-stone,3,Very informative and easy to read with personal stories. The size of the book was intimidating but turned out to quite interesting 
51,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6348232-jason,4,"A very well done book regarding the history of autism, one that answered a couple of very large questions for me. Well-researched and thorough, and unsurprisingly painful in a lot of places. "
52,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6082038-adam,4,"Voluminous history of the illness which was first called ""autism"" in 1943. I found it a very interesting mix of medical and social history until about 2/3 of the way in, when long descriptions of the emergence of Autism Speaks and battles between anti-vaxers and the scientific community started to drag a bit. I would have liked more description of the scientific and medical work being done on the condition, and less about in-fighting between activists. Still, I learned a lot, and it's a monumental work."
53,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6015121-debbie,4,"Don't let the length of the book scare you off. I found the subject fascinating and you will too. The book is very readable and even though the subject is heavy some of the story will absolutely uplift you. You will definitely cry when you read the history of people with early diagnoses of autism. Like others with mental challenges autistics were typically placed in institutions where they were warehoused. The story of Archie Casto in particular will absolutely break your heart. Likewise the story of Donald Triplett will bring a tear but also make you smile.I think the authors did an incredible job of presenting the history in a ""non-judgmental/tell both sides of the story"" way. Everyone was given the benefit of the doubt and presented as someone who was working for the best interests of children, rather than assuming the worst. Unfortunately, sometimes there was no way to continue to portray some individuals in a good light (Dr Asperger, Dr Wakefield) but even then I think the authors did a good job of staying objective.I would recommend this book to everyone. I think when you hear autism you think of Temple Grandin or some of the higher functioning people with autism that we have gone to school with or worked with. I think the more challenged individuals are not seen and not considered by most people and that's a shame. Many families are suffering financially, physically, emotionally, and every other way with a severely disabled individual who will never learn to speak, never be comfortable with touch, never sleep through the night, never be free of gastro disorders, etc. and most of us are just unaware of the terrible situation they are in.The only criticism I have of the book is I didn't get a sense of where we are at all in the research. Even though vaccines (mercury, thimerasol) have been completely debunked as the cause it doesn't seem there is any idea of the cause and there was no presentation of treatments (other than early behavioral interventions). The book gave the impression that research has been well funded for the last 15 or so years but did not give an impression of what the research has accomplished. "
54,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915017-anna,3,"This is a long book; 23h if read as regular speed. the readerʻs voice is good: i could speed it up ton3x without it being choppy.it covers a lot about the history of how autistic people have been treated.locked up, drugged up to the eyeballs without consent, forced to godawful ABA behavior modification training - all so that we could pass as neurotypical people. reading about all that history and the way autistic people are still seen makes me extremely angry.if you see me somehwere ""in the real life"", i wonʻt do eye contact. i wonʻt say hi, and will do a silent social smile when interacting with people. iʻve been always recommended to stay closetautistic, to stfu and just try to ""pass"" like a NT.thereʻs a cost to that.but as i have no facial recognition, canʻt see/interpret facisl expressions even on cinema, struggle with things that need seeing, what do i have to lose? i tell new people to tell me hi if they see me somewhere, but that i wonʻt recognize them... i can show or tell how to do something without relying on what you can see. like how i use my phone when i donʻt see the screen or read books with the same basic problem. yet, people knowing about my struggles with print and technology have loudly complained, behind my back no less, about my inability to get their nonverbals. ffs people - i donʻt see you, and i canʻt hear between your spoken words in that cutesy social worker sounding voice. talk direct and straight, use clear words. iʻm tired of hiding, so what it means is since being ""out of the closet"" is iʻve learned to be careful about who i say anything to. i let the sighted neurotypicals live in their own world around me, while i live in mine, ""hiding in plain sight"".there is no perspective from any actually autidtic person in this book.no one tells the neurotypicals how we see or perceive the world.and that is a big minus for a book of this size.try Steve Silbermanʻs Neurotribes instead, or something by Temple Grandin."
55,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253719-vickie,5,"A book that I requested due to the subject matter, but wasn't sure how to approach reading it. I don't typically read much non-fiction except the occasional biography or autobiography. Would I skim this due its daunting size, a TPB of 654 pages] to get a review out quickly and come back to it later and do a more thorough review? Or read it all the way through, however long it took, to get every bit of information from its pages?I read it all the way through, daunting size and non-fiction notwithstanding. It is an AMAZING story/history and so wonderfully written. It flows smoothly, exceptionally well-organized to keep the story moving and to articulate the incredible evidence for the lay-person. From the first documented case of autism, to the search for those in the past who might have been autistic but misdiagnosed, the origin of the term autism, to how mothers of autistic children were treated like it was their fault the autism occurred. The men and women who wanted to decipher autism and show that education was possible as much for the children as it was for the family and friends who loved them. There were self-made 'experts' who did more harm than good, there were the pioneers who discovered treatments and that there are degrees of autism, not just all-encompassing but gradations and levels and capacities. That the introduction of the term 'Asperger Syndrome' was an accident, but almost immediately caught on. And how Hollywood portrayed autism, both wonderfully and not as well as could be. There were many misdiagnosis, misconceptions, the embracing and the pushing away. This is just a wonderful book, not just about autism itself, but the people within its sphere. The stories they want to tell and have the world understand.A very definite recommend."
56,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10604067-bonnye-reed,5,"GAB I received a free copy of this very interesting read from Goodreads, authors John Donvan and Caren Zucker, and Penguin RandomHouse, Crown Publishing Group in exchange for an honest review. Thank you all, for sharing your work with me.I found the sheer size of this history of autism daunting - but was a hundred and twenty pages in before I refilled my coffee cup. Written in a clear, easy-going style and with heart, before you know it your are caught up in the struggle for recognition and understanding of this fast growing, diverse spectrum of individual patterning we now know as autism. Though there are many historical instances of spectrum-like behavior as far back as written history goes, the first actual diagnosis of ""autistic disturbances of affective contact"" was made by Dr. Leo Kanner in September of 1942. Institutionalization was the only recommended procedure that followed that diagnosis. It was not until 1966 that the medical community actually admitted that autism in children was NOT caused by their 'refrigerator' mother's coldness and neglect. The general public still at times finds fault with the parenting of these children as a cause of autism. Some physicians, journalists, educators, lawyers and politicians eventually fell in step to support the strong, committed parents who struggled so long to receive equality in education and medical support for their children, but it was the 1990's before much was accomplished to insure help for these families, and clear uncaring Moms and vaccinations of children against viral illnesses - measles, polio, smallpox, rubella, mumps, etc - as an autism cause. This is an excellent history of autism, and a must read for educators, medical personnel, and family and friends of the autistic.  "
57,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2326664-alexis,4,"It's not entirely fair that I review this book without having reviewed NeuroTribes, a book with which it will inevitably be compared. I will have to leave it with saying that I greatly enjoyed NeuroTribes and it was one of my top books of 2015.While In a Different Key has enjoyed positive reviews from the mainstream press, it's been received less enthusiastically by neurodiversity advocates, with one going so far as to title her review ""I read [it] so you don't have to."" I think that goes too far. While there is troubling language in this book (for example, readers are invited to sympathize with a father who killed his autistic son), the book adds to the history of autism. It does primarily focus on the families and researchers, and less (until the end of the book, and the initial chapters on Donald Triplett) the voices of those who are themselves autistic. As a definitive history, this is a flaw, but a great deal of the history is still enlightening and interesting. The approach is more of a survey than NeuroTribes, which focused more intensely on fewer topics. Some of the sins of tone are borne of a desire for ""balance"" and sympathy, even when this is not necessarily appropriate to the topic. I would recommend tht people interested in the history of autism read both these books. NeuroTribes is more compelling as a story of autism, but In a Different Key fills in many gaps in people and chronology. The books also offer distinctly different characterizations of Hans Asperger, and readers may wish to decide for themselves."
58,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/992516-jill,4,"I had the opportunity to read an Advanced Readers Copy of this book and absolutely loved it. It is a big book and could appear daunting given the topic and science involved, but the authors treat the subject matter like a narrative non-fiction, giving way to a compelling and easy read, despite the length of the book. The timeline at the very back of the book was helpful as the book isn't structured in a strict chronological order, but that was clearly done as a means of helping the narrative flow. I'd highly recommend this for anyone with even an inkling of interest in learning more about autism, although parents of children who are autistic might find some of the earlier ""treatments"" difficult to read about. The later chapters dealing with the anti-vaccine movement were handled in a sensitive manner that still managed to respect the beliefs of the anti-vaxxers. My only criticism is that often the writers employed a variation on the deus ex machina technique. What I mean is, it would be at a point in the story when some Big Thing in the history of autism was about to happen and suddenly the last line of a section would be akin to ""And then So-and-So entered the picture and everything changed."" It happened frequently and while I can appreciate there are only so many available methods for introducing new ""characters"" like that, I found it a bit tedious after awhile."
59,0307985679,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30662508-melissa,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This book was unlike any other book I have read on the topic of autism. When I first got this book and saw how long it was, I was a but nervous that it would be a very technical dense read, but it was completely readable. As someone living life on the spectrum I learned new information. Many books I read are just a rehash of what I already know. But this was a complete historical account on Autism up the the present day. For example I was never aware that LSD was tested on children, and only vaguely understood the vaccination debate, as well as now understanding where the naming of Asperger's came from. These were some of the many new topics for me. Even if you are familiar with Autism, I think everyone could learn something from this book. In particular what I thought set this book apart from many others written on the topic were the accounts written by parents of their children growing up with disorders, whether they were in institutions or not. The personal stories were wonderful to have been included and shared. I feel that for me this added a lot. Had these not been included, while extremely detailed the book would not have been the same for me. In most other cases books are solely based on the authors experiences. It was lovely being able to follow the journey of Donald Triplett introduced at the beginning of the book as well as others."
