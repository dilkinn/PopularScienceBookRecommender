0,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3720171-scottekim,5,"A series of very good essays, aimed at bringing math alive to a general audience, originally given as public lectures in an annual series that is 168 years old, starting with Michael Faraday. By Ian Stewart, one of the best popular math writers of our day. What I especially like is this comment on the nature of mathematics in the introduction:What is a businessman? Someone who does business? Yes, but not just that. A businessman is someone who sees an opportunity for doing business where the rest of us see nothing: while we're complaining that there's no restaurant in the area, he's organising a telephone pizza delivery service. A mathematician is someone who sees opportunities for doing mathematics that the rest of us miss."

I'm interested on read more of his works. I wanted to buy "" letter to a young mathematician"" but I found this and I hope I can find it.I'm looking for more books about mathematics and science. I hope to give more of them.I wish they could bring here at Mexico in English, but well not matter to me, at least, I read Spanish and English. :)"
2,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2983742-daniel,3,"I enjoy reading about math though I don't always understand what I am reading. My favorite parts of the book were the parts about Fibonacci numbers, the length of shoe lacing, fractals. I wish I could write better book reviews. I do know one thing I want to know more about math. "

5,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2982901-stephen-clynes,2,"This book was written in 1997 and I downloaded a free copy onto my Kindle although it is no longer available on Amazon for some reason. The book uses the metaphor of a maze to explore how our world is related to mathematics. It is not a text book on pure mathematics but an easy read on applied mathematics - how our world follows mathematical rules. It does explain the beauty of mathematics and is very easy to understand. The aim of this book is clear.Ian leads the reader through a number of problems that make you think. Ian does show the beauty of mathematics in everyday life but he does go into extreme detail and history. Ian does not give any conscise answers and fills his book with tons of background from mathematicians who are long gone and dead. Ian is an expert in his field and can get his message across but it is a long journey.93% of this Kindle eBook is the content of his work but the last 7% is references he has referred to earlier. The average reader will not need to know his sources so that they can check them, you can take them in good faith. I feel that this book has not covered an awful lot of ground but the small ground it has covered has been drilled to death. The reading pleasure I got from this book was poor as the number of mathematical issues covered was small. I did not like the employment of the maze metaphor as the detailed description of hedges, walls etc had little to do with mathematics and just padded the book out wasting the readers time.I really enjoy applied mathematics but this book was a disappointment. It was not a good daily read and although Ian maybe a good teacher of mathematics, he is not a good author. I did not like the way this book was written. I did not like it's structure, the way Ian waffled on about mathematicians who were dead and gone. I really hated his stupid idea of a maze that the reader had to travel through. It was not an entertaining read and therefore failed as a book."
6,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1118264-william,4,"An interesting overview of several topics in Mathematics. Much I have read about elsewhere (Fibonacci series, for example) but the sections on Fractals and on the Turning model railroad were fascinating, even if I had a hard time conceptualizing them. An interactive digital edition of the text would likely be perfect for communicating these subjects to the audience.My only criticism of the subject material is where the author condemns the ""Market Economy"" because it cannot possibly have enough timely and accurate information to make the most efficient decisions. Is there even a single government economy that can do any better? I highly doubt it. Regardless, he should leave controversial economic matters to experts in that field.One other complaint is that the method of ""pointers"" to items in the appendix (without any reference numbers) made it difficult to match the note I was trying to find. I would encourage returning to the usual footnote conventions in the next edition of the book."
7,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175962-rosalind,4,"I read this in between other things, in a Kindle edition that came free from Amazon.This is something unusual: a book about mathematics which is aimed at a general audience but doesn't restrict itself to trivia. So it's a satisfying read for somebody like me, a non-mathematician who nevertheless has had more than a basic exposure to the subject and who continues to take an interest in it at more than a superficial level. That's a gap that there's all too little on the shelves to fill. Though there are few heavy formulae here, Professor Stewart probes more deeply into his material than most.It follows that those without a mathematical background looking for an overview might find it heavy going. Not that I'd want to put anybody off who wants to make the effort – it's well worth while."
8,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18101897-omarove,5,"What a fantastic book. The idea of materializing Mathematics into a maze was amazingly done. The author made the reader to seek the ignored beauty of Mathematics and its silent role in the Nature. The more I read similar books the more I find myself ignorant to the true meaning of Mathematics. I could imagine myself obtaining a degree in Mathematics one day ... I would really like to re-enter the maze and get stuck for more time in its junctions, especially in the one discussing Turing Machines. One of the most fascinating topics discussed in this book was the fractals. It was the first time for me to know about Sierpinski Gasket and would like to investigate more about it.Recommended to anyone seeking to grasp the secrets of the world s/he's living in. At least a glimpse to those secrets ..."
9,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/194779-ginnz,3,"So I had high hopes for this book. I'd read ""does God pay dice"" and ""from here to infinity"" in the past and enjoyed the way Ian Steward presented mathematics as something accessible.The first half of the book lived up to expectations. I did find the constant reference to the maze a little tedious(but it's the title of the book so can hardly grip to much.) Unfortunately by the time we got to Turing machines I was a little over the book and had started to read the far more enjoyable ""how long is a piece of string""It's a shame much of the book was fascinating. Fibonacci's numbers, calendars and their quirks was all explained naturally in the ""just in time"" model I wish we could use in schools.So while the book was good I was let down."
10,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8107144-sytse,3,"This book is quite interesting, it covers a lot of subjects. I find his way of writing a bit annoying though. Stewart does a great job at introducing the problems, but his explanation doesn't seem all to clear and easy enough to follow for non-mathematicians. It could just be the Dutch translation that I've read, but I would not recommend this book to people who don't know a little math already. Nothing special really, just another ""make math popular book""."
11,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9236862-david,4,I picked this book up again after losing my way with it some time ago. I was reading a physical fiction book which was a Christmas present and wanted something electronic for those moments when you need it. I'm glad I persevered; there were very good sections on the Monty Hall problem and on chaos theory. A bit more of your actual maths in this one than in some of the other books I've read.
12,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18877475-rory-armstrong,3,"A collection of essays on different aspects of Math. Ranges from geometry, sets, logic, and chaos theory. It's all very low level stuff, but sometimes the descriptions are not a fluid as they have been. An interesting book nontheless and worth the high price of Free, but I'm not sure if I would pay for it!"
13,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4223286-ken,2,"There are some interesting nuggets on mathematics in this book but it's not as easy as it's made out to be in the blurb. This is more for people who are already interested in maths and want to find out more how it relates to the world. If you enjoy maths, this is a good book. If not then I don't think this book will change anything for you."
14,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6556416-jamie,5,"The Magical Maze is an excellent book covering many areas of mathematics, including some less obvious like the symmetry of slime molds. It uses the metaphor of a maze to tell a story, with an Entrance instead of an introduction, Passages instead of chapters, and instead of an afterword there is an Exit. It is very well-written and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in math."
15,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4401053-phil-scovis,4,"Mathematics is so widely thought to be a boring, tedious, dry, and useless activity. Building computers out of train sets? Solving optimization problems with soap bubbles and slime molds? Very much in the style of the late Martin Gardner, this book shows us the fascinating and exciting face of mathematics."
16,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5379964-alberto-garcia-ariza,3,"Pensé que iba a ser más de divulgación, pero en realidad es un libro sobre matemáticas. No es que sean complicadas, pero tampoco son fáciles, y no es para leerlo en cualquier momento. Hay que ponerse. No obstante, es recomendable"
17,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366630-eal,3,"Interesting topics, subpar writing. Brings up some good non-math points about the need to make knowledge accessible and to expose yourself to varied influences. Will read more stuff by this author as long as the focus remains on math concepts."
18,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4854532-jack,3,"An interesting look at a fascinating subject. Though I struggle with the more complex aspects of mathematics, this book makes it seem worth persevering."
19,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1862015-hollis,4,Interesting but I find that his analogies and stories become so elaborate at times that they are harder to follow than the actual mathematics that he is describing!
20,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096283-rachel-x1f49a,3,quite difficult to keep up with... probably not a very good night time read
21,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3150664-carmen-mandel,5,Ian Stweart is as compelling as always
22,0753805146,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1308512-lindsay,3,A very well presented book looking at different areas of mathematics. I found it really interesting how many of the topics were related to how the mathematical patterns were used in nature.
