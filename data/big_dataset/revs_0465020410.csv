0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444658-charlie,1,I did not enjoy this book. The main premise was that cooking makes food easier to consume as well as easier to digest. This advancement allowed humans to consume more energy to support a bigger brain.Now you do not have to read this book.
1,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373579-summer-bock-holistic-nutrition-herbs,4,"From the first page I liked the writing style. I found it easy to follow and understand, although a good knowledge of either nutrition or anthropology will make it a faster and more comprehensible read. According to Wrangham, there are no raw food cultures ever recorded in human history. Yes, people eat foods raw but no culture has ever done this exclusively. Using this and other points, he provides an interesting critique to the raw movement. Throughout the book Wrangham impressed me with the quality of the studies he selected to back up his theorizing. His theories were well supported and well argued. He first shows that the evolution of humans was directly linked first to the use of fire and second to using fire to cook food. Perhaps because he is a primatologist, he draws frequent parallels between humans and animals throughout the book. He uses the comparisons as a way to understanding how we as humans ended up in the unique position of being the only animal that cooks and how this has affected and changed us. In particular, he argues that the process of cooking created a fascinating shift in our anatomy that led to bigger brains and smaller digestive systems. Wrangham also offers an interesting critique of our current method of caloric analysis of foods. In his writing he discusses the actual differences in nutritional values in cooked versus raw food. He also takes into account the amount of work our bodies have to do in order to digest various macromolecules such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Fat is the easiest to digest. Protein takes more work to digest if eaten with high fiber foods. Softer food makes you gain weight easier. Harder food takes more work and you will not gain weight as easily. He cites an interesting study in which rats were given the same amount of calories per day. One group of rats had their food pellets ‘puffed’ to soften them, while the other group just ate regular pellets. At the end of the study, the rats that ate the softer pellets weighed more than the rats that ate the harder pellets. The rats that ate hard pellets literally had to burn more calories in order to digest the harder food. Because the puffed pellets were softer, the nutrition and energy from them was incorporated and digested with ease.He had a few random judgments that stood out to me as unnecessary and unprofessional. His comment “Life can be unfair” in regards to how two people can eat the same amount of calories and if your digestive tract works harder (as is the case with most lean people) then you will gain less weight. And vice versa. This flippant and unpleasant side note should have been left out. He also made the statement that you rarely find amenorrhea in women who eat primarily cooked food. Amenorrhea is a pathology where a women stops having her period, which is linked to osteoporosis. He says that it is common among women on a predominantly raw-food diet. I believe these statements to be completely unfounded. I have worked with a number of women with amenorrhea and they are not raw-foodists. I have a hard time believing I have found the very rare ones. From everything I have read, it is not a rare condition in women. All in all, I really thought this was a great read. It got me thinking and his anthropological prospective was a welcome shift from the nutrition centric books I’m usually pouring over. I enjoyed the historical and evolutionary approach to understanding our relationship to food. I also enjoyed learning about the evolution of human anatomy in direct correlation with the foods we eat.I’d like to take a moment to expound upon my own theories on the subject of cooking and raw food inspired by the topics of this book. Keep reading if you are interested in hearing how some of my thoughts shifted from Wrangham’s work....I think all health counselors should read this book to gain a more well-rounded perspective on the history of cooked food and how cooking effects the nutritional value of food. I appreciate the shift in my viewpoint. It filled in a lot of blanks for me with regard to the raw food movement. I love eating raw, but have never quite gotten into it as a full-time dietary change other than a few month-long cleanses. Currently, I eat at least 75% of my food raw and this is fabulous for me. And I also notice that I enjoy the option of eating warm foods regularly. I like how grounded I feel after soup or grains. What if the raw food movement is another dietary fad that is the answer to the high consumption of refined, chemicalized, pesticide-ridden, homogenized, and heavily processed foods. The Standard American Diet laden with meat and animal products left the United States feeling clogged and sluggish. Our country is host to millions of people who have a lot of gunk to cleanse from their intestines and the raw food diet offers this in a great way that doesn’t require you totally fast from food. You are cleansing and eating at the same time, which allows you to cleanse while working or doing your other day to day tasks. I think it is important to eat raw foods, but I also think it is important to stay balanced and build digestive fire. Sometimes a continual diet of raw foods can dampen digestive fire. If you already experience compromised digestive function eating 100% raw foods may be very difficult because it can further impair digestion. When I read raw food books, I seldom see this important issue being addressed. I also get concerned for my clients who experience alienation from their families from eating a healing diet while overcoming health concerns. People connect and come together around food. This builds community and defines culture. For this reason it is important to find common ground within your family and eat food together. This strengthens family and community and creates a place to connect. This has been happening for thousands upon thousands of years. The nurturing of family and community is very important in holistic health. It strengthens our relationships, which are one of the main facets of primary food. "

Basically, the amount of energy required to digest the fruits and vegetables isn't enough to keep someone alive for a long period of time. This was very good to know, as I'd been thinking of going raw when we got back home (merely to see what it was like). Now, of course, knowing what I do, I'll be staying well away from that— I'm thin enough as it is.In case you don't have time to read the whole book:- Cooking gelatinizes starch, denatures proteins, melts fat, and makes meat easier to chew, all contributing to the extraordinarily short amount of time humans spend chewing and digesting.- This shorter digestion time shortened the gut, allowing more energy to be directed to brain size and growth.- Cooking wouldn't have evolved to the extent it has now if men and women hadn't formed a partnership. Women provide the staples in most cultures, as well as the cooking, while men spend hours away hunting. They come home to a cooked meal, sometimes bringing meat and/or honey. The trade-off for women is that men who aren't their close kin or husbands don't dare steal their food.A few more interesting notes:- A wife is more important for her hearth-side care than sex favors in hunter-gatherer societies. A woman could give out sexual favors to practically anyone… but feeding anyone other than her husband? Absolutely not.- Inuits, who send their men out to hunt for all food, still need women. To cook and make clothes, without which men wouldn't be able to hunt.- The advent of cooking also brought about the sexual inequality that is pervasive in most not-completely-modern cultures nowadays. - People in rich Western cultures now have to find a way to make eating their cooked food healthier.So, in sum, it's a fascinating book which explained to me what damper is (ground grass seed flour made into bread), different cultures, different methods of food preparation, all of which are very helpful for writing. It definitely offers a different way of looking at evolution… and like most theories… it makes sense."

It was well-read though, and I would recommend it, so that's a plus."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845609-kate,3,"How did australopithecines develop into Homo erectus? The traditional answer has been that the use of tools allowed them to hunt, and that the increased protein in the diet allowed the developmental spurt toward a bigger brain. But there are two, not one, major jumps in development along this road toward Homo sapiens. Richard Wrangham argues that the first, as has been established, resulted from hunting and eating more meat (and not just consuming scavenged meat), but that the second came from cooking food, which implies controlling fire. I almost put the book down after the first chapter, “The Quest for Raw Foodists.” The author denigrates vegetarians and raw foodists in such a way that I wondered whether he had had a relationship with a salad lover that had gone south, which might account for his contemptuous tone. That aside, he uses anecdotal and indirect evidence to suggest that cooked food allowed homo erectus to evolve, and that the species can not longer thrive on a raw food diet for any extended length of time.Fascinating was the report of the Evo Diet, an experiment conducted in 2006 in the UK with patients suffering from life-threateningly high blood pressure. They submitted to a raw food diet for 2 weeks, consisting of 50 kinds of raw fruits, veg and nuts in huge quantities (except for one man, who snuck chocolate in week 2). The all brought their blood pressure down to less dangerous levels, but the diet had an unintended side effect: they all lost weight, about a pound each day. The rest of the book argues that cooked food releases more energy (calories) than the same food would release if it were raw. This is true for both meat and plant-based foods. And the implications of this fact/argument are surprising.1. Cooking softens food, and soft food is more easily digested and requires less energy to utilize than hard food. Among rats that were given hard pellets and the same pellets “puffed” like children’s cereal, the soft-food rats became obese in a matter of months, even through they were consuming the same number of calories as the hard pellet rats.2. Soft food allowed homo erectus to develop smaller digestive organs. Because of the “conservation of total bodily organ mass,” this allowed h.e. to develop much larger brains. 3. In all hunter-gatherer societies, women gather and men hunt. Cooking food further differentiated the gendered division of labor, so that women also became the keepers of the fire and the cooks. This also made women vulnerable, since smoke from a cooking fire can be seen from a mile away. Women received protection and occasional meat from men, and men received a cooked meal from women, and voila, marriage was born. My question though: if men are off hunting, how can they be protecting the hearth at the same time?4. This model challenges the convention, as anthropologists usually see marriage as “an exchange in which women get resources and men get a guarantee of paternity.” In this model, however, men marry so that they are guaranteed a hot meal. I’m not a specialist in this field and would have to do much more reading to evaluate this properly, but I wonder just how many of the ideas presented in this book are Richard Wrangham’s. Ailello and Wheeler had (by Wrangham’s own description) attributted the increase in brain size to the invention of cooking. Furthermore, we’ve known for a long time that large-grain whole wheat bread is less fattening than highly milled white bread (because the whole grain bread costs us more energy to digest, and we eliminate many indigestible particles), and that cooked carrots have a much higher glycemic index than raw carrots (which is why some people choose a raw food diet to lost weight). Richard Wrangham’s greatest contribution might be telling these facts in a series of anecdotes. You’ll have to read about the snake experiments yourself, but I’ll tell you about the Inuit diet. It won’t be too much of a spoiler. The sub-arctic Puiplirmiuts eat frozen caribou dropping like berries (thus raw), whereas most other neighboring tribes find this a waste of good food and take the partially digested lichen pellets (=euphemism) and boil them in blood soup. Maybe the most valuable contribution of this book is that it explains why there are no Inuit restaurants in London. "
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11881042-amy-raby,5,"This is a fascinating book! Just so you know, it is NOT the Hunger Games sequel! This is an anthropology/evolutionary biology book that posits the theory that what made us human--that is, what allowed us to develop bigger brains and many of the unique aspects of human culture--was not hunting, but the use of fire to cook our food. And that the acquisition of fire happened much earlier than is generally assumed, at the time of homo erectus, not homo sapiens.There is a really interesting discussion in this book about raw foods and whether humans can survive on them (answer: under normal conditions, no). Every other animal can thrive on raw food, but when humans are restricted to a raw food diet, we lose weight. This also means that our estimates for counting calories are wrong because an apple is considered to be about 120 calories whether cooked or raw, but our digestive system extracts more calories from cooked food than from raw food. We also extract more calories from foods that are highly processed (e.g., ground up). But I've never seen any calorie counter that accounted for these differences.The second half of the book goes into some of the ways that cooking shaped human society in ways that benefited men more than women. In short, the roots of pair bonding and of patriarchy, particularly male exploitation of female labor, go back earlier than homo sapiens, all the way back to homo erectus. This is a rather disturbing chapter of the book. But it explains a great deal."

Bipedality, language, cooperation, tool use, cooking of food, and many other factors went in to making us the species we are today.How the cooking of food shaped our evolution is an interesting topic but I did not find this a particularly interesting book. Wrangham starts out by spending an inordinate amount of time bashing people who eat raw food diets. It went way beyond presenting evidence that eating an exclusively raw diet is not healthy for humans into bringing up ridiculous crackpot ideas that individuals have had about the benefits of raw food. Every idea he discusses is beat to death as he tries to stretch out his thesis into book length. He barely manages that as the book contains just over 200 pages of text with another 100 as notes. This could have been an excellent long article in a magazine but as a book, it's a fail. The most interesting part for me came at the very end as he discusses flaws in the way we calculate nutritional content information. Sadly, it was too little, too late."

It’s a convincing idea: what caused humans to be able to evolve such big brains and short digestive tracts, compared to other species? The answer, according to Wrangham: first the ability to hunt and eat raw meat, then control of fire for cooking meat.It’s a very readable book, making all the science and history easy to follow. For me, it was an enjoyable read, though not exactly revolutionary; I was aware of most of the ideas already, since I’m fascinated by human evolution. It pulls together various different threads of the story, bringing together evidence from different ways of understanding human evolution.(Oh, but if you don’t believe in evolution, this… will not be the book for you. That’s definitely an assumption of the book.)Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."

Cross species comparisons make a lot of sense as Wrangham develops his argument.Essential read, especially when he addresses gender issues. He sidesteps the challenge of the origins of language but nonetheless locates humans in the context of changing and challenging environments. "
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"Wrangham's thesis is that fire is what made modern humans. We didn't just learn to use fire because we were so smart: using fire actually gave us an evolutionary advantage which led to our being smart. In a nutshell: cooked food is more nutritious and easier to eat, thus allowing our evolutionary ancestors to acquire more calories for less effort, increasing their survival and also freeing up more time for things like inventing the wheel.At first this may seem counter-intuitive, but Wrangham makes a convincing case, talking about the speed of evolution and how it's plausible that humans could indeed have evolved as a result of our control of fire, which Wrangham dates back to (possibly) up to a quarter of a million years ago. He talks about the physiology of chewing and digestion, how our australopithicene ancestors differed from us in how they ate, and crucial differences between human diets and monkey diets. Lots of talk about how the body handles cooked meat and vegetables differently than raw meat and vegetables. All of this is fascinating and convincing.I think the second part of the book is weaker, as Wrangham goes into evolutionary psychology, which as usual involves a lot of speculation but without much evidence. Many of the later chapters felt a bit padded, like he had an obligation to bring in a social and cultural dimension to the argument. This I found less convincing -- we get a lot of talk about how cooking and food preparation shakes out in ""primitive"" societies, but this is all dealing with homo sapiens in our modern state. It's somewhat interesting but I don't think it really contributes much to his central thesis, which is supported strongly enough by the physical evidence.Overall, a good food science and physical anthropology book.Recommended for: Fans of evolution, monkeys, and cooked food.Not recommended for: Creationists, vegans, or raw foodists."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34702091-jane-louis-wood,4,"This author makes a convincing case for consumption of cooked food and nocturnal fires being the spur to humans developing the physiological characteristics that made them properly human: slow to mature, large of brain and free of fur (n.b. hipsters are not properly human). Wrangham refutes other hypotheses effectively and goes into riveting detail about the consequences of cooking on the evolution of the human body.His theories about how food affected social behaviour, however, are largely supposition and much less convincing. He paints a lovely picture of humans sitting around the camp fire learning to make social chitchat and not annoy one another, skills that weren't needed when they were busy gnawing uncooked roots and grinding their teeth to dust chewing raw bison straight off the carcass. he suggests that older early women cooked up extra food for sisters who were busy nursing. I'm not convinced, given that for most of recorded human society the ones doing the cooking have always been subordinate to the ones doing moist of the eating. The notes are very detailed and comprise almost a quarter of the book which made the end feel oddly abrupt. "
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,4,"""Cathing fire"" is an interesting book. It presents some ideas that are original and thought-provoking about the phenomena that made us human. Some of them are perhaps too far-stretched and the author is too busy focusing on his main subject - processing the food - to notice the conglomerate of many other influences, not rooted in the food (pre)history. In short, the book offers interesting contents, but it is too biased.It is also too repetitive - the same arguments appear dozens of times on its pages. There was a point when I felt almost bored and wanted to put the book aside - but then interesting things appeared, and hardly it became entertaining again, when it ended unexpectedly (I was reading it on Kindle, so that I didin't notice at the beginning that at 60% the book is finished and the rest is just endnotes - which, by the way, do not provide any particular additional entertainment or in-depth knowledge).Overall - not a bad read, quite interesting, but definitely doesn't meet expectations."
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10821965-ubiquitousbastard,4,"This basically offered everything I wanted out of it. The book explored how fire affected human development, but went beyond humans, stating it likely that Erectus and maybe even Habilis began our love affair with cooked food. Wrangham didn't just conjecture, but used similar species as well as primitive societies still in existence in order to demonstrate natural inclinations. Sure, it went sort of gender history toward the end, but Wrangham's reasoning did seem rather believable, if slightly off topic in the way that we are human. I don't necessarily think that gender roles are key to what makes us human, but that's just my own view."

Cooked food vs raw food has had a tremendous impact and this book covers very many of the results without being boring. 
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,3,"Wrangham presents and defends well the hypothesis that cooking had major evolutionary consequences for the development of anatomically modern humans, including diminishment in size of mandibles, dentition, and intestines. He presents good arguments for the early control of fire and for its use in cooking by at least one group of habilines who then evolved into Homo erectus. His arguments for the evolutionary advantages provided by cooked food (less time spent in chewing, more calories available per unit of food consumed, less energy expended in digestion, more energy available to power larger brains, etc.) are convincing. When he moves into the social development of early humans and the effects of cooking thereon, however, he tends to attribute too much to cooking alone. While the hearth did provide a focus for the ""household,"" there were many factors involved in the creation of the nuclear family and in determining gender roles. There does seem to be a tendency on the part of some scholars to attribute more to single important factors they have identified than the evidence will support. This is a particular danger in explaining social developments, which often result from complex contributing factors for which physical evidence is either lacking or ambiguous. Although the author issues the customary caveats about contemproary hunter/gatherer societies being ""modern"" rather than ""primitive,"" he puts a lot of weight on reasoning backward from observations of the current practices of such groups to the hypothetical social behaviors of early humans. A monograph on his principal hypothesis might have been less sexy than this book, but it would have been more focussed and less speculative. The book has detailed notes and a good bibliography. "
16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041498-leanne,4,"Before reading this book, I was leery of the raw food movement, but now I know why. Wrangham exposes the pseudoscientific justifications for the movement, some of which are unbelievably ridiculous (such as that the cessation of a woman's menstrual period is a good thing because it means that the raw foodist no longer has any toxins to clear out of the body). Apparently, a strict raw-food diet would not give a person enough energy to meet his/ her needs. I don't have to feel any guilt for my mostly-cooked vegan diet!Wrangham explains why all human cultures have relegated cooking to the female sex without justifying it. He seems to be saying that although many features of human society are inherited from our distant human and prehuman past, we should not feel bound to perpetuate harmful practices, such as the patriarchal assignment of gender roles or the eating of too much cooked, highly processed foods. We need to cook most foods in order to make the nutrients available to us to fuel our large human brains, but we should incorporate some raw foods into our diet. We should avoid a lot of refined, fibre-poor foods (which our evolutionary history has caused us to crave), since we tend to grow fat on a diet in which glucose is too readily available to us."

This book presents an interesting theory that a breakthrough moment in human evolution was when man began cooking his food. Cooking the food allowed more calories to be absorbed, changing the shape of primates from having large digestive tracts to large brains. Although the book is very technical, it is presented in a way such that people without a background in biology or anthropology can easily understand. I especially enjoyed the chapters on how social roles developed - males hunting and females cooking. Very informative!"

20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7895515-felipe,4,"This book offers a compelling case for the idea that cooking is the main reason why we evolved from australopithecines to Homo erectus and then to Homo sapiens. It challenges at several points the mainstream notion that meat-eating was a keystone of (at least some parts of) this evolution, for having comparatively limited explanatory power. Besides the anatomical changes it uses cooking to explain some things I wouldn't have expected, such as marriage and the sexual division of labor.I thought the point was generally well-argued and at the same time the book provided enough interesting bits to keep a wide audience interested. There are plenty of anecdotes (favorite example: the author adds tough leaves to a raw goat meat meal to test that they make chewing easier), and many references to actual studies in the endnotes for the true nerds.It has a problem that might be unavoidable in this kind of pop-sci book: there's always a lot of uncertainty in modern science (especially in something with as little archeological evidence as fire), but, because the author wants to make their case as persuasive as possible, diverging points tend to be omitted or minimized. As a result, it's sometimes hard to know what's well established and what's controversial. For example, a core point in the book (why is the human brain so unusually large?) relies on the expensive tissue hypothesis. The author does note that it's a hypothesis, but there's no exploration of why it's still one, or how accepted it is in the field."

26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/767898-emily,4,"Dr. Wrangham is a British Primatologist over at Harvard and his book, “Catching Fire,” is an interesting science book full of nothing but science. He starts with a basic supposition that something happened on the evolutionary boundary between the habilines, largely shown as Homo Habilis and our buddy Home Erectus. By examining the skull structure, chest cavity, molar structure, and the analysis of diet, nutrition and food science, his theory states that humanity made two major jumps:1. Australopithecine -> Homo Habilis by the introduction of scavenged meat into the diet, well pounded with early tools to make it palatable and digestible.2. Homo Habilis -> Homo Erectus by placing the vegetables and meat in the fire cook the food.He marries primatology with food science to show how cooked meat and vegetables greatly reduces the time to chew and digest food while keeping the exact same caloric and nutritional content of food. Experiments show feeding cooked and easy to chew food to animals, especially primates, results in very fat primates who always prefer cooked food to raw. Raw food consumes an enormous time to chew and requires large molars, which Homo Sapiens no longer has, but cooked food needs a smaller digestive system and smaller molars. It also frees Homo Sapiens from the task of chewing all day to doing other things — a rate of spending 60% of the day chewing down to less than 10%. Energy also is conserved in physiology — all animals across all species and genus with access to easily digested food have reduced gut size and put all that energy into increased brain cavity.Fire provides a whole host of other evolutionary advantages — more hours in the day available to be active, a source of protection at night, a source of warmth, a place for culture to grow and breed, and a clear division of labor between the sexes — hunting and cooking. Dr. Wrangham pulls dozens of examples from many different hunter-gatherer cultures worldwide, from Inuit to Australian aborigines to the !Kung of Africa to South Pacific Islanders, and finds commonalities that involve cooking, meat/vegetable balance, and division of labor and economic trade-offs. All revolves around fire and food.As for keeping a fire going, experiments show that chimpanzees can keep a fire going indefinitely. If a fire, captured, was brought in to a cave or another protected place and was properly venerated as the God it is, certainly a fire could be kept going. Homo Habilis was a tool-maker and tool-user — if Homo Habilis realized using the gold (pyrite-filled) stones to smash instead of the grey or brown ones, fire would start, and it had enough presence to repeat the process, fire could be made and kept going. It’s reasonable to believe mankind made fire and kept fire far before measured time.The arguments make sense and they are well sourced with tons of footnotes, a vast bibliography, and references pulled from other sources. The argument is also persuasive — we can find fire pits up to 800,000 years old and after that there is no trace but that means very little. If one little group became Homo Erectus and survived, we would never find evidence of that one small tribe who lived on. Too many evolutionary advantages match with the archeological evidence. Something happened at that boundary between Homo Habilis and Homo Erectus, something that allowed the gut to shrink and the brain to expand and Homo Erectus to spread all over the world. Keeping fire and cooking food makes sense and the arguments are reasonable.It’s a fairly short, quick read as these sorts of books go at 320 pages. Highly recommended to anyone interested in human evolution and/or food science."
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8089601-jodi,4,"The author makes an extremely convincing and logical argument for his theory that cooking food (as well as meat eating) helped make us who we are.Eating raw vegetables makes me feel terrible and has a huge metabolic cost. They just sit in my stomach like a rock - while properly cooked meat and vegetables are digested well. Nuts and seeds are better digested when soaked and then dried as well. I am tired of reading that raw vegetables contain all the enzymes we need to digest them easily, and that raw vegetables are far easier on the digestion than cooked ones. My own experience and that of many people I know, and books on the SCD diet, the GAPS diet and also books on nutrition such as 'Eat Fat, Lose Fat' and books by Dr Sherry Rogers and others just don't bear this out at all.Cooked vegetables are what you very often need, especially if you are very weak and ill and have digestive and/or metabolic issues. Cooked food is also much nicer to eat, easier to eat and tastes better. Don't believe the raw food hype! Especially don't believe the vegan or almost vegan raw food hype!Persevering with such an unnatural eating plan despite feeling awful on it just because you've been convinced (wrongly) that it is the healthiest possible way to eat for all of us, is not a good idea.Having said that, foods very high in enzymes (far more so than raw vegetables) such as sauerkraut and apple cider vinegar are very effective digestive aids, as are properly made enzyme supplements - which do survive the acid stomach environment. Fresh vegetables juices also digest very easily. So while raw vegetables may be low in enzymes as the author states, I disagree with the author that the right sort of enzymes can't make a big difference to digestion and that all enzymes are destroyed by the acid stomach.Just to be picky... I also disagree that some peoples have been very healthy eating 100% plant based diets and some on 100% meat based diets as the author states in the conclusion. (For more information on the lack of any truly vegan peoples, and the importance of animal products such as eggs to health and so on, see the Weston A. Price Foundation website.) The idea that we can be healthy on any type of macro-nutrient ratio we happen to prefer is just not correct. (See 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' and other books on fats and oils and the problems with very high carbohydrate diets and why high calorie intakes alone are not the cause of obesity as the author suggests.)I also disagree that animals can all do well on cooked food diets. (What about the research on calves being fed pasteurised and homogenised milk, and dying from it, or the Pottenger's cat experiments which showed that cats need raw foods?) Confusingly the author says animal don't and DO do well on cooked food diets.The book was very easy to read and quite brief, which I appreciated. I would much prefer a solid but short book than a longer one with huge amounts of padding.This book makes a very good case for eating real food and cooking your meats, eggs and vegetables.I agree with some other reviewers that the final chapter could have been a bit better but overall this book is a very good one and well worth reading. I'd recommend it, especially the first 4 chapters.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. "
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1194182-liz,4,"10/25/17 For more than half of this book I thought I would be giving it a 4 not because it was so engrossing, but because the science was so good. It was really well supported with everything from fossil evidence to modern studies of primates, to what happens to people who only eat raw food. I thought ""wow! This is one of the first books I've read about speculations on our origins that hasn't left me feeling they hadn't considered other alternative explanations. They've really looked at this from all angles."" Then about 2/3 of the way through they start talking about how cooking created pair bonding and gender roles. No. No on so many levels I have trouble deciding where to start. First off for all those ""traditionalists"" out there anatomically we are not a monogamous species, and I am not just talking about men liking variety. I mean apes have tiny penises despite their enormous size because they do all their sexual competing outside the womb. So if you like having a big penis thank you great great great^10 grandmother for being such a player. Second it has always struck me as odd that despite bonobos being even more closely related to us than chimps, chimpanzees are constantly used as the go to model for early hominin behavior. Chimps tend to be much more aggressive and solve things violently in a male dominated ""society."" Bonobos on the other hand are matriarchal and tend to solve tensions through sex. Despite having the same sexual dimorphism found in chimps (and one similar to humans), it's the females who boss the males not by being bigger, but by sticking together. Why is this not a viable model for early human behavior? Third comparing what hunter-gatherers who have been put under extreme pressure from encroachment on their lands do in unprecedented times does not tell us much about how hunter-gatherers of the past would have behaved. When the world as you know it seems to be ending it's not surprising many take an ""every man for himself"" stance. Wouldn't some of us?Okay, I'm done with this soapbox for now incase anyone needs it."
29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,3,"I'm not usually a fan of evolutionary psychology, since much of it is un-provable/un-falsifiable ""just-so"" stories. But some of the ideas in this book seem plausible and have good supporting evidence.Wrangham shows that true raw foodists are very rare. Even hunter-gatherer societies cook their food whenever they get a chance, and they even grind grains into flour and bake things (despite what all the ""Paleo diet"" pseudo-prehistory would have you believe).We seem to get much more out of digesting cooked food than raw: Cooking increases the glycemic index of starchy foods. There have been somewhat gross-sounding experiments comparing digestion of various foods in people whose guts are accessible due to operations or otherwise (the story of Beaumont and St.-Martin is incredible). Soft, well-processed foods make rats fatter than firmer versions of the same food. This part of the book may be useful to dieters and may help explain why less-processed foods tend to seem healthier.However, then Wrangham gets into the evolutionary stuff which is harder to support with evidence... First he suggests that cooking was responsible for a big increase in brain size in one of our ancestor species, which may be plausible enough; but then he talks about how cooking is responsible for the social structure of the family household unit, and it starts to get a bit far-fetched.It's interesting to consider that by creating mealtimes, cooking may have helped to create communities and social structure; and the stereotypical division of labor by sex (men hunt, women gather and cook) may have been the start of trade and economic exchange-based ""efficiency"" improvements. It may well have contributed to these things, but I don't know that I'd say cooking was singlehandedly *responsible* for them, the way Wrangham suggests."

This is when men and women's roles became entrenched (if the physically stronger sex was out hunting, he didn't have time to do the actual cooking and needed a steady and certain source of cooked food ready to consume when he was back) - Wrangham presents a case that the concept of monogamous pairings happened because of this codependence of both genders on developing a certain source of food. Hmmm... I guess this might have been one aspect of it. But one could argue that if all a males needed was a cook, why not just recruit children or weaker men who couldn't hunt? I guess I don't fully buy this argument but happily for 21st century gender politics no one has to do any cooking at all because of drive thrus and SeamlessWeb so men and women live in perfectly harmonious equality now... er..."

Wrangham's work with chimpanzees results in totally interesting asides where he discusses his observations about them and then reports back what he found out when he did what they did (chewed raw goat meat with a leaf, etc.). I was also really taken with his chapter on raw food-ism as one hears more and more about it these days. The surveys he looked at seem to suggest it is hard for humans (esp. those who don,t have access to out-of-season, high quality foods year round like we do) to thrive entirely on raw food. This surprised me. I like cooking, but I didn't think of it as not optional!However, at some point he did this thing that sociobiologists do that drives me nuts. He doesn't do this much, but when talking about the gendered division of labour in humans around food-gathering and cooking he looked for examples of females preparing food for males in other species and came up with a bug as the comparison. While the insect story is interesting (she apparently secretes a waxy substance and lets him ride around on her back to eat it!), I am just allergic to things that might seem to justify social arrangements as natural for us because a rat, bat or bug does it that way. Of course, it gives a whole new meaning to waxing one's back. Not just for body-builders it seems."

43,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69157986-jan,4,"This book was published in 2010, but has received a lot of attention also recently, and for good reason. Its author, Richard W. Wrangham, is a primatologist who has done extensive studies of chimpanzees with Jane Goodall at Gombe Stream National Park.. He has come to the conclusion that humans, with our naked skin, small digestive system and large brains could not have evolved without cooking, more specifically cooking with fire. This means that the current majority opinion, that we evolved large brains first and tamed fire later has it precisely upside down.Most of the book is concerned with hammering home the evidence that humans cannot live on raw food alone. Modern raw food faddists, even though they rely on industrialized food sources that are far more nutritious than what early hominins could hope to eat, are unable to get enough energy through their diet. We simply do not bite, chew, swallow or digest raw meat very well, and grasses that form a staple of our diets need heat treatment to give up its nutrients to us mammals without extra stomachs. This is a solid argument, but also one that begs for more research to confirm or deny it. Archaeologists and paleontologists have been unable to find convincing evidence for human control of fire going back more than around 600,000 years, when our ancestors Homo erectus lived across Africa and Eurasia. There is evidence of fire in association with early humans all the way back to 1.5Mya, but one fire does not prove that it was under control. To support the thesis that cooking made us, we need to push way beyond this and conclude that late Homo habilis, a much more primitive ancestor, tamed fire around 1.8 million years ago. There is no direct evidence for this. Maybe we should not expect to find evidence for a camp hearth so far into the past, but this makes many experts somewhat dismissive about the theory. This reader finds the argument very persuasive, if not fully convincing. But it's a fascinating theory: fire made cooking, and cooking made us. You are, indeed, what you eat."
44,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8082349-kevin,5,"Amazingly original research, which I happen to find convincing. I review the central claims here, https://kevinbinz.com/2019/02/24/cook...Wrangham presents his theory in a 1hr lecture here,https://youtu.be/LXorKMHQP44Besides the main argument, and regardless of whether cooking was invented 2 mya, Wrangham also gestures at the fact that hearths were primarily responsible for uniquely human social structures. Here’s a brief sketch of the gist:===In animal species, the mating system is adapted to the feeding system, rather than the other way around. No matter when it was invented, cooking certainly had enormous consequences on the development of human sociality. Cooking is a conspicuous and lengthy process. In the bush, the sight or smell of smoke reveals a cook’s location at a long distance, allowing hungry individuals who have no food to easily locate cooks in action. If the first cooks were temperamentally like chimpanzees, life would have been absurdly difficult for low-status hominids trying to cook a meal. In modern hunter-gatherer societies, cooking need not be a social activity, but a woman needs a man to guard her food, and she needs the community to back him up. A man relies on a woman to feed him, and on other men to respect his relationship with her. A primitive food-protection regime would have evolve rapidly among early cooks. It is frankly unclear to me how this regime would play out over time. But it seems likely that such interactions caused the emergence of human pair bonding. Indeed, it is interesting to note how easily traditional hunter-gatherers interpret feeding a man with a marriage proposal.No matter when cooking was invented, cooking also presumably played a role in changes to the human life history program. The key reason humans reproduce more than chimps is that we wean at 2-3 years instead of 4-5 years. This lifestyle change was eased by the availability of soft foods (vs raw tubers) for our babies. "
45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18249040-thark-n,3,"I am writing this months after having read it, so it will be brief. Summary: Wrangham is contending that the advent of cooking was a key driver in human evolution. While i was aware there were qualifiers to the ""a calorie is a calorie"" maxim recited throughout the internet's nutrition repositories (reddit), the role of cooking in caloric bio-availability was surprising. Wrangham begins by pointing to raw-foodists and raw pet food, showing studies that find eaters of unprocessed foods weighing much less than their cooking counterparts. Cooking food increases the calories absorbed into the body hugely in some circumstances, and even more so in humans, who lack proper meat-processing jaws that carnivores have, or the relatively enormous digestive apparatuses of most animals.. The relatives of humans spend much of the daylight hours just chewing, far more than any human. Cooking gives the more reward for the effort, thus saving calories and time. Thus, it's not surprising cooking is a universal in human cultures. Wrangham posits the immediate ancestors of Homo Erectus as the first consistent cooks. These creatures, advantaged by cooking, began an evolutionary line that has resulted in sapiens. The free time allocated was used for dividing the genders and letting the men search for scarcer and more valuable meats, while the women would find and cook gathered plants. High calories and easier digestion let human brains grow at the expense of gut size (is this why so many brilliant people were so sickly?). Cooking is a molder of humanity.I frankly wouldn't recommend the book to most people, it's somewhat disorganized and drones on too long, and if you've read reviews you've probably picked up the important points already."

Better diet means more energy used to meet the high energy costs of a large and well-developed brain, means better tools to obtain prey (and therefore meat) more efficiently, improved diet, more energy for brain, able to use/create fire due to increased intelligence, improved diet (v.i.a cooking), larger brain e.t.c. However, we didn't go full depth about exactly HOW the brain got more energy. Thankfully, this book covered that! Turns out, cooking food with fire decreases the digestion cost, as it makes the food softer, so there's energy left over to use on the brain. Mind = blown.This lead to decreased digestion time, decreased molars and premolars, a delicate jaw e.t.c as natural selection selected Homo's that ate cooked food (as they were more intelligent and were more likely to survive and pass on their alleles/genes to offspring).AMAZING.So happy I picked up this book!

Not only did it give us smaller guts and smaller mouths, but Wrangham also believes the cooking process set the stage for the sexual division of labor and largely monogamous pair-bonds. Although the biological claim is safer, both are fascinating to consider, for if they are true then a 'natural' diet for human beings is one which is cooked. Additionally, if this is the case then a cultural adaption has manipulated biology, and in a profound way.The genius of cooking is that it allows us to maximize the potential calorie intake of a given foodproduct. Raw food is tough; herbivorous animals in particular spend their entire day grazing and chewing. Their intestines must work throughout the day, and often into the night, breaking down ingested food into the fuel the body so desperately needs. But all that work takes energy itself. Meat eaters have an easier time of it, but muscle tissue is resilient; thick, tough, and tightly connected. At the outset, Wrangham establishes that the ease of digestion is fundamentally important, citing cases in which two sets of animals were given identical amounts of the same food; rats, for instance, given a set number of food pellets. Each group's calorie count was identical, but one group had ""soft"" pellets, or pellets in which air had been inserted. The group eating soft pellets put on muscle mass far more quickly than the group chewing on hard pellets; in fact, the soft-pellet group became obese. In processing and cooking food -- grinding seeds, tenderizing meat by pounding it with rocks, and then heating items -- we greatly reduce the amount of work our bodies must do to digest them. The more processed they are, the more efficiently we can take in the calories...and while easy calories have become a problem to us now, in the days prior to agriculture it was a godsend.Cooking not only gave us a competitive edge, it altered our physiology. We no longer needed huge teeth for grinding raw muscle, nor expansive intestines for long-term digestion...and when those became smaller, we had more energy to invest in brains. Although Wrangham doesn't speculate on the result of increased intelligence and leisure time, one can assume the combination had a dramatic effect on human culture. Fundamentally, the author contends that the division of labor roles could have never transpired without cooking. Raw food requires so much time to chew and digest that men wouldn't have been able to spend their days hunting (or lounging around, as the case might be) if they could not have come back to the tribe camp with a cooked meal waiting for them. Since women, the gatherers, provided the economic foundation of the tribe -- supplying food if and when the men failed to deliver -- one might think this gave them the power. Instead, cooking became a liability. Women tending food at a fire needed to protect it, lest the food be stolen. Wrangham believes that pair bonds arose for this reason: women provided the food, and men protected it. Although this is more of a stretch than the biological claims, requiring more inference on our part, it offers a count to the usual sex-driven conception of pair bonds. Time and again Wrangham documents tribes that don't seem to care if married women sleep with other men...but woe betide them if they cook for other men.Wrangham ends by chastising nutritionists for missing the point about food, and particularly for believing every food delivers a set amount of calories or nutrients, when that amount greatly varies depending on how the food has been processed and cooked. Given the obesity epidemic, the relationship between processing and calories is certainly one worth our consideration...and Wrangham's work is wide open to lay readers, so dig in.Related:ScienceFriday interview with Richard Wrangham regarding Catching FireGuns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond"

[disclaimer: I'm naturally a quasi-vegetarian, although I eat plenty of fish, eggs & poultry] Wrangham's thesis is a fairly simple one: it's not ""man"" the hunter but rather ""man"" the fire-tender and cook who best explains the change from australopithecine (habiline)to human (homo erectus). As cooking increases the amount of energy our bodies obtain from food, less energy has to be expended in chewing and digesting raw foods, which allows us to have smaller intestines than our ancestors the great apes and frees up energy for our larger brains. (""Cooked food is better than raw food because life is mostly concerned with energy. So from an evolutionary perspective, if cooking causes a loss of vitamins or creates a few long-term toxic compounds, the effect is relatively unimportant compared to the impact of more calories."") Wrangham posits a secondary claim that is both intriguing and more debatable. He proposes cooking as the technical invention that ""made possible one of the most distinctive features of human society: the modern form of the sexual division of labor."" He goes on to say that while men have historically engaged in cooking when alone or for ceremonial purposes, domestic cooking has been an almost exclusively female activity. And it is to the dominant male's need to secure his source of cooked food and the physically ""smaller and weaker"" female's need for a ""food guard"" that we can attribute the advent of patriarchy. Thus, in the author's view, the advent of patriarchy dates not from the invention of agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago, but rather much earlier, at the very beginnings of our species. I find this argument a bit reductive as it fails to explain how human females came to be ""smaller and weaker"" in the first place. If sexual selection prompts humans of both sexes to choose the most evolutionarily fit and healthy members of the opposite sex for reproduction and if size and strength are accurate indicators of such fitness and health, then it would make sense that females would choose larger and stronger males as mates and that over time, size differences between the sexes would increase. However, wouldn't males also choose larger and stronger females as more reproductively fit with the result of equalizing size and strength between the genders? That said, I can't help finding some amusement in the author's statement that ""females feed males to reward them for behaving well."" How Cooking Made Us Human presents a strong argument for cooked food as THE cultural innovation that resulted in humans, while leaving some questions unanswered regarding the advent of patriarchy with its division of labor and attribution of social power and status according to gender."

Sex is easier to get than someone to tend to his house and hearth.* Lipids constitute fat which is solid at room temperature and oil which is liquid at room temperature.* Fat and protein can be isolated. Everything else is assumed to be Carbohydrates unless it doesn't burn, then it's inorganic.* Food nutrition labels are base don the Atwater general convention.* Metabolism increased by max 25% when we eat because eating is costly .* Protein costs more to digest than carbs, fat is the cheapest to digest.* Lean people have higher cost of digestion than obese people.* How finely the grain is milled affects digest ability, with almost all the flour digested when finely milled. Less milling can lead to up to 30% of the food excreted, unused.* Raw food produce less net energy than cooked foods, with a higher proportion of raw food passed through the body largely unused.* Atwater system provides estimates but don't reflect the realities of digestion.* Atwater system assumes particle size doesn't matter and cooking does nothing to impact freed energy from food.* A Bomb calorimeter is used to measure food calories.* Rats got fat when food pellets were soft, and given the same calories as other hard pellet rats."

Cooking vastly increases the number of calories available to us through the same food, and freed us up to become human. The book goes over all sorts of evidence for this. It starts by describing physiological factors, such as how small our mouths, teeth and guts are, and how we simply couldn’t survive on raw food alone. Our closest primate relatives basically spend all day eating, whereas we spend just a few hours of each day eating. The author speculates that cooking was responsible for our second large leap in brain size / body size (the first being a result of walking upright). There is some discussion over raw food diets, and how people basically starve in those conditions. For example, women stop menstruating, and all people generally feel hungry, all the time. There is even some discussion of survival stories, of people who were stranded. Those who ate raw food were able to subsist, but always felt hungry despite eating animal protein all the time, whereas those who could cook their food thrived (like the guy who was the model for Robinson Crusoe).The rest of the book then goes on to discuss the societal implications of cooking, namely that husband/wive pairing exists because it is the best balance of keeping everyone fed. On their own, left to hunt, men would frequently starve because of the irregularity of game catches. Women, on the other hand, lack the ability to defend themselves. Together, however, a woman can provide a base subsistence of foraged food that is cooked, while the man can concentrate on hunting and providing the high value meals. The author supports this theory by looking at numerous primitive tribe populations around the world, and how the link between man and woman is defined by the food stability it gives. There are numerous instances of how even sexual infidelity fails to shake this bond, yet a woman’s failure to provide a cooked meal can result in beatings."
104,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940878-harley-gee,4,"I learned a lot about food in this book. Cooked food vs uncooked food. Never really thought about it before. Wrangham argues that it was the taming of fire that led to cooking that then led to dietary changes that made humanity possible. Hominids from 2 million years ago had relatively small brains. Subsequent species show increased brain size. Modern humans date from around 200,000 years ago. Wrangham argues that it was cooking that provided the energy needed by increasing brain sizes. He argues that cooking enables more efficient digestion (cooking makes digestion quicker and less energy taxing) and more complete (a higher proportion of cooked food is actually digested). Apparently this contradicts orthodoxy. Wrangham argues that little enough attention has been paid to the difficulty of digesting raw foods. And the conventional view is that modern humans learned to cook after they mastered fire, some time in the last 200,000 years. But a date closer to 2,000,000 years ago helps explain the changes in facial structure, tooth size, as well as brain size. Cooking is the key. Our hominid ancestors could cook. It is not some discovery by our clever homo sapiens ancestors. It is the discovery that enabled our ancestors to become clever.Wrangham also theorizes that cooking is fundamental to human social roles. Men become the hunters. Women become the cooks. He goes to some length explaining how consistent this is across cultures. Wrangham points out that only Homo Sapiens couples share their food. Chimps, bonobos, and gorillas do not. This sharing is an indicator of how fundamental cooking is to being human because sharing is necessary when the female is charged with cooking what the male kills. Cooking is important in defining sex roles.Catching fire is a thought provoking read. Makes you want to slow down and chew your food completely as you consider that we are because we cook. I like this idea. Tip generously. "

The book is meant to be skimmed for knowledge, not as novel. (Like I was force to do)So overall the book is alright. I have a slight interest in anthology. But my interest in food is lacking.

While the origin of fire and cooking are certainly discussed in this book, the true story here is how humanity has benefited from cooking, and how it has aided us on the evolutionary path to making us the dominant species on the planet. Wrangham boils it down (pun intended!) to energy and how when foods (especially meats) are cooked, more energy is generated from consuming them. The author scientifically breaks this down by analyzing the energy gained from raw meats as opposed to cooked, as well as vegetables, revealing the problems that some vegetarians and vegans can have in needing to make sure they get enough energy from the foods they consume.Reading Catching Fire will educate you in a number of ways: you will learn the importance of our ancestors learning to cook foods and further are evolutionary development, but you will also learn why it is we cook foods – on a biological level – and how it can change how we grow and develop, both physically and intellectually.For more reviews, check out the BookBanter site."
107,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4069822-aaron,0,"An interesting read. I did not understand the critique mentioned on wikipedia (There is also evidence that human brain size has decreased by 8 percent in the last 10000 years, correlated with increased consumption of starchy grains following the invention of agriculture – this contradicts Wrangham's theory, that in an earlier period in human evolution an increased consumption of starchy foods (cooked tubers) led to an increase in brain size. - [they are arguing two separate conditions. Increased consumption of starchy foods via cooked tubers were improving the net food consumption patterns. The increased carbohydrates over the past 10'000 years, especially at the begining of the agricultural and into the industrial revolution was associated with a reduction in the net food consumption patterns due to the replacement of nutrient dense foods, meat etc, with poor quality carbohydrates that made up the majority of the daily food intake.])The preaching at the end, and quoting Michael Pollan, was stunningly ineffective. Critiques about the Atwater factors have been going on for many years, and Richards argument, and even his desire for ileal digestibility measures, are not strong. Net energy remaining after digestion will be an impossible task to measure, as each meal will contain differences due to the previous meals influence (second meal effect etc), the best we can do is provide the most accurate representation of the energy provided to the body (Geoff Livesey has been working with this for years) and the energy utilized for digestion is on the other side of the equation, energy expenditure.

108,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3527169-joy,3,"I picked up this book after hearing someone talk about it in an all-staff meeting at work, because the concept sounded interesting. The argument that cooking food is what made apes turn into humans is an interesting one, and is well supported by the information, theories, and documentation laid out by the author. He covers a wide variety of ways in which cooking has shaped human development, from the physical changes (smaller guts and teeth) to the societal changes (marriage and women cooking in return for safety), with quite a lot of data from both the past and the present to support his claims.While the topic was interesting, I found the book rather hard to read, as can be inferred by the fact it took me two months to get through it. I can't quite put my finger on it, as the writing style wasn't particularly dry or boring, but it was rather lackluster and at times quite repetitive as the author put forth example after example in similar ways. Usually I can pick out the problem and how it could be solved, but this particular book has me a bit stymied on that tack, so perhaps the lesson is that it's just bland enough to be a slog, but not bad enough for there to be things to fix.I did very much enjoy the subject matter and the beginnings of each chapter, and I think that that the author's premise of how cooking was the driver for human development is very plausible. It's worth a read, or perhaps at least a skim, for the information and theories contained therein and is a worthwhile nonfiction read."
109,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4716028-rob-reed,4,"Wrangham caused a commotion in the biological evolution community a few years ago by proposing that the advent of cooking is what instigated many of our modern-day evolutionary traits. This is in contrast to current thinking which credits theories like 'group selection' for our mostly human condition - such as division of labor withing male/female units and altruism. Wrangham takes this opportunity to explore his thesis - that learning to cook is what instigated many of our current human like conditions/behaviors/biology - in great detail. He's a Harvard prof and some of his thinking is contrary to conventional wisdom. But then again, it's very difficult to explain how certain aspects of humanness came to be without much direct evidence beyond a few hominid fossils. He does a great compare/contrast with modern day apes and studies which seem, to a non-biologist like me, to be rather convincing.Nevertheless, Wranghan's theory is fascinating - that merely learning to cook caused a waterfall off changes within the human species, all the way back pre-Eructus, a led to what we are today. He is a good writer, succinct and makes his point rather quickly, if not repeatedly. Interesting modern fossil finds continue to support his theory, and while cooking may not be the single reason for our current state, it surely had a very large role to play - more so than most prior evolutionists give credit for.For those interested in biological evolution - it's a great briefer, short read on this interesting theory.

110,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33195772-aaron-redman,5,"The thesis of this book is simple: cooking foods was the key innovation that separated us and put us down the evolutionary path to today's humans. What is most admirable was how tight and focused Wrangham was in focusing on elaborating and defending his argument without digressions, using accessible language, and avoiding too much repetition. My experience is that academics writing this type of books typically ad at least 100 extra pages which you will not find here.The key insight for food system Sustainability is that humans are evolutionaryily adapted to eating a wide range of diets, as long as the food is primarily cooked (I very much enjoyed the thorough debunking of raw foods). This is great news for Sustainability as it means that functionally we can choose to structure our diets around the most ecologically sound crops without sacrificing our own nutrition and health. The best example is meat, which is widely recognized as the part of our diet with the greatest negative impact on our planet. If meat was as central to our evolution as many had previously believed phasing consumption down would seem in insurmountable challenge. If on the other hand cooking is the key to our evolution than I see the prospects for reducing meat consumption to be much better.In fact that has been my experience in going vegetarian. It is learning how to cook this new diet that was the challenge, once you can do that meat just seems superfluous.

I got the impression that at some point he had been wronged by Richard Wrangham, or was at the very least envious of the publishing history of the book. Stepping away from that anecdote there are a few problems with the book's hypothesis. Tubers could have been gathered, but to gather enough to maintain the body's caloric requirements would have been time consuming, and not always worthwhile, especially considering that bone marrow would have been more easily gotten and high in fat and protein. I don't find Wrangham's analysis of modern hunter-gather societies to be particularly valuable considering that the world he's trying to analyze was far different from today's. There were then extent animals that could have provided a whole lot of bone marrow far easier than it would be to gather and cook tubers. I feel Wrangham falls into the trap that many anthropologists have: there are no currently existing ""primative"" societies that emulate early man. We all live in the modern era. If you want to analyze past societies, you have to dig and base your knowledge on their remnants. Unfortunately for Wrangham there's no archaeological evidence to support his hypothesis which doesn't necessarily negate his hypothesis, though it does make it less likely. It is an original hypothesis that doesn't leave the mind easily and there may indeed be some knowledge to gain from it."

That said, Wrangham has written an excellent and provocative book. Basically, his (apparently radical, although I don't know enough mainstream evolutionary theory to know) theory is that learning to cook, thereby getting more nutritional value out of food for a lowered digestive cost, is what spurred the evolutionary churning that made humans out of apes. He employs tons of evidence, all fascinating. There are a lot of interesting side stories to this: how raw food diets are bullshit, because the energy costs of digesting that stuff alone are so high, how nutritional science doesn't actually give us accurate calorie counts because of how complicated our digestive processes are, and finally (I think most importantly), how cooking caused patriarchy:""The idea that cooking led to our pair-bonds suggests a worldwide irony. Cooking brought huge nutritional benefits. But for women, the adoption of cooking has also led to a major increase in their vulnerability to male authority. Men were the greater beneficiaries. Cooking freed women's time and fed their children, but it also trapped women into a newly subservient role enforced by male-dominated culture. Cooking created and perpetuated a novel system of male cultural superiority. It is not a pretty picture.""No kidding. Fuck that noise!"

This one is more narrowly focused, so I felt like there's much less meat (haha) to extract from it. The basic idea:* as proto-humans diverged from chimps, they started to eat starchy roots; their brains got bigger* then they started eating meat; the improved diet was good and could start reducing gut size; their brains got bigger* they discovered and finally tamed fire; the heat could keep them warm at night so they could lose body hair; their brains got bigger* they started cooking; this led to far less time needed for eating as nutrients were easier to digest; their brains got even bigger** this allowed allowed sex roles to develop as females gathered and cooked while males hunted. the males couldn't have afforded to spend all day hunting in case they didn't bag anything...they'd miss too many hours chewing to keep daily caloric intake high enough** their brains got biggerThat's kinda it. He also begins with argument that raw food is harder to digest etc., but none of that felt really controversial to me. Cooler discussions were trying to pin down when cooking really began, how it may have come about."

The author believes that the acquiring of the ability to control fire and cook food is what made us human. Cooked food is very much more digestible than raw food which wrings much more energy out of the food we ingest; enables us to spend time doing other things than chew (apes spend 6 to 8 hours a day chewing!!); enables our digestive system to be smaller than that of apes; and frees up more caloric energy for the energy-hungry brain.It's all very much conjectural and there's probably no way to prove it, but certainly he makes a good case for it. It's very well annotated. The back third of the book is all documentation of anthropological studies, animal studies; primate studies and nutritional data.At the close of the book, Wrangham introduces a problem with how nutritionists calculate the food value of our food. It turns out that the actual food value is very much relative and affected by whatever else is in the bolus of food in our system at any given time and by how the food is prepared. People who exist on a raw food diet always lose weight, even when the calories they ingest equal calories ingested by people eating cooked food. That's because raw food is harder to digest and all the food value isn't extracted. For me the theory was a chicken and egg problem. Did we become smarter because we cooked and released more energy for the brain, or did we learn to cook because we became smarter? "

Now we're apes with small lips, mouths, teeth and guts... and big brains. Coincidence? Dick thinks not.According to him, we learned how to cook by first learning how to control fire. This allowed us to sleep on the ground at night (instead of in trees) and turned us from Homo habilus (tree-climbing, raw-food-eating dimwits) into Homo erectus (ground-dwelling, cooked-food-eating troglodytes). Controlling fire and cooking also engendered the division of labor between the sexes and accelerated our penchant for complex cooperation. Once we learned to cook our food, men could spend their days hunting and not have to worry about lost chewing time [raw-food-eating modern apes (chimps and gorillas) have to spend most their days chewing and thus can't hunt much-- and because every ape must chew for himself, no division of labor is possible:]. With cooking, women didn't have to worry about lost chewing time either and could thus spend their days gathering and cooking. In the end, cooking gave us several more free hours per day to do other things, which led us to socialize more, think more and, with the help of easily digestable, energy-abundant cooked food, grow our brains. This is a great book. I recommend it to all apes who eat cooked food."

While this lifestyle would seem a key point to address in light of his overall hypothesis (that it was the use of fire on our early food sources that helped up to evolve the way we did) it doesn't need to be at the detriment of his argument. He spends more time in the first quarter of the book systematically pointing out everything that's bad about raw food and no time discussing his very interesting premise. I suppose I could have stuck with the book, seen if it got any better, but why waste my time? The other thing that bothered me is that the author would frequently cite studies or throw out numbers without any citation. Perhaps it's too ""librarian"" of me, or too nit picky, but if you're writing a non-fiction book, shouldn't you be backing up the numbers you're presenting? I want to know WHAT theses studies were about, WHEN they were conducted, WHO was part of them, WHO produced/funded them, HOW were the results interpreted, and WHAT was the conclusion. Again, call me picky, but I am more likely to agree with your argument and assessment if you provide me with legitimate information, rather then unsupported and unsubstantiated numbers.And for the record, I'm not a raw foodist or even a vegetarian."

His hypothesis: cooking food was a primary driver in the evolution of the genus Homo. He builds his case mostly by inference, which is about all one can do given the lack of hard archeological evidence. But his inferences are nonetheless impressive and more robust than I might have initially guessed. One of the things I liked most was that the author considered what life might have been like for early man in some fundamental ways, such as how Homo erectus must have slept—was it in the trees, like other apes, (not likely, given anatomical knowns) or on the ground, and since it was probably on the ground, how did he protect himself? There are other implications to his hypothesis, such as if early man was cooking, he must have controlled fire. He looked at other factors I’ve seldom seen in my study of anthropology, like cross species comparisons of mouth and stomach volume, and how much time is spent eating food. These kinds of considerations lead to fascinating speculation about the odd animal that was a primitive version of us, yet very much like us. It’s mindboggling to consider that these proto-humans thrived for nearly a couple million years."

Most of that study's participants were at a chronic energy deficit, and a number of the women suffered from amenorrhea...and they had access to all the foodstuffs and processing devices of the modern world!The physiology bits were fascinating: the trade-off between energy use in the gut and energy use in the brain, the differing jaw and teeth formations.There's quite a bit of just-so-story of the kind that one often finds with evolutionary psychology & biology, but it seems more carefully constructed than some. The chapter(s) on cooking and the evolution of the pair-bond relationship are troubling but hard to refute, at least by me. (Cooking leading pretty much directly to patriarchy.

His primary hypothesis is that we have relatively small ""guts,"" and that means we spend less energy on digestion. What that opened for us was the ability to spend energy on the brain, that greedy organ. His hypothesis is that controlling fire, and using it for cooking, allowed for the evolution of the modern big brained biped. He spends a lot of time talking about how cooking helps break down all sorts of food, whether meats, or starches. He also mentions a lot of other interesting facts, such as the obese often have lower metabolic costs for digestion. While it isn't clear whether this was the cause or the effect of the obesity, it is interesting, to see that yes, some person may eat just what you eat, and even similarly prepare it, and have a huge difference in net caloric intake. It's also interesting to recognize how recent a phenomenon that obesity is, it's only since World War II, that so much of the world gets enough to too many calories consistently. Must read.

He is able to read thousands of reports of research, condense them and translate them into non-specialist English and enjoy it. Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human"" proposes answers to several interesting evolutionary questions. What happened in the taxon Hominidae to explain the evolution of humans? A strong argument can be made for the inexplicable advent of symbolic communication. Another can be made for intelligence arising from brain size. Wrangham's thesis is that cooking and cooked food explain human evolution. He argues quite persuasively that cooking led to a smaller digestive tract and a larger brain in human ancestors. He further argues that cooking was the basis for gender-based division of labour into those who hunted or scavenged and those who cooked and kept the fire. He concludes that this explains modern pair bonding and marriage. He is also very hard on modern food-fad advocates of raw diets, which could turn one easily into a gibbon or a gorilla.

Most of it is an anthropology study determining when in the evolutionary chain humans starting cooking their food, and the implications to society. What makes it good is that it brings together several branches of science to support the theory, and although a bit technical, is well written.It pulls together several things that once put together seem obvious (like much of our food, like most grains, are not digestible if not cooked). The other is that it takes much more energy to digest raw foods (vegetable or animal), and that as humans, our digestive systems are not designed to eat large quantities of raw foods (it also supports this with some studies done on raw-foodists). The key take-away for me was that no one has a good understanding of the net energy value of foods (calories in the food minus calories needed to digest minus what is not digested). Small studies show that both cooking foods and the form of the food (for example whole or ground) impact how much energy and nutrients are absorbed by the body, as well as how much energy is needed to digest the food. Which supports one of my key beliefs on nutrition: there is still a lot we don't know."

It was fascinating to me how much more energy you can get out of cooked foods than raw foods. Other than people in industrialized countries with big supermarkets, it's actually very hard for humans to thrive on raw food; we have a much smaller digestive system (and much weaker jaw muscles) than other primates and hence can't absorb as many nutrients or calories from raw food (in other words, those dieters eating salads all the time are right: if you want to lose weight, stick with the raw foods- you just can't digest them as well). The other fascinating thing was that cooking also gave us more free time - chimpanzees (and other large primates) spend *6 hours* a day chewing their raw food (which I read while scarfing down my well-cooked lunch in ten minutes). The only problem I had with the book was that I kept wanting to eat things while I was reading it. All in all a very interesting book.  "

Now, I haven't taken it the second step and researched his references - yet - but it strikes a chord.

This is an interesting idea --- that we became human when we learned to cook our food. Wrangham postulates that it was the cooking of food that led to the shift in the skulls in homo erectus. The big jaw muscles that were necessary in earlier forms to chew raw meat and vegetables were no longer necessary, shifting the insertion point from the top of the skull to its present location at the top of the ear. This allowed the skull to grow for a bigger brain. TThe big stomach and small intestine of the other apes that eat raw food also shrank as less time was needed for digestion. As less time was needed for digestion, less energy was required by the gut to process the food, leaving more energy for the development of a bigger brain! He also has several chapters about how women became subservient to men as they became the cooks. This part is less compelling, but probably true also. It leads the patriarchy way back!"

The author explains everything in terms of evolution, meaning whether or not it gave a reproductive advantage or a survival advantage. I think this is important to know because otherwise you might find yourself disagreeing in the first few pages. The second half of the book focuses on social aspects, which was interesting and disheartening at the same time, because it brought up huge implications of male superiority that makes the feminist in me angry. By the end of the book, I was surprisingly more interested in eating a greater proportion of raw food. Not quite what you would expect from the title and from some of the seemingly raw-food bashing that goes on in the first couple chapters, and definitely not what I expected to take home from the book's message.

While the explanation of the Atwater system for the calculation of calories was interesting, the author had to take the current 'war on obesity' into the book, and kept adding sentences on how we could not trust the calorie tables and we should develop better ways to calculate calories because so many people are fat and should lose weight 'for their health'. Better he kept to his specialty, because the information would be just as valid without those additions.

Wrangham does a very nice job of laying out the digestive chemistry and philology of the human body, along with archaeological and anthropological evidence for evidence of butchering, control of fire, changes in cooking methods — from meat on the flame to nuts and seeds buried in coals to hot stone heating of water to early ovens– and the growth in the size of the cranial capacity in the homo line — from 350 cubic centimeters in australopithecines to 1,200 cc in modern humans. - See more at: http://www.allinoneboat.org/#sthash.n..."

We became hairless to run further while staying cool by getting enough calories to keep warm at night by cooking. Both the fire itself and the extra calories afforded in the processing of meat by cooking created physiological and cultural/behavioral changes that made us the smarter primates we are today. Cooking also affords time: non-human primates spend a good portion of their day chewing to get calories. Cooking softens food and makes more foods edible. Processing foods makes more calories in a given food available over raw food. It's only today that a raw food diet can be sustainable. For millions of years, we adapted, indeed evolved, to require cooked food to function. Man did not discover or invent cooking. Cooking created man. "

Prior to reading this book, I would have assumed that fire is really nice to have and makes life a lot easier but not necessary for human life because humans presumably were able to live without it before it was discovered. Wrangham argues convincingly, however, that fire and cooking are what allowed early hominids to evolve into humans: humans evolved to eat cooked food and would not actually be able to survive as a species without it. I enjoyed reading about the ways in which cooked food allowed humans to become human, for instance by freeing up the energy apes need for digestion and allowing it to go to our brains, and about how the development of cooking corresponded with the development of gender roles.

His sociological arguments are most provocative and perhaps open to argument. He says that the division of labor we see in human societies (men hunt, women cook) is not a benign sharing of the work load but one created by the dominant males, forcing the females into the less valued jobs. He even argues that marriage came out of this division and that important aspects of this institution are also forced.I thought his evidence here was a bit forced but I couldn't help but think of Brownmiller's seminal book Men, Women, and Rape which has an even more controversal theme.

Wrangham uses this book to support his general thesis that man's evolution has been closely intertwined with his/her ability too cook. Using excellent and well thought through support, Wrangham shows the enormous benefits that early man derived from the ability to cook (smaller stomachs, larger brains, and most importantly, more free time) and shows how those advantages allowed humans to take a uniquely different evolutionary path than other animals. For example, the author notes that even our closest primate relatives spend at least 6 hours a day chewing food which severely limits their daily options and essentially chaining them to a set daily routine. As man began to cook food, we essentially broke this chain and set in place the evolutionary pressures that created who we are today. Anyway - great read, highly recommended. "

A case is made for the origin of our species being connected with the use of fire to cook food, which as a form of pre-digestion allows us to get sustenance with far less effort than other simians and similar mammals. Our cultural norms involving family and village group in society have evolved with our reduced need for digestion (it takes us an hour to digest that which other animals take ten or more hours). This frees humans to pursue other ends besides food gathering, and also has created a similar family cultural behavior in most or all human cultures. The man hunts and brings home, the woman cooks for him in exchange. Sharing of food by the woman in exchange for meat from the man creates a partnership even more-so than sex. The changing of homo fossils and campfire sites show that this evolution allowed us to develop our current brain size. Many examples are given lending credence to these theses. "

That this freed up time for human beings to do other things, as they weren't spending all of their time trying to eat and digest raw food. Along with this he has some long boring chapters about the division of labor amongst the sexes and how women get stuck cooking while men can do as they please. This all seemed rather pointless.

(Not necessarily the wisest move we've ever made given the current state of the world...;) ) Cooking food gives us more calories, is easier and faster to digest, and may well be responsible for the initial division of labour between the sexes! More calories leads to bigger brains, and, as the debate raging in Congress over the federal debt becomes more ridiculous, leads to fewer brain cells being used to survive --pure evolutionary genius!

Unexpectedly, however, I found the detailed discussions about how raw versus cooked food is metabolized by the body--and its consequences for animals/evolution--utterly fascinating. I had no idea that, for example, a banana provides different amounts of calories when it is sliced, mashed, pureed, frozen, roasted, or eaten raw. I've always assumed that a banana ultimately has about 100 calories no matter what you do with it. Not so. And, according to Wrangham, that fact is ultimately how we were able to ""become human."""

Wrangham argues that ""catching fire"" led to the development of ""family"" structures wherein females of the species tended the fires, kept them burning, and cooked the meat that faithful, protective males brought ""home.""

Favorite argument:Without cooking, primitive man would not have had time to hunt, gather and eat.

The discovery of cooking allowed our guts to become smaller and our brains to become bigger. Humans have evolved towards the consumption of cooked food to the point where consuming a strictly raw food diet (including meat) causes loss of sex drive in men, and loss of menstruation in half of women who try it.

At the end of the book I found myself in agreement with the author because he went into fine detail and didn't leave a stone unturned, but the only thing was that during a few stages of the novel I found myself forcing myself to keep reading rather than casually flowing at a meandering pace.

He argues that cooking is really what makes us who we are and gave birth to social life and human behavior as we know it. I find him to make some pretty broad based generalizations but overall his theories aren't far-fetched and would be hard to argue with.

A Harvard biological anthropologist, he makes a convincing case for the importance of cooking in the human diet, finding a connection between our need to eat cooked food in order to survive and our preference for soft foods. The popularity of Wonderbread, the digestion of actual lumps of meat, and the dangers of indulging our taste buds all feature in this expository romp through our gustatory evolution."

I had my doubts going into it, as I think anyone should about the endless procession of books subtitled 'How (insert favorite random modern human behavior) Makes Us Human' or something to that effect. Is the ability to cook really what shaped humanity? Probably not. But Wrangham does give a lot of pretty convincing evidence that cooked food contributed to plenty of adaptations we now recognize as uniquely human. He also gives a convincing, if not totally necessary, refutation of the Raw Food Movement. As if it really needs refuting. The sections on the brain proteins are well worth reading in themselves if one doesn't want to read the whole book, but the book is readable if so."

Though the book is heavily referenced, his style is mostly anecdotal, and I feel he didn't argue most of his points fully, leaving many open questions and counterarguments incompletely reubutted. Nevertheless, it's an easy read and an interesting concept that is relevant today.The fact that stuck out most in my mind is that you get roughly twice the energy from a cooked potato as from a raw potato. Just because two foods have the same amount of listed calories does not mean humans will actually absorb the same amount of energy from them. Concepts like these are extremely relevant today."

The theory, and I am going to mangle it, is that having a woman to cook allowed a man to be a more successful hunter, thus beginning the family economics that we inherit today. I am glad we know at least one family where the father does all the cooking, just because rules are meant to be broken.

Take one fact from the book: Chimps spend six hours a day chewing. Can you imagine how different life would be if we had to do the same thing?! Needless to say, we wouldn't have ever had the time develop agriculture and eventually civilization without the free time and energy available that we don't spend masticating our food.There are several great ideas in the book, nothing life-changing, but still very interesting.

The book is chock full of lots of fascinating factoids, such as how chimps spend ~6hrs/day chewing, but cooking has allowed us to spend more time on activities other than acquiring food and eating. The implications that Wrangham draws are very far-reaching, as he describes how cooking enabled men to spend more time hunting, leading to a sexual division of labor, food-sharing, and consequently pair-bonding.

Having read some of the primary literature cited, I found this book to be fascinating, not just for evolutionary aspects, but also in relation to current approaches to food and nutrition. The only reason this book does not receive 5 stars, is that I felt the author pushed his theory into a questionable reality in describing what he thought were the sequence of events leading to human speciation."
153,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1469486-anne,3,"Interesting although overly long. The big take-away is that foods of the same caloric value are not equal. How they are prepared can let us absorb more energy (calories). Over processed and thoroughly cooked foods are easier to digest and our body absorbs more energy from these foods. As an extreme example, it's hard to get enough calories to survive by eating only raw food. But cook it, make it mushy or soft (think baby food or fast food or alcohol) and we get almost all the calories. Explains why it's easy to loose weight by cutting out wine/beer. Supports Weight Watchers new points counting system. An apple with the same calories as a glass of apple juice will not be as efficiently absorbed and is worth less points. Makes sense. "

This fueled -- among other things -- brain power. There are some issues with his theory -- namely, the earliest dating of controlled fire is some time after the metabolic changes he posits.

And I was frustrated that he didn't include a discussion of the appendix, supposedly a vestigial organ which may have helped digest cellulose.

Wrangham thinks that by the time our ancestors, Homo erectus, evolved (1.8 million years ago), they had control of fire and were using it to cook their food. Cooking softens food, making it more easily digested. Consequently, our ancestors did not have to eat as much or as often, freeing them up to hunt more. Evolutionary effects of cooking lead to smaller teeth, a smaller digestive system, and a larger brain. The smaller digestive system freed up energy created by our bodies that is now needed to maintain our larger brains. These changes were in place about half a million years ago when Homo erectus became Homo heidelbergensis."

The central idea (that modern humans evolved to be dependent on cooked food, and the additional energy made available by this change fueled our development) is an interesting one, but I felt like more evidence would have helped to establish his case a bit better."

Cooking food reduced the need for big teeth, jaws, mouths and guts mainly because it takes much less energy to digest soft food. The extra calories we ingested were directed to building a bigger brain. Fire changed man socially too and brought about sexual division of labour-and more work for women-but also helped bring humans together into family groups. Excellent stuff here that makes you think.
