0,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,5,"This might be described as an Oliver Sacks primer. I’ve enjoyed it. Dr. Sacks was known for his fondness for the footnote, which is little in evidence here. So this might be a very good place to start for those new to his work. Moreover, it has a little taste of each of his books, among them: Migraine, A Leg to Stand On, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, An Anthropologist On Mars, The Island of the Colorblind, Hallucinations, and Awakenings, his fascinating magnum opus in which the footnotes sometimes rival the main text in length. Sacks’s hobby was botany, which makes his insights in the chapter “Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers” irresistible. On studying an orchid with a footlong nectary, Darwin predicted a moth with a matching proboscis would eventually be found which was that blossom’s particular pollinator. “More than 130 years after Darwin first suggested that a large moth pollinated an African orchid, his hypothesis was confirmed. It took quite some time, but quite clearly Darwin's prediction, based on extremely limited evidence but bolstered by his understanding of his own new theory of natural selection, was correct.” (The Guardian 2 Oct 2013.)The last chapter, “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science,” speaks to the absense of historical consciousness in science. This area is now starting to be addressed, but for most of the 20th century it was not. To tell the tale Sacks revisits the story of his own injured left leg (see  A Leg to Stand On). After experiencing alienation from his injured leg, as if it did not belong to him, he mentioned this sensation to his doctor who dismissed the notion out of hand. This angered Sacks who set about looking for case literature on the subject. He found nothing for three years. Then he came upon three works. The first was “an account by Silas Weir Mitchell, an American neurologist working at a Philadelphia hospital for amputees during the Civil War. He described, very fully and carefully, phantom limbs (or ‘sensory ghosts,’ as he called them) that amputees experienced in place of their lost limbs. He also wrote of ‘negative phantoms,’ the subjective annihilation and alienation of limbs following severe injury and surgery. He was so struck by these phenomena that he wrote a special circular on the matter, which was distributed by the surgeon general’s office in 1864.“Weir Mitchell’s observations aroused brief interest but then disappeared. More than fifty years passed before the syndrome was rediscovered as thousands of new cases of neurological trauma were treated during the First World War. In 1917, the French neurologist Joseph Babinski . . . published a monograph in which, apparently ignorant of Weir Mitchell’s report, he described the syndrome I had experienced with my own leg injury. Babinski’s observations, like Weir Mitchell’s, sank without a trace. (When, in 1975, I finally came upon Babinski’s book in our library, I found I was the first person to have borrowed it since 1918.) During the Second World War, the syndrome was fully described for a third time by two Soviet neurologists, Aleksei N. Leont’ev and Alexander Zaporozhets— again in ignorance of their predecessors. Yet though their book, Rehabilitation of Hand Function, was translated into English in 1960, their observations completely failed to enter the consciousness of either neurologists or rehabilitation specialists.“The work of Weir Mitchell and Babinski, of Leont’ev and Zaporozhets, seemed to have fallen into a historical or cultural scotoma, a ‘memory hole,’ as Orwell would say.“As I pieced together this extraordinary, even bizarre story, I felt more sympathy with my surgeon’s saying that he had never heard of anything like my symptoms before. The syndrome is not that uncommon: it occurs whenever there is a significant loss of proprioception and other sensory feedback through immobility or nerve damage. But why is it so difficult to put this on the record, to give the syndrome its due place in our neurological knowledge and consciousness?” (p. 196)The chapter “Mishearings” is probably the funniest thing Sacks has ever written—just hilarious this unquestionably informative application of his clinical sensibilities to his own failing hearing. “When Kate spoke of going to choir practice [actually a chiropractor], I accepted this: she could have been going to choir practice. But when a friend spoke one day about ‘a big-time cuttlefish diagnosed with ALS,’ I felt I must be mishearing. Cephalopods have elaborate nervous systems, it is true, and perhaps, I thought for a split second, a cuttlefish could have ALS. But the idea of a ‘big-time’ cuttlefish was ridiculous. (It turned out to be ‘a big-time publicist.’)” (p. 125)So three fascinating examples, one very detailed, of the essays included here. I recommend all of Dr. Sacks's book, including this one, unreservedly."
1,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Oliver Sacks was a neurologist and a great author. He wrote a number of memorable books about psychology, psychiatry and neurology. He is most famous for his books such as The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales and An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales. These books try to use very unusual minds and psychological conditions to understand better how the brain works. But it is not fair to focus on just these books; he was a Renaissance man, and he wrote a wide range of books and could converse intelligently on many many subjects.This book is not just about consciousness, per se. In fact, the book's title is a play on words; ""Stream of Consciousness"" may also be a good description, as each chapter is really an essay about a different topic. Each essay is wonderful and entertaining; a chapter about Darwin, Freud, Poincaré, Tourette's syndrome, color blindness, face blindness, and other interesting topics. Be warned though; some of this book is difficult; for me, the chapter about Freud was especially difficult.The most interesting aspect of the book is his focus on periods of darkness, which he called ""scotoma"". This term is used in multiple ways. First, an individual can have a black-out period in which memory or vision disappears. Then, there is a societal scientific scotoma, where a whole body of knowledge seems to disappear--sometimes for centuries--before reappearing at a later time. Tourette's syndrome is one of these scotoma's, because it was known during the 19th century, but disappeared from the scientific literature before being revived late in the 20th. Another one is the astronomical concept of the sun being the center of the solar system--known to the ancient Greeks, but Aristotle and Ptolemy changed this view to a geocentric universe, until Copernicus brought the correct theory back to science.This book is one of Sacks' last books--he may have still been writing it when he died in 2015. But, besides being short, the book feels like it was finished properly. I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook. Dan Woren does an excellent reading of the book, and if you are able to listen to nonfiction attentively, then I heartily recommend it."
2,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9573608-mason-neil,4,"I have found that as I've read books written later in Sacks' life, his tone shifts from a focus on specific details to a more abstract and comprehensive overview that delves more into the meanings of his life's observations. The River of Consciousness was, for me, an excellent culmination of that change in tone and focus. Sacks writes about all areas of science with such grace and art that you can't help but be completely consumed. There were moments in The River of Consciousness, especially towards the beginning, where I detected a change in tone or voice that may be indicative of the ghost writing involved in finishing this book, but the majority of the book and latter half especially filled me with enough awe and fascination that I would still consider this one of my favorite Sacks reads. I will miss his writing dearly and I am sure I will be revisiting his books often."
3,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33831018-paul-ataua,3," A fairly mixed bag of variable quality. Essays on Darwin, Time, Freud, and more. All were beautifully written and superficially interesting, but never really inspiring and rarely thought provoking. I read an essay, stopped momentarily, and then moved onto the next one. Yes, I did enjoy reading it, but I also sensed a lack of depth or coherence I didn’t associate with Sacks. "
4,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,4,"A short collection of previously published essays that make us feel the loss of a person like Oliver Sacks very keenly. He loved science and scientific advances in all fields, not just his chosen profession of neuroscience. The collection is a bit too eclectic to be was wonderful as something like The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat. The essays on Darwin aren’t that interesting but for the essays that focus more particularly on neuroscience and the brain, especially “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science,” his love and passion shine through."
5,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477073-jeff,3,"Not his most cohesive or engaging book, but still worth the read. "
6,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,4,"I like Oliver Sacks for how he describes the world and how he analyses every little fact. I love how he finds ""marvelous"" from defective beings: be that a man or a theory or a phenomena. However, I cannot reconcile with his interest in psychoanalysis, and specifically Freud. Though I gather that he liked his methods because Freud was more of descriptive kind of guy, Sacks forgets how Freud just ignores systematic findings, scientific methods and oppositional evidence. If you do that, you will end up with a guy that has beautiful imaginative mind with wonderful descriptions of psychosis and the being inside. However Freud was never ""that"". And using him to argue for considering opposition in science, is ridiculous to me.However, Oliver Sacks argument for a need of depth is completely valid to me. I just don't think that he was successful at giving a good solution to that problem. "
7,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"The River of Consciousness, the last book Oliver Sacks compiled before his death, is classic Oliver Sacks. He tells swimmingly-good stories, often eventually examining neurological phenomena, but weaving together widely-disparate data to tell his story. In his essay Speed, for example, Sacks talked about plant growth, photography, a horse's gallop, changes in time perception with age, the apparent compression and expansion of time under various conditions, myoclonic jerks, etc. He referred to William James, H. G. Wells, Karl Ernst von Baer, Hannah Arendt, and many others. You get the picture.Sacks loved to examine errors and kept lists of his own mishearings in his journal (he was very deaf and made many). His assistant confusingly talked about being off to ""choir practice"" – which he later learned was the chiropractor. When on another day she jokingly said she was off to choir practice, he heard ""firecrackers."" While Freud and many of the rest of us see such mistakes in pejorative ways, Sacks saw them as opportunities to understand general phenomena. Everything – everything – is grist for the mill. For example, If a mishearing seems plausible, one may not think one has misheard; it is only if the mishearing is sufficiently implausible, or entirely out of context, that one thinks, “This can’t be right,” and (perhaps with some embarrassment) asks the speaker to repeat himself"" (Loc. 1390-1392). And why, he asks, do we mishear words, but not music? Why do we mishear lyrics and not the notes?Sack's discussion of plagiarism is similarly interesting – and goes in a direction different than most of us would take it (I am currently grading papers and have a very different perspective). Brian Williams, for example, was suspended from NBC for six months for exaggerating his role in a helicopter episode in Iraq. Sacks, however, in talking about President Reagan telling a story that was ""an almost exact duplicate of a scene in the 1944 film A Wing and a Prayer"" concluded that ""Reagan had apparently retained the facts but forgotten their source (Loc. 1192-1195). Elizabeth Loftus would be happy with Sacks' analysis.Sacks continues his discussion of plagiarism: What would it be like if we remembered everything and its source? ""Confusion over sources or indifference to them can be a paradoxical strength: if we could tag the sources of all our knowledge, we would be overwhelmed with often irrelevant information. Indifference to source allows us to assimilate what we read, what we are told, what others say and think and write and paint, as intensely and richly as if they were primary experiences. It allows us to see and hear with other eyes and ears, to enter into other minds, to assimilate the art and science and religion of the whole culture, to enter into and contribute to the common mind, the general commonwealth of knowledge. Memory arises not only from experience but from the intercourse of many minds"" (Loc. 1353-1358). And this: ""What is at issue is not the fact of “borrowing” or “imitating,” of being “derivative,” being “influenced,” but what one does with what is borrowed or imitated or derived; how deeply one assimilates it, takes it into oneself, compounds it with one’s own experiences and thoughts and feelings, places it in relation to oneself, and expresses it in a new way, one’s own"" (Loc. 1565-1567).I have read perhaps five of Sacks' books and will likely read more as I run across them. The first of these – The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat – was one of a handful of books that shook my world and made me look at it differently.The world is a poorer place without Oliver Sacks (1933-2015)."
8,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61519-aerin,3,"This is a collection of essays on various topics that was compiled and published after Sacks' death. As such, there isn't much of an overarching theme across the pieces, and the ones I enjoyed mostly retold or reframed stories from his previous books - particularly  The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat,  An Anthropologist on Mars,  Musicophilia,  Hallucinations, and  A Leg To Stand On. If you haven't read those, I'd recommend them over this one. Still, Sacks was an incredibly thoughtful and wise writer, and I don't regret reading this at all."
9,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381357-tracey,4,This man has such a wonderful way of describing the ways of the Mind and body. 
10,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"A highly interesting, multifaceted essay collection. Sacks's magpie mind is well-represented here, a series of essays that discuss more than their subject matter without ever getting too arcane. Fascinating to read about Freud's evolution from neurology to psychotherapy, or the nature of visual consciousness, or to consider what Sacks calls ""Scotoma""—dark spots in the field of vision—in scientific knowledge. And underneath all of those explorations, a deep joy in the possibilities of creation, evolution, and art. Sacks says: 
There is no way by which the events of the world can be directly transmitted or recorded in our brains; they are experienced and constructed in a highly subjective way, which is different in every individual to begin with, and differently reinterpreted or reexperienced whenever they are recollected. Our only truth is narrative truth, the stories we tell each other and ourselves—the stories we continually recategorize and refine. Such subjectivity is built into the very nature of memory and follows from its basis and mechanisms in the brains we have.
I'll miss his thoughts in the world."

12,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35789244-paul,5,Oliver Sacks is the most approachable genius one could encounter while studying the human brain and its behaviors. This book is sublime.
13,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2044236-nyamka-ganni,3,I fear this was not his best. I still enjoyed it. He's like that annoying friend who knows everything and talks non-stop. You can't help but to listen to him talking and enjoy 😂.
14,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40940518-marcus-hobson,4,"This is yet another marvellous book to add the the shelf of other titles from the late Dr Oliver Sachs.The Forward tells of a television documentary called ""A Glorious Accident"" which gathered together a biologist, a physicist, a palaeontologist, a historian of science, a philosopher and Dr Sachs. What shone through was Sachs' ability to move fluidly between all of the disciplines represented. That is where this book sits, moving easily between sciences and the traits of the human brain. We consider the less know aspects of Darwin the botanist and Freud the neurologist, and finally we a fascinated by the idea of scotoma, from the Greek word meaning a darkness, or in many cases the loss of an idea which someone had put forward but no-one had picked up on or taken forwards. It is an idea the reoccurs throughout the ten pieces in this collection and it shows Sachs as a diligent historian of his scientific interests. Reading backwards it is possible to find great insights in the meticulous records made in the nineteenth century.In one piece, 'The Falability of Memory' Sachs talks about his own experiences of childhood memories being distorted. He had assimilated an often told story so that he too was present at the incident, when in facts his siblings reminded him that he was in fact not present at all. It is one of the tricks that memory plays.For me the chapter 'The Creative Self' was the most interesting, talking about mimicry, imitation and finally mimesis. Only humans will move to the third stage, adding a representational dimension where we re-enact or re-present what we have seen. He notes that ""All of us, to some extent, borrow from others, from the culture around us."" It is how deeply one assimilates what we have seen and heard with our own experiences in order to express things in a new way, that really matters. "
15,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2752385-jackie,5,Another fascinating study of human consciousness. Sacks describes sentience in lower order animals and in plants. He studies illnesses such as Tourettes and Parkinsons. He leads the reader on a journey of the history of scientific ideas and educates us through story telling. 
16,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783847-ginger-bensman,5,"10 essays--science, philosophy, pondering the depths and whys and whats of who we are and how we happen to be aware (and what exactly is awareness!), and all with such lucid humility and kindness. Now that I have discovered Oliver Sacks I'm on a mission to read everything he has ever written. "
17,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This is the final book written by Oliver Sacks and it was published after his August 2015 death by cancer. It was written as a catalyst from a documentary he was in which included 6 scientists in 1993. The issues investigated were the origin of life, the meaning of evolution and the nature of consciousness. All disciplines from all sciences were investigated. This book explored all sciences including Darwin and evolution, botany and psychology. Sacks had a familiarity with literature, medicine since he was a neurologist, botany, animal anatomy, chemistry, the history of science, philosophy and psychology. He worked until his death. This book reveals his ability to make connections in all the sciences and his true knowledge as a scientist and storyteller. Some of these articles, 10 in number, were fairly academic in tone and if not familiar with his prior books or some of these sciences would require definition. Since I love science and studied it, I found them fascinating. His first article dealt with “Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers” in which he discussed Darwin as a botanist and natural selection at work. He states that 70% DNA between humans to plants is unique. He especially loved Orchids. In the article “Speed”, he discusses movement from the wings of insects, the movement of plants and the slowness of the tortoise. He discussed time lapse photography to see movement change. A microscope shows slow motion and a telescope is the speeding up of motion. He discussed martial arts and speed and how drugs are either accelerators or retarders of speed. In “Sentience”, he wrote about the mental life of plants and worms, the light and day behavior of invertebrate minds. Other interesting articles dealt with “The Other Road”, Freud as a Neurologist and the “Fallibility of Memory”. This was about the errors of memory, the distortions, reality and subjective imagination and the use of Functional Brain Imaging. The “Mishearing” article, dealt with alterations in hearing and the perceptions of it that pose as reality. In the “Creative Self”, he discussed the inquisitive mind of a child and the importance of storytelling and mythmaking and the minds of savants and the autistic. How important education is for voracious assimilation of art, film, literature and immersion through reading. In a “General Feeling of Disorder” he discusses homeostasis in the body, the core consciousness of the body and migraines and his melanoma. In “River of Consciousness” he discusses how our motions and actions in time and thoughts flow like a river. They are ever flowing. In “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science”, he explores instances of scientific discoveries that were underappreciated or ignored in their time.In many of these articles Sacks mentions many of the books he wrote which were based on medical cases. I found this book to be a very fitting depiction of Oliver Sacks and his brilliant mind."
18,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Reading Oliver Sacks makes me glad to be alive. Sometimes I look at the title and know I am going to love whatever he's writing about, and of course I do. But I'll look at some essay and think, 'oh dear, this one is bound to be dull,' only to find that it is exactly the opposite -- it opens worlds of thought than I had no idea existed before. Sad to think this was his last book, but I've not read many of his earlier ones, so there's still plenty to look forward to!"
19,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"It’s always a pleasure to read something by Oliver Sacks, and this is no exception. A collection of essays rather than a book on one subject, it had much that was thought provoking."
20,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29125964-linda-petrini,0,"Oliver was an amazing writer, this book is the perfect mix between a review of the most interesting research on consciousness in the past couple centuries and anecdotes and examples coming from the author's experience as a neurologist."
21,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54912691-bianca,5,"Wow! What a book! It took me a long time to finish from the moment I bought it in some random airport on my way to or from my cruise ship, until now. A big part of this was due to my slow reading habits, which turned out to be just a skill I managed to improve over a short period of time, which lead to finishing this book within the last week. As a result I'd like to state that I don't consider this a light read, as it's so full of information and amazing references. I discovered Oliver Sacks randomly on YouTube in 'Ode to the brain' where there was a snippet of his TED talk in which he says 'We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well. And what we see with the brain is often called imagination.' This totally captivated me and I was delighted to find a book of his on a shelf at random; I didn't immediately recognize the name, but the portrait at the back cover I did immediately. Now I will surely never forget his name. On a sadder note, this book, although my first read of his, was his last writing up to 2015 when he passed away after a fight with metastatic liver cancer. This book was published 2 years after his death, in 2017 (or at least the version I have). The man had a vast mind and explored ideas and shared wanderings in a relatively old-fashioned and 'thick' way, that may not have an immediate appeal to readers of the 21st century. However the book has many wow moments for people who don't study these things academically, from talks of Darwin, to Newton, to Einstein, to consciousness, various other pioneers in their fields, and the very evolution of science, as well as the perception of the creative genius. The book explores a lot, therefore expect to have a lot to take in and ruminate over. Although I have literature through which I speed read, this is something I definitely wouldn't consider something to speed read through. I look forward to explore other books of his."
22,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14744407-matt-knepper,4,"Sacks has an ability to provide his readers a deeper understanding and new things to consider. This is a collection of essays on a range of topics that interested him. His knack for connecting ideas is on full display here. Each essay links to the previous one, showcasing some of the greatest leaps in human history. A true joy for anyone who appreciates his talents."

25,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63210457-zarina-marsaleh,4,"Oliver Sacks’s books normally consists of case studies but The River of Consciousness is a collection of essays of his thoughts on different topics of his interests - evolution, botany, chemistry, medicine, neuroscience and arts - and making connections between them and his own personal experiences.It is a pleasure to read references to literatures from the late 19th century that Sacks made. This is because he finds them tend to be much fuller, more vivid and much richer in description than modern ones - it was an era of naturalistic description and phenomenological passion for details. He mused whether it was a time when it was enough to simply describe them rather than the growing pressures of trying to explain scientific phenomena and this pressure subsequently made many previous literatures being neglected. Two essays in this book that I enjoyed most were Darwin & the Meaning of Flowers and The Creative Self. Though I may not entirely agree with the former, I learned that in reading it is as much as in life, that at times it is okay to agree to disagree."
26,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17181-jill,3,I don’t know how to give stars to this book. It’s obviously brilliant but I think my summer brain was not ready for the literary detail and I had to re-read many paragraphs to keep up conceptually. That said it’s fascinating and well worth reading. Mainly reflections on scientific research and development in a very impressive range of topics.
27,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20538306-sarah-flynn,4,"Like everything from Oliver Sacks, this is a brilliantly thought out, gently argued, brightly insightful book. It’s deep and dense, so it takes a while and some concentration. But the delightful variety of ideas, viewpoints, and insights keeps the book flowing. Brilliant, late-career, attentive musings on the nature of consciousness."

I'm glad I had a solid background in (armchair) neuroscience, evolution, and psychology because it really helped deepen my understanding of what Sacks discusses in this book. 3.5 stars."
29,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848870-tom,5,"Oliver Sacks once again provides an absorbing look at a wide range of subjects in nature and human behavior. He can seamlessly move between considerations of how aging, disease and drugs influence our perception of time, whether plants can be sentient, how our memories are reconstituted each time we bring them to consciousness, the relationship between mimicry and creativity, the biological basis of feeling ill, and the nature of consciousness. He also discusses the less known research of Darwin (on flowers) and Freud (in neurology). Sacks remarkable intelligence and clear writing are on full display.The final chapter-Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science- I found particularly pertinent. History in science, like history of any area of activity, is not the continuous sequence of events that are typically depicted in textbooks. There are starts and stops, blind alleys and forgotten insights. Sometimes there is what might be called premature closure of a line of inquiry when a dominant idea or, a dominant personality precludes other ways of constructing or interpreting observations. Dogmatic thinking takes hold and I think this is very common. Sacks describes how early observations of how some people with migraine experience the visual aura that precedes the headache was left fallow for decades as they didn’t fit the standard description. When we stop looking for anomalies, we cease to see them. Yet anomalies that challenge the orthodoxy are central to improving our understanding (cue Thomas Kuhn here). Early descriptions of what is now named Tourette’s were made in the late 19th century, but it wasn’t until the 1960s when haloperidol was found to subdue some of the effects of dopamine and many of the phenomena characteristic of Tourette’s that a biochemical explanation provided a reductive explanation. This was coherent with the predominantly reductive, materialism of the time with the result that “…the syndrome suddenly sprang into prominence again and indeed seemed to multiply its incidence a thousand-fold”(p192-3). This provides an interesting explanation for the, sometimes inexplicable, rise in prevalence of some diseases. A current example might be the attention given to concussive syndromes, which were barely recognized 20-30 years ago. Of course, the influence of improvements in diagnostic testing and case definitions on disease prevalence is well known, but what I find interesting is that when a set of clinical observations (symptoms and signs) are found to occur together, repeatedly, they define a syndrome and when a biological basis is ‘discovered’ that set becomes a disease and all other observations, particular to each patient, fall by the wayside. In this sense, disease labels are coherent with the predominate materialist reductionist worldview and appear to represent a paradigm as described by Thomas Kuhn.Unfortunately, “While we have moved from an era of pure description to one of active investigation and explanation, Tourette’s itself has been fragmented in the process and is no longer seen as a whole.” (p193) Case definitions of illness patterns that become accepted as ‘typical’ provide a basis for the abstractions we call diseases. Disease labels serve many purposes (clinical, administrative, social), but they also result in a narrowing of vision and loss of the particular features of each individual patient to be replaced by the general features, presumed to be shared by all who ‘have’ the same disease. “This sort of fragmentation is perhaps typical of a certain stage in science-the stage that follows pure description. But the fragments must somehow, sometime, be gathered together and presented once more as a coherent whole. This requires an understanding of determinants at every level, from the neurophysiological to the psychological, to the sociological -and of their continuous intricate interactions.” (p193) The footnote on the same page points out the way in which the rich descriptions of patients in psychiatric facilities in the 1920 and 30s have been replaced, in the era of the DSM, by simply naming the major and minor features that patients exhibit. “Present-day psychiatric charts in hospitals are almost completely devoid of the depth and density of information one finds in the older charts and will be of little use in helping us to bring about the synthesis of neuroscience with psychiatric knowledge we so need. The ‘old’ case histories and charts, however, will remain invaluable.” (fn4.p193-4) These passages remind me that Sack wrote the a very helpful Foreward to Kurt Goldstein’s book The Organism."
30,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,5,"This might be described as an Oliver Sacks primer. I’ve enjoyed it. Dr. Sacks was known for his fondness for the footnote, which is little in evidence here. So this might be a very good place to start for those new to his work. Moreover, it has a little taste of each of his books, among them: Migraine, A Leg to Stand On, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, An Anthropologist On Mars, The Island of the Colorblind, Hallucinations, and Awakenings, his fascinating magnum opus in which the footnotes sometimes rival the main text in length. Sacks’s hobby was botany, which makes his insights in the chapter “Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers” irresistible. On studying an orchid with a footlong nectary, Darwin predicted a moth with a matching proboscis would eventually be found which was that blossom’s particular pollinator. “More than 130 years after Darwin first suggested that a large moth pollinated an African orchid, his hypothesis was confirmed. It took quite some time, but quite clearly Darwin's prediction, based on extremely limited evidence but bolstered by his understanding of his own new theory of natural selection, was correct.” (The Guardian 2 Oct 2013.)The last chapter, “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science,” speaks to the absense of historical consciousness in science. This area is now starting to be addressed, but for most of the 20th century it was not. To tell the tale Sacks revisits the story of his own injured left leg (see  A Leg to Stand On). After experiencing alienation from his injured leg, as if it did not belong to him, he mentioned this sensation to his doctor who dismissed the notion out of hand. This angered Sacks who set about looking for case literature on the subject. He found nothing for three years. Then he came upon three works. The first was “an account by Silas Weir Mitchell, an American neurologist working at a Philadelphia hospital for amputees during the Civil War. He described, very fully and carefully, phantom limbs (or ‘sensory ghosts,’ as he called them) that amputees experienced in place of their lost limbs. He also wrote of ‘negative phantoms,’ the subjective annihilation and alienation of limbs following severe injury and surgery. He was so struck by these phenomena that he wrote a special circular on the matter, which was distributed by the surgeon general’s office in 1864.“Weir Mitchell’s observations aroused brief interest but then disappeared. More than fifty years passed before the syndrome was rediscovered as thousands of new cases of neurological trauma were treated during the First World War. In 1917, the French neurologist Joseph Babinski . . . published a monograph in which, apparently ignorant of Weir Mitchell’s report, he described the syndrome I had experienced with my own leg injury. Babinski’s observations, like Weir Mitchell’s, sank without a trace. (When, in 1975, I finally came upon Babinski’s book in our library, I found I was the first person to have borrowed it since 1918.) During the Second World War, the syndrome was fully described for a third time by two Soviet neurologists, Aleksei N. Leont’ev and Alexander Zaporozhets— again in ignorance of their predecessors. Yet though their book, Rehabilitation of Hand Function, was translated into English in 1960, their observations completely failed to enter the consciousness of either neurologists or rehabilitation specialists.“The work of Weir Mitchell and Babinski, of Leont’ev and Zaporozhets, seemed to have fallen into a historical or cultural scotoma, a ‘memory hole,’ as Orwell would say.“As I pieced together this extraordinary, even bizarre story, I felt more sympathy with my surgeon’s saying that he had never heard of anything like my symptoms before. The syndrome is not that uncommon: it occurs whenever there is a significant loss of proprioception and other sensory feedback through immobility or nerve damage. But why is it so difficult to put this on the record, to give the syndrome its due place in our neurological knowledge and consciousness?” (p. 196)The chapter “Mishearings” is probably the funniest thing Sacks has ever written—just hilarious this unquestionably informative application of his clinical sensibilities to his own failing hearing. “When Kate spoke of going to choir practice [actually a chiropractor], I accepted this: she could have been going to choir practice. But when a friend spoke one day about ‘a big-time cuttlefish diagnosed with ALS,’ I felt I must be mishearing. Cephalopods have elaborate nervous systems, it is true, and perhaps, I thought for a split second, a cuttlefish could have ALS. But the idea of a ‘big-time’ cuttlefish was ridiculous. (It turned out to be ‘a big-time publicist.’)” (p. 125)So three fascinating examples, one very detailed, of the essays included here. I recommend all of Dr. Sacks's book, including this one, unreservedly."
31,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Oliver Sacks was a neurologist and a great author. He wrote a number of memorable books about psychology, psychiatry and neurology. He is most famous for his books such as The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales and An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales. These books try to use very unusual minds and psychological conditions to understand better how the brain works. But it is not fair to focus on just these books; he was a Renaissance man, and he wrote a wide range of books and could converse intelligently on many many subjects.This book is not just about consciousness, per se. In fact, the book's title is a play on words; ""Stream of Consciousness"" may also be a good description, as each chapter is really an essay about a different topic. Each essay is wonderful and entertaining; a chapter about Darwin, Freud, Poincaré, Tourette's syndrome, color blindness, face blindness, and other interesting topics. Be warned though; some of this book is difficult; for me, the chapter about Freud was especially difficult.The most interesting aspect of the book is his focus on periods of darkness, which he called ""scotoma"". This term is used in multiple ways. First, an individual can have a black-out period in which memory or vision disappears. Then, there is a societal scientific scotoma, where a whole body of knowledge seems to disappear--sometimes for centuries--before reappearing at a later time. Tourette's syndrome is one of these scotoma's, because it was known during the 19th century, but disappeared from the scientific literature before being revived late in the 20th. Another one is the astronomical concept of the sun being the center of the solar system--known to the ancient Greeks, but Aristotle and Ptolemy changed this view to a geocentric universe, until Copernicus brought the correct theory back to science.This book is one of Sacks' last books--he may have still been writing it when he died in 2015. But, besides being short, the book feels like it was finished properly. I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook. Dan Woren does an excellent reading of the book, and if you are able to listen to nonfiction attentively, then I heartily recommend it."
32,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9573608-mason-neil,4,"I have found that as I've read books written later in Sacks' life, his tone shifts from a focus on specific details to a more abstract and comprehensive overview that delves more into the meanings of his life's observations. The River of Consciousness was, for me, an excellent culmination of that change in tone and focus. Sacks writes about all areas of science with such grace and art that you can't help but be completely consumed. There were moments in The River of Consciousness, especially towards the beginning, where I detected a change in tone or voice that may be indicative of the ghost writing involved in finishing this book, but the majority of the book and latter half especially filled me with enough awe and fascination that I would still consider this one of my favorite Sacks reads. I will miss his writing dearly and I am sure I will be revisiting his books often."
33,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33831018-paul-ataua,3," A fairly mixed bag of variable quality. Essays on Darwin, Time, Freud, and more. All were beautifully written and superficially interesting, but never really inspiring and rarely thought provoking. I read an essay, stopped momentarily, and then moved onto the next one. Yes, I did enjoy reading it, but I also sensed a lack of depth or coherence I didn’t associate with Sacks. "
34,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,4,"A short collection of previously published essays that make us feel the loss of a person like Oliver Sacks very keenly. He loved science and scientific advances in all fields, not just his chosen profession of neuroscience. The collection is a bit too eclectic to be was wonderful as something like The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat. The essays on Darwin aren’t that interesting but for the essays that focus more particularly on neuroscience and the brain, especially “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science,” his love and passion shine through."
35,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477073-jeff,3,"Not his most cohesive or engaging book, but still worth the read. "
36,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,4,"I like Oliver Sacks for how he describes the world and how he analyses every little fact. I love how he finds ""marvelous"" from defective beings: be that a man or a theory or a phenomena. However, I cannot reconcile with his interest in psychoanalysis, and specifically Freud. Though I gather that he liked his methods because Freud was more of descriptive kind of guy, Sacks forgets how Freud just ignores systematic findings, scientific methods and oppositional evidence. If you do that, you will end up with a guy that has beautiful imaginative mind with wonderful descriptions of psychosis and the being inside. However Freud was never ""that"". And using him to argue for considering opposition in science, is ridiculous to me.However, Oliver Sacks argument for a need of depth is completely valid to me. I just don't think that he was successful at giving a good solution to that problem. "
37,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"The River of Consciousness, the last book Oliver Sacks compiled before his death, is classic Oliver Sacks. He tells swimmingly-good stories, often eventually examining neurological phenomena, but weaving together widely-disparate data to tell his story. In his essay Speed, for example, Sacks talked about plant growth, photography, a horse's gallop, changes in time perception with age, the apparent compression and expansion of time under various conditions, myoclonic jerks, etc. He referred to William James, H. G. Wells, Karl Ernst von Baer, Hannah Arendt, and many others. You get the picture.Sacks loved to examine errors and kept lists of his own mishearings in his journal (he was very deaf and made many). His assistant confusingly talked about being off to ""choir practice"" – which he later learned was the chiropractor. When on another day she jokingly said she was off to choir practice, he heard ""firecrackers."" While Freud and many of the rest of us see such mistakes in pejorative ways, Sacks saw them as opportunities to understand general phenomena. Everything – everything – is grist for the mill. For example, If a mishearing seems plausible, one may not think one has misheard; it is only if the mishearing is sufficiently implausible, or entirely out of context, that one thinks, “This can’t be right,” and (perhaps with some embarrassment) asks the speaker to repeat himself"" (Loc. 1390-1392). And why, he asks, do we mishear words, but not music? Why do we mishear lyrics and not the notes?Sack's discussion of plagiarism is similarly interesting – and goes in a direction different than most of us would take it (I am currently grading papers and have a very different perspective). Brian Williams, for example, was suspended from NBC for six months for exaggerating his role in a helicopter episode in Iraq. Sacks, however, in talking about President Reagan telling a story that was ""an almost exact duplicate of a scene in the 1944 film A Wing and a Prayer"" concluded that ""Reagan had apparently retained the facts but forgotten their source (Loc. 1192-1195). Elizabeth Loftus would be happy with Sacks' analysis.Sacks continues his discussion of plagiarism: What would it be like if we remembered everything and its source? ""Confusion over sources or indifference to them can be a paradoxical strength: if we could tag the sources of all our knowledge, we would be overwhelmed with often irrelevant information. Indifference to source allows us to assimilate what we read, what we are told, what others say and think and write and paint, as intensely and richly as if they were primary experiences. It allows us to see and hear with other eyes and ears, to enter into other minds, to assimilate the art and science and religion of the whole culture, to enter into and contribute to the common mind, the general commonwealth of knowledge. Memory arises not only from experience but from the intercourse of many minds"" (Loc. 1353-1358). And this: ""What is at issue is not the fact of “borrowing” or “imitating,” of being “derivative,” being “influenced,” but what one does with what is borrowed or imitated or derived; how deeply one assimilates it, takes it into oneself, compounds it with one’s own experiences and thoughts and feelings, places it in relation to oneself, and expresses it in a new way, one’s own"" (Loc. 1565-1567).I have read perhaps five of Sacks' books and will likely read more as I run across them. The first of these – The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat – was one of a handful of books that shook my world and made me look at it differently.The world is a poorer place without Oliver Sacks (1933-2015)."
38,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61519-aerin,3,"This is a collection of essays on various topics that was compiled and published after Sacks' death. As such, there isn't much of an overarching theme across the pieces, and the ones I enjoyed mostly retold or reframed stories from his previous books - particularly  The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat,  An Anthropologist on Mars,  Musicophilia,  Hallucinations, and  A Leg To Stand On. If you haven't read those, I'd recommend them over this one. Still, Sacks was an incredibly thoughtful and wise writer, and I don't regret reading this at all."

40,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"A highly interesting, multifaceted essay collection. Sacks's magpie mind is well-represented here, a series of essays that discuss more than their subject matter without ever getting too arcane. Fascinating to read about Freud's evolution from neurology to psychotherapy, or the nature of visual consciousness, or to consider what Sacks calls ""Scotoma""—dark spots in the field of vision—in scientific knowledge. And underneath all of those explorations, a deep joy in the possibilities of creation, evolution, and art. Sacks says: 
There is no way by which the events of the world can be directly transmitted or recorded in our brains; they are experienced and constructed in a highly subjective way, which is different in every individual to begin with, and differently reinterpreted or reexperienced whenever they are recollected. Our only truth is narrative truth, the stories we tell each other and ourselves—the stories we continually recategorize and refine. Such subjectivity is built into the very nature of memory and follows from its basis and mechanisms in the brains we have.
I'll miss his thoughts in the world."

44,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40940518-marcus-hobson,4,"This is yet another marvellous book to add the the shelf of other titles from the late Dr Oliver Sachs.The Forward tells of a television documentary called ""A Glorious Accident"" which gathered together a biologist, a physicist, a palaeontologist, a historian of science, a philosopher and Dr Sachs. What shone through was Sachs' ability to move fluidly between all of the disciplines represented. That is where this book sits, moving easily between sciences and the traits of the human brain. We consider the less know aspects of Darwin the botanist and Freud the neurologist, and finally we a fascinated by the idea of scotoma, from the Greek word meaning a darkness, or in many cases the loss of an idea which someone had put forward but no-one had picked up on or taken forwards. It is an idea the reoccurs throughout the ten pieces in this collection and it shows Sachs as a diligent historian of his scientific interests. Reading backwards it is possible to find great insights in the meticulous records made in the nineteenth century.In one piece, 'The Falability of Memory' Sachs talks about his own experiences of childhood memories being distorted. He had assimilated an often told story so that he too was present at the incident, when in facts his siblings reminded him that he was in fact not present at all. It is one of the tricks that memory plays.For me the chapter 'The Creative Self' was the most interesting, talking about mimicry, imitation and finally mimesis. Only humans will move to the third stage, adding a representational dimension where we re-enact or re-present what we have seen. He notes that ""All of us, to some extent, borrow from others, from the culture around us."" It is how deeply one assimilates what we have seen and heard with our own experiences in order to express things in a new way, that really matters. "

47,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This is the final book written by Oliver Sacks and it was published after his August 2015 death by cancer. It was written as a catalyst from a documentary he was in which included 6 scientists in 1993. The issues investigated were the origin of life, the meaning of evolution and the nature of consciousness. All disciplines from all sciences were investigated. This book explored all sciences including Darwin and evolution, botany and psychology. Sacks had a familiarity with literature, medicine since he was a neurologist, botany, animal anatomy, chemistry, the history of science, philosophy and psychology. He worked until his death. This book reveals his ability to make connections in all the sciences and his true knowledge as a scientist and storyteller. Some of these articles, 10 in number, were fairly academic in tone and if not familiar with his prior books or some of these sciences would require definition. Since I love science and studied it, I found them fascinating. His first article dealt with “Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers” in which he discussed Darwin as a botanist and natural selection at work. He states that 70% DNA between humans to plants is unique. He especially loved Orchids. In the article “Speed”, he discusses movement from the wings of insects, the movement of plants and the slowness of the tortoise. He discussed time lapse photography to see movement change. A microscope shows slow motion and a telescope is the speeding up of motion. He discussed martial arts and speed and how drugs are either accelerators or retarders of speed. In “Sentience”, he wrote about the mental life of plants and worms, the light and day behavior of invertebrate minds. Other interesting articles dealt with “The Other Road”, Freud as a Neurologist and the “Fallibility of Memory”. This was about the errors of memory, the distortions, reality and subjective imagination and the use of Functional Brain Imaging. The “Mishearing” article, dealt with alterations in hearing and the perceptions of it that pose as reality. In the “Creative Self”, he discussed the inquisitive mind of a child and the importance of storytelling and mythmaking and the minds of savants and the autistic. How important education is for voracious assimilation of art, film, literature and immersion through reading. In a “General Feeling of Disorder” he discusses homeostasis in the body, the core consciousness of the body and migraines and his melanoma. In “River of Consciousness” he discusses how our motions and actions in time and thoughts flow like a river. They are ever flowing. In “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science”, he explores instances of scientific discoveries that were underappreciated or ignored in their time.In many of these articles Sacks mentions many of the books he wrote which were based on medical cases. I found this book to be a very fitting depiction of Oliver Sacks and his brilliant mind."
48,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Reading Oliver Sacks makes me glad to be alive. Sometimes I look at the title and know I am going to love whatever he's writing about, and of course I do. But I'll look at some essay and think, 'oh dear, this one is bound to be dull,' only to find that it is exactly the opposite -- it opens worlds of thought than I had no idea existed before. Sad to think this was his last book, but I've not read many of his earlier ones, so there's still plenty to look forward to!"
49,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"It’s always a pleasure to read something by Oliver Sacks, and this is no exception. A collection of essays rather than a book on one subject, it had much that was thought provoking."

51,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54912691-bianca,5,"Wow! What a book! It took me a long time to finish from the moment I bought it in some random airport on my way to or from my cruise ship, until now. A big part of this was due to my slow reading habits, which turned out to be just a skill I managed to improve over a short period of time, which lead to finishing this book within the last week. As a result I'd like to state that I don't consider this a light read, as it's so full of information and amazing references. I discovered Oliver Sacks randomly on YouTube in 'Ode to the brain' where there was a snippet of his TED talk in which he says 'We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well. And what we see with the brain is often called imagination.' This totally captivated me and I was delighted to find a book of his on a shelf at random; I didn't immediately recognize the name, but the portrait at the back cover I did immediately. Now I will surely never forget his name. On a sadder note, this book, although my first read of his, was his last writing up to 2015 when he passed away after a fight with metastatic liver cancer. This book was published 2 years after his death, in 2017 (or at least the version I have). The man had a vast mind and explored ideas and shared wanderings in a relatively old-fashioned and 'thick' way, that may not have an immediate appeal to readers of the 21st century. However the book has many wow moments for people who don't study these things academically, from talks of Darwin, to Newton, to Einstein, to consciousness, various other pioneers in their fields, and the very evolution of science, as well as the perception of the creative genius. The book explores a lot, therefore expect to have a lot to take in and ruminate over. Although I have literature through which I speed read, this is something I definitely wouldn't consider something to speed read through. I look forward to explore other books of his."

This is because he finds them tend to be much fuller, more vivid and much richer in description than modern ones - it was an era of naturalistic description and phenomenological passion for details. He mused whether it was a time when it was enough to simply describe them rather than the growing pressures of trying to explain scientific phenomena and this pressure subsequently made many previous literatures being neglected. Two essays in this book that I enjoyed most were Darwin & the Meaning of Flowers and The Creative Self. Though I may not entirely agree with the former, I learned that in reading it is as much as in life, that at times it is okay to agree to disagree."

59,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848870-tom,5,"Oliver Sacks once again provides an absorbing look at a wide range of subjects in nature and human behavior. He can seamlessly move between considerations of how aging, disease and drugs influence our perception of time, whether plants can be sentient, how our memories are reconstituted each time we bring them to consciousness, the relationship between mimicry and creativity, the biological basis of feeling ill, and the nature of consciousness. He also discusses the less known research of Darwin (on flowers) and Freud (in neurology). Sacks remarkable intelligence and clear writing are on full display.The final chapter-Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science- I found particularly pertinent. History in science, like history of any area of activity, is not the continuous sequence of events that are typically depicted in textbooks. There are starts and stops, blind alleys and forgotten insights. Sometimes there is what might be called premature closure of a line of inquiry when a dominant idea or, a dominant personality precludes other ways of constructing or interpreting observations. Dogmatic thinking takes hold and I think this is very common. Sacks describes how early observations of how some people with migraine experience the visual aura that precedes the headache was left fallow for decades as they didn’t fit the standard description. When we stop looking for anomalies, we cease to see them. Yet anomalies that challenge the orthodoxy are central to improving our understanding (cue Thomas Kuhn here). Early descriptions of what is now named Tourette’s were made in the late 19th century, but it wasn’t until the 1960s when haloperidol was found to subdue some of the effects of dopamine and many of the phenomena characteristic of Tourette’s that a biochemical explanation provided a reductive explanation. This was coherent with the predominantly reductive, materialism of the time with the result that “…the syndrome suddenly sprang into prominence again and indeed seemed to multiply its incidence a thousand-fold”(p192-3). This provides an interesting explanation for the, sometimes inexplicable, rise in prevalence of some diseases. A current example might be the attention given to concussive syndromes, which were barely recognized 20-30 years ago. Of course, the influence of improvements in diagnostic testing and case definitions on disease prevalence is well known, but what I find interesting is that when a set of clinical observations (symptoms and signs) are found to occur together, repeatedly, they define a syndrome and when a biological basis is ‘discovered’ that set becomes a disease and all other observations, particular to each patient, fall by the wayside. In this sense, disease labels are coherent with the predominate materialist reductionist worldview and appear to represent a paradigm as described by Thomas Kuhn.Unfortunately, “While we have moved from an era of pure description to one of active investigation and explanation, Tourette’s itself has been fragmented in the process and is no longer seen as a whole.” (p193) Case definitions of illness patterns that become accepted as ‘typical’ provide a basis for the abstractions we call diseases. Disease labels serve many purposes (clinical, administrative, social), but they also result in a narrowing of vision and loss of the particular features of each individual patient to be replaced by the general features, presumed to be shared by all who ‘have’ the same disease. “This sort of fragmentation is perhaps typical of a certain stage in science-the stage that follows pure description. But the fragments must somehow, sometime, be gathered together and presented once more as a coherent whole. This requires an understanding of determinants at every level, from the neurophysiological to the psychological, to the sociological -and of their continuous intricate interactions.” (p193) The footnote on the same page points out the way in which the rich descriptions of patients in psychiatric facilities in the 1920 and 30s have been replaced, in the era of the DSM, by simply naming the major and minor features that patients exhibit. “Present-day psychiatric charts in hospitals are almost completely devoid of the depth and density of information one finds in the older charts and will be of little use in helping us to bring about the synthesis of neuroscience with psychiatric knowledge we so need. The ‘old’ case histories and charts, however, will remain invaluable.” (fn4.p193-4) These passages remind me that Sack wrote the a very helpful Foreward to Kurt Goldstein’s book The Organism."
60,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,5,"This might be described as an Oliver Sacks primer. I’ve enjoyed it. Dr. Sacks was known for his fondness for the footnote, which is little in evidence here. So this might be a very good place to start for those new to his work. Moreover, it has a little taste of each of his books, among them: Migraine, A Leg to Stand On, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, An Anthropologist On Mars, The Island of the Colorblind, Hallucinations, and Awakenings, his fascinating magnum opus in which the footnotes sometimes rival the main text in length. Sacks’s hobby was botany, which makes his insights in the chapter “Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers” irresistible. On studying an orchid with a footlong nectary, Darwin predicted a moth with a matching proboscis would eventually be found which was that blossom’s particular pollinator. “More than 130 years after Darwin first suggested that a large moth pollinated an African orchid, his hypothesis was confirmed. It took quite some time, but quite clearly Darwin's prediction, based on extremely limited evidence but bolstered by his understanding of his own new theory of natural selection, was correct.” (The Guardian 2 Oct 2013.)The last chapter, “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science,” speaks to the absense of historical consciousness in science. This area is now starting to be addressed, but for most of the 20th century it was not. To tell the tale Sacks revisits the story of his own injured left leg (see  A Leg to Stand On). After experiencing alienation from his injured leg, as if it did not belong to him, he mentioned this sensation to his doctor who dismissed the notion out of hand. This angered Sacks who set about looking for case literature on the subject. He found nothing for three years. Then he came upon three works. The first was “an account by Silas Weir Mitchell, an American neurologist working at a Philadelphia hospital for amputees during the Civil War. He described, very fully and carefully, phantom limbs (or ‘sensory ghosts,’ as he called them) that amputees experienced in place of their lost limbs. He also wrote of ‘negative phantoms,’ the subjective annihilation and alienation of limbs following severe injury and surgery. He was so struck by these phenomena that he wrote a special circular on the matter, which was distributed by the surgeon general’s office in 1864.“Weir Mitchell’s observations aroused brief interest but then disappeared. More than fifty years passed before the syndrome was rediscovered as thousands of new cases of neurological trauma were treated during the First World War. In 1917, the French neurologist Joseph Babinski . . . published a monograph in which, apparently ignorant of Weir Mitchell’s report, he described the syndrome I had experienced with my own leg injury. Babinski’s observations, like Weir Mitchell’s, sank without a trace. (When, in 1975, I finally came upon Babinski’s book in our library, I found I was the first person to have borrowed it since 1918.) During the Second World War, the syndrome was fully described for a third time by two Soviet neurologists, Aleksei N. Leont’ev and Alexander Zaporozhets— again in ignorance of their predecessors. Yet though their book, Rehabilitation of Hand Function, was translated into English in 1960, their observations completely failed to enter the consciousness of either neurologists or rehabilitation specialists.“The work of Weir Mitchell and Babinski, of Leont’ev and Zaporozhets, seemed to have fallen into a historical or cultural scotoma, a ‘memory hole,’ as Orwell would say.“As I pieced together this extraordinary, even bizarre story, I felt more sympathy with my surgeon’s saying that he had never heard of anything like my symptoms before. The syndrome is not that uncommon: it occurs whenever there is a significant loss of proprioception and other sensory feedback through immobility or nerve damage. But why is it so difficult to put this on the record, to give the syndrome its due place in our neurological knowledge and consciousness?” (p. 196)The chapter “Mishearings” is probably the funniest thing Sacks has ever written—just hilarious this unquestionably informative application of his clinical sensibilities to his own failing hearing. “When Kate spoke of going to choir practice [actually a chiropractor], I accepted this: she could have been going to choir practice. But when a friend spoke one day about ‘a big-time cuttlefish diagnosed with ALS,’ I felt I must be mishearing. Cephalopods have elaborate nervous systems, it is true, and perhaps, I thought for a split second, a cuttlefish could have ALS. But the idea of a ‘big-time’ cuttlefish was ridiculous. (It turned out to be ‘a big-time publicist.’)” (p. 125)So three fascinating examples, one very detailed, of the essays included here. I recommend all of Dr. Sacks's book, including this one, unreservedly."
61,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Oliver Sacks was a neurologist and a great author. He wrote a number of memorable books about psychology, psychiatry and neurology. He is most famous for his books such as The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales and An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales. These books try to use very unusual minds and psychological conditions to understand better how the brain works. But it is not fair to focus on just these books; he was a Renaissance man, and he wrote a wide range of books and could converse intelligently on many many subjects.This book is not just about consciousness, per se. In fact, the book's title is a play on words; ""Stream of Consciousness"" may also be a good description, as each chapter is really an essay about a different topic. Each essay is wonderful and entertaining; a chapter about Darwin, Freud, Poincaré, Tourette's syndrome, color blindness, face blindness, and other interesting topics. Be warned though; some of this book is difficult; for me, the chapter about Freud was especially difficult.The most interesting aspect of the book is his focus on periods of darkness, which he called ""scotoma"". This term is used in multiple ways. First, an individual can have a black-out period in which memory or vision disappears. Then, there is a societal scientific scotoma, where a whole body of knowledge seems to disappear--sometimes for centuries--before reappearing at a later time. Tourette's syndrome is one of these scotoma's, because it was known during the 19th century, but disappeared from the scientific literature before being revived late in the 20th. Another one is the astronomical concept of the sun being the center of the solar system--known to the ancient Greeks, but Aristotle and Ptolemy changed this view to a geocentric universe, until Copernicus brought the correct theory back to science.This book is one of Sacks' last books--he may have still been writing it when he died in 2015. But, besides being short, the book feels like it was finished properly. I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook. Dan Woren does an excellent reading of the book, and if you are able to listen to nonfiction attentively, then I heartily recommend it."
62,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9573608-mason-neil,4,"I have found that as I've read books written later in Sacks' life, his tone shifts from a focus on specific details to a more abstract and comprehensive overview that delves more into the meanings of his life's observations. The River of Consciousness was, for me, an excellent culmination of that change in tone and focus. Sacks writes about all areas of science with such grace and art that you can't help but be completely consumed. There were moments in The River of Consciousness, especially towards the beginning, where I detected a change in tone or voice that may be indicative of the ghost writing involved in finishing this book, but the majority of the book and latter half especially filled me with enough awe and fascination that I would still consider this one of my favorite Sacks reads. I will miss his writing dearly and I am sure I will be revisiting his books often."
63,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33831018-paul-ataua,3," A fairly mixed bag of variable quality. Essays on Darwin, Time, Freud, and more. All were beautifully written and superficially interesting, but never really inspiring and rarely thought provoking. I read an essay, stopped momentarily, and then moved onto the next one. Yes, I did enjoy reading it, but I also sensed a lack of depth or coherence I didn’t associate with Sacks. "
64,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,4,"A short collection of previously published essays that make us feel the loss of a person like Oliver Sacks very keenly. He loved science and scientific advances in all fields, not just his chosen profession of neuroscience. The collection is a bit too eclectic to be was wonderful as something like The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat. The essays on Darwin aren’t that interesting but for the essays that focus more particularly on neuroscience and the brain, especially “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science,” his love and passion shine through."
65,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477073-jeff,3,"Not his most cohesive or engaging book, but still worth the read. "
66,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,4,"I like Oliver Sacks for how he describes the world and how he analyses every little fact. I love how he finds ""marvelous"" from defective beings: be that a man or a theory or a phenomena. However, I cannot reconcile with his interest in psychoanalysis, and specifically Freud. Though I gather that he liked his methods because Freud was more of descriptive kind of guy, Sacks forgets how Freud just ignores systematic findings, scientific methods and oppositional evidence. If you do that, you will end up with a guy that has beautiful imaginative mind with wonderful descriptions of psychosis and the being inside. However Freud was never ""that"". And using him to argue for considering opposition in science, is ridiculous to me.However, Oliver Sacks argument for a need of depth is completely valid to me. I just don't think that he was successful at giving a good solution to that problem. "
67,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"The River of Consciousness, the last book Oliver Sacks compiled before his death, is classic Oliver Sacks. He tells swimmingly-good stories, often eventually examining neurological phenomena, but weaving together widely-disparate data to tell his story. In his essay Speed, for example, Sacks talked about plant growth, photography, a horse's gallop, changes in time perception with age, the apparent compression and expansion of time under various conditions, myoclonic jerks, etc. He referred to William James, H. G. Wells, Karl Ernst von Baer, Hannah Arendt, and many others. You get the picture.Sacks loved to examine errors and kept lists of his own mishearings in his journal (he was very deaf and made many). His assistant confusingly talked about being off to ""choir practice"" – which he later learned was the chiropractor. When on another day she jokingly said she was off to choir practice, he heard ""firecrackers."" While Freud and many of the rest of us see such mistakes in pejorative ways, Sacks saw them as opportunities to understand general phenomena. Everything – everything – is grist for the mill. For example, If a mishearing seems plausible, one may not think one has misheard; it is only if the mishearing is sufficiently implausible, or entirely out of context, that one thinks, “This can’t be right,” and (perhaps with some embarrassment) asks the speaker to repeat himself"" (Loc. 1390-1392). And why, he asks, do we mishear words, but not music? Why do we mishear lyrics and not the notes?Sack's discussion of plagiarism is similarly interesting – and goes in a direction different than most of us would take it (I am currently grading papers and have a very different perspective). Brian Williams, for example, was suspended from NBC for six months for exaggerating his role in a helicopter episode in Iraq. Sacks, however, in talking about President Reagan telling a story that was ""an almost exact duplicate of a scene in the 1944 film A Wing and a Prayer"" concluded that ""Reagan had apparently retained the facts but forgotten their source (Loc. 1192-1195). Elizabeth Loftus would be happy with Sacks' analysis.Sacks continues his discussion of plagiarism: What would it be like if we remembered everything and its source? ""Confusion over sources or indifference to them can be a paradoxical strength: if we could tag the sources of all our knowledge, we would be overwhelmed with often irrelevant information. Indifference to source allows us to assimilate what we read, what we are told, what others say and think and write and paint, as intensely and richly as if they were primary experiences. It allows us to see and hear with other eyes and ears, to enter into other minds, to assimilate the art and science and religion of the whole culture, to enter into and contribute to the common mind, the general commonwealth of knowledge. Memory arises not only from experience but from the intercourse of many minds"" (Loc. 1353-1358). And this: ""What is at issue is not the fact of “borrowing” or “imitating,” of being “derivative,” being “influenced,” but what one does with what is borrowed or imitated or derived; how deeply one assimilates it, takes it into oneself, compounds it with one’s own experiences and thoughts and feelings, places it in relation to oneself, and expresses it in a new way, one’s own"" (Loc. 1565-1567).I have read perhaps five of Sacks' books and will likely read more as I run across them. The first of these – The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat – was one of a handful of books that shook my world and made me look at it differently.The world is a poorer place without Oliver Sacks (1933-2015)."
68,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61519-aerin,3,"This is a collection of essays on various topics that was compiled and published after Sacks' death. As such, there isn't much of an overarching theme across the pieces, and the ones I enjoyed mostly retold or reframed stories from his previous books - particularly  The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat,  An Anthropologist on Mars,  Musicophilia,  Hallucinations, and  A Leg To Stand On. If you haven't read those, I'd recommend them over this one. Still, Sacks was an incredibly thoughtful and wise writer, and I don't regret reading this at all."

Sacks's magpie mind is well-represented here, a series of essays that discuss more than their subject matter without ever getting too arcane. Fascinating to read about Freud's evolution from neurology to psychotherapy, or the nature of visual consciousness, or to consider what Sacks calls ""Scotoma""—dark spots in the field of vision—in scientific knowledge. And underneath all of those explorations, a deep joy in the possibilities of creation, evolution, and art. Sacks says: 
There is no way by which the events of the world can be directly transmitted or recorded in our brains; they are experienced and constructed in a highly subjective way, which is different in every individual to begin with, and differently reinterpreted or reexperienced whenever they are recollected. Our only truth is narrative truth, the stories we tell each other and ourselves—the stories we continually recategorize and refine. Such subjectivity is built into the very nature of memory and follows from its basis and mechanisms in the brains we have.
I'll miss his thoughts in the world."

74,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40940518-marcus-hobson,4,"This is yet another marvellous book to add the the shelf of other titles from the late Dr Oliver Sachs.The Forward tells of a television documentary called ""A Glorious Accident"" which gathered together a biologist, a physicist, a palaeontologist, a historian of science, a philosopher and Dr Sachs. What shone through was Sachs' ability to move fluidly between all of the disciplines represented. That is where this book sits, moving easily between sciences and the traits of the human brain. We consider the less know aspects of Darwin the botanist and Freud the neurologist, and finally we a fascinated by the idea of scotoma, from the Greek word meaning a darkness, or in many cases the loss of an idea which someone had put forward but no-one had picked up on or taken forwards. It is an idea the reoccurs throughout the ten pieces in this collection and it shows Sachs as a diligent historian of his scientific interests. Reading backwards it is possible to find great insights in the meticulous records made in the nineteenth century.In one piece, 'The Falability of Memory' Sachs talks about his own experiences of childhood memories being distorted. He had assimilated an often told story so that he too was present at the incident, when in facts his siblings reminded him that he was in fact not present at all. It is one of the tricks that memory plays.For me the chapter 'The Creative Self' was the most interesting, talking about mimicry, imitation and finally mimesis. Only humans will move to the third stage, adding a representational dimension where we re-enact or re-present what we have seen. He notes that ""All of us, to some extent, borrow from others, from the culture around us."" It is how deeply one assimilates what we have seen and heard with our own experiences in order to express things in a new way, that really matters. "

77,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This is the final book written by Oliver Sacks and it was published after his August 2015 death by cancer. It was written as a catalyst from a documentary he was in which included 6 scientists in 1993. The issues investigated were the origin of life, the meaning of evolution and the nature of consciousness. All disciplines from all sciences were investigated. This book explored all sciences including Darwin and evolution, botany and psychology. Sacks had a familiarity with literature, medicine since he was a neurologist, botany, animal anatomy, chemistry, the history of science, philosophy and psychology. He worked until his death. This book reveals his ability to make connections in all the sciences and his true knowledge as a scientist and storyteller. Some of these articles, 10 in number, were fairly academic in tone and if not familiar with his prior books or some of these sciences would require definition. Since I love science and studied it, I found them fascinating. His first article dealt with “Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers” in which he discussed Darwin as a botanist and natural selection at work. He states that 70% DNA between humans to plants is unique. He especially loved Orchids. In the article “Speed”, he discusses movement from the wings of insects, the movement of plants and the slowness of the tortoise. He discussed time lapse photography to see movement change. A microscope shows slow motion and a telescope is the speeding up of motion. He discussed martial arts and speed and how drugs are either accelerators or retarders of speed. In “Sentience”, he wrote about the mental life of plants and worms, the light and day behavior of invertebrate minds. Other interesting articles dealt with “The Other Road”, Freud as a Neurologist and the “Fallibility of Memory”. This was about the errors of memory, the distortions, reality and subjective imagination and the use of Functional Brain Imaging. The “Mishearing” article, dealt with alterations in hearing and the perceptions of it that pose as reality. In the “Creative Self”, he discussed the inquisitive mind of a child and the importance of storytelling and mythmaking and the minds of savants and the autistic. How important education is for voracious assimilation of art, film, literature and immersion through reading. In a “General Feeling of Disorder” he discusses homeostasis in the body, the core consciousness of the body and migraines and his melanoma. In “River of Consciousness” he discusses how our motions and actions in time and thoughts flow like a river. They are ever flowing. In “Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science”, he explores instances of scientific discoveries that were underappreciated or ignored in their time.In many of these articles Sacks mentions many of the books he wrote which were based on medical cases. I found this book to be a very fitting depiction of Oliver Sacks and his brilliant mind."
78,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Reading Oliver Sacks makes me glad to be alive. Sometimes I look at the title and know I am going to love whatever he's writing about, and of course I do. But I'll look at some essay and think, 'oh dear, this one is bound to be dull,' only to find that it is exactly the opposite -- it opens worlds of thought than I had no idea existed before. Sad to think this was his last book, but I've not read many of his earlier ones, so there's still plenty to look forward to!"

81,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54912691-bianca,5,"Wow! What a book! It took me a long time to finish from the moment I bought it in some random airport on my way to or from my cruise ship, until now. A big part of this was due to my slow reading habits, which turned out to be just a skill I managed to improve over a short period of time, which lead to finishing this book within the last week. As a result I'd like to state that I don't consider this a light read, as it's so full of information and amazing references. I discovered Oliver Sacks randomly on YouTube in 'Ode to the brain' where there was a snippet of his TED talk in which he says 'We see with the eyes, but we see with the brain as well. And what we see with the brain is often called imagination.' This totally captivated me and I was delighted to find a book of his on a shelf at random; I didn't immediately recognize the name, but the portrait at the back cover I did immediately. Now I will surely never forget his name. On a sadder note, this book, although my first read of his, was his last writing up to 2015 when he passed away after a fight with metastatic liver cancer. This book was published 2 years after his death, in 2017 (or at least the version I have). The man had a vast mind and explored ideas and shared wanderings in a relatively old-fashioned and 'thick' way, that may not have an immediate appeal to readers of the 21st century. However the book has many wow moments for people who don't study these things academically, from talks of Darwin, to Newton, to Einstein, to consciousness, various other pioneers in their fields, and the very evolution of science, as well as the perception of the creative genius. The book explores a lot, therefore expect to have a lot to take in and ruminate over. Although I have literature through which I speed read, this is something I definitely wouldn't consider something to speed read through. I look forward to explore other books of his."

This is because he finds them tend to be much fuller, more vivid and much richer in description than modern ones - it was an era of naturalistic description and phenomenological passion for details. He mused whether it was a time when it was enough to simply describe them rather than the growing pressures of trying to explain scientific phenomena and this pressure subsequently made many previous literatures being neglected. Two essays in this book that I enjoyed most were Darwin & the Meaning of Flowers and The Creative Self. Though I may not entirely agree with the former, I learned that in reading it is as much as in life, that at times it is okay to agree to disagree."

89,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848870-tom,5,"Oliver Sacks once again provides an absorbing look at a wide range of subjects in nature and human behavior. He can seamlessly move between considerations of how aging, disease and drugs influence our perception of time, whether plants can be sentient, how our memories are reconstituted each time we bring them to consciousness, the relationship between mimicry and creativity, the biological basis of feeling ill, and the nature of consciousness. He also discusses the less known research of Darwin (on flowers) and Freud (in neurology). Sacks remarkable intelligence and clear writing are on full display.The final chapter-Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science- I found particularly pertinent. History in science, like history of any area of activity, is not the continuous sequence of events that are typically depicted in textbooks. There are starts and stops, blind alleys and forgotten insights. Sometimes there is what might be called premature closure of a line of inquiry when a dominant idea or, a dominant personality precludes other ways of constructing or interpreting observations. Dogmatic thinking takes hold and I think this is very common. Sacks describes how early observations of how some people with migraine experience the visual aura that precedes the headache was left fallow for decades as they didn’t fit the standard description. When we stop looking for anomalies, we cease to see them. Yet anomalies that challenge the orthodoxy are central to improving our understanding (cue Thomas Kuhn here). Early descriptions of what is now named Tourette’s were made in the late 19th century, but it wasn’t until the 1960s when haloperidol was found to subdue some of the effects of dopamine and many of the phenomena characteristic of Tourette’s that a biochemical explanation provided a reductive explanation. This was coherent with the predominantly reductive, materialism of the time with the result that “…the syndrome suddenly sprang into prominence again and indeed seemed to multiply its incidence a thousand-fold”(p192-3). This provides an interesting explanation for the, sometimes inexplicable, rise in prevalence of some diseases. A current example might be the attention given to concussive syndromes, which were barely recognized 20-30 years ago. Of course, the influence of improvements in diagnostic testing and case definitions on disease prevalence is well known, but what I find interesting is that when a set of clinical observations (symptoms and signs) are found to occur together, repeatedly, they define a syndrome and when a biological basis is ‘discovered’ that set becomes a disease and all other observations, particular to each patient, fall by the wayside. In this sense, disease labels are coherent with the predominate materialist reductionist worldview and appear to represent a paradigm as described by Thomas Kuhn.Unfortunately, “While we have moved from an era of pure description to one of active investigation and explanation, Tourette’s itself has been fragmented in the process and is no longer seen as a whole.” (p193) Case definitions of illness patterns that become accepted as ‘typical’ provide a basis for the abstractions we call diseases. Disease labels serve many purposes (clinical, administrative, social), but they also result in a narrowing of vision and loss of the particular features of each individual patient to be replaced by the general features, presumed to be shared by all who ‘have’ the same disease. “This sort of fragmentation is perhaps typical of a certain stage in science-the stage that follows pure description. But the fragments must somehow, sometime, be gathered together and presented once more as a coherent whole. This requires an understanding of determinants at every level, from the neurophysiological to the psychological, to the sociological -and of their continuous intricate interactions.” (p193) The footnote on the same page points out the way in which the rich descriptions of patients in psychiatric facilities in the 1920 and 30s have been replaced, in the era of the DSM, by simply naming the major and minor features that patients exhibit. “Present-day psychiatric charts in hospitals are almost completely devoid of the depth and density of information one finds in the older charts and will be of little use in helping us to bring about the synthesis of neuroscience with psychiatric knowledge we so need. The ‘old’ case histories and charts, however, will remain invaluable.” (fn4.p193-4) These passages remind me that Sack wrote the a very helpful Foreward to Kurt Goldstein’s book The Organism."
90,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,5,"Oliver Sacks remains, even post-mortem, one of the most brilliant essayists and thinkers writing in English. The River of Consciousness is a volume of pieces published in the New York Review of Books and selected by Sacks for inclusion here only a few days before his death. His editorial team and designees have done a wonderful job arranging these meditations on speed, consciousness, the intricacies of the brain, Darwin, and the sentience of plants.Each piece has a thematic unity that is enriched by Sacks astounding ability to digress and yet hold the thread of thought firmly between his fingers. And each piece is stylistically a marvel of lucidity, pace, and one, sometimes drawing scientific history, sometimes drawing on Sacks' personal experiences as a doctor and thinker, and sometimes drawing on his capacity as an intellectual historian.For me his most useful observations have to do with the changing nature of science itself from the 19th century through the 20th. Fundamentally the science of the 19th century was rooted in detail, the accumulation of annotations relevant to a given subject. A hinge figure was Darwin, who both recorded every little thing he saw and at the same time felt the pressure to consolidate his findings into theoretical form--ergo, evolution. Theory can never be detached from ""fact"" and yet Einstein took us into a paradigm-shift based on an entirely different theory of time and space. Freud is less well known as a neurologist than as a psychoanalyst, but as Sacks (and others) observe, Freud's first twenty years as a doctor were heavily invested in neurological data collection. Sacks then comments on how Freud's experience in natural science blended rather naturally into his psychologizing in broader terms. He mentions the famous case of Anna O--a case of hysteria, demonstrating weird somatic effects emerging from even weirder psychodynamics--and this caused me last night to reread that case in light of Sack's analysis. In fact, it's true that one can see Freud driven from nonplussed doctoring to psychodynamic theorizing for compelling reasons. And with Anna O, the history of psychology, as we know it, was changed.But writing in the 21st century Sacks has moved far beyond those early days of mental mystery, giving us glimpses of the multi-tiered neuronal complexity that underlies sight, thought, memory and identity.I understand one more book of this nature is in the offing. May Sacks continue speaking from the grave even longer than that."
91,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2395941-nicole,4,"When I first saw this book on the new releases table at the book store, I was skeptical. Is the estate of Oliver Sacks simply trying to milk all they can from a great mind now departed, I wondered. How can a book published from scraps be any good? I decided against getting it as a Christmas present for someone because of this, but when I saw it at the library, available thanks to a program here in Seattle to keep new releases in stock, I couldn't help but to check it out. I'm glad I did. From the observations made during the vivisection of jellyfish to how people with various neurological afflictions perceive time, the essays of ""The River of Consciousness"" are all united by the larger theme of scientific discovery. Sacks' indefatigable intellectual curiosity and love of his subjects carries through from beyond the grave, and gives this book a lightness and readability. I enjoyed the subtle encouragement I felt reading it to explore and observe not only nature, but the workings of my own mind as a part of it. Sadly, Sacks died before he could neatly tie it all together, but the ideas carried in each essay richly fold into each other, emerging as an appreciative history of the human understanding of the natural world. "
92,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,4,"Nice collection of essays. I recently read Uncle Tungsten, one of Sachs's older books. Like that one, this has a number of essays on the history of various scientific disciplines and theories. I am not all that interested in that subject (and much prefer his books about cases in neurology), but Sachs's enthusiasm is contagious. The title essay is the next to last in the book. From its name, I thought it would pull the book together with some kind of statement about how consciousness works, but it was about how we perceive time, which was also interesting. The last essay did somehow pull the book together. It was about scotoma, which is literal blind spots, but he uses the term figuratively for how things in various scientific disciplines (theories, diseases, symptoms, etc.) that turn out to be correct have been ignored, sometimes for centuries, until someone remembers them or reinvents them - or until mainstream thinking has caught up with them. Very interesting."
93,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13417219-emily,3,"3.5 stars. I listened to the audio version of this book of essays. Oliver Sacks was a genius, to be sure, but some of these essays, written shortly before his death at 81, focused on scientific genres that were not of huge interest to me (even chemistry came into play!) I did enjoy the parts that focused on neurology, psychology, and medicine. I have always remembered the movie ""Awakenings"", which is based on his book of the same name, but this is the first of his books I have actually read (or, well, listened to). I have another on hold at my library that I expect will be more up my alley, Hallucinations. This was interesting for the most part, but I found my mind wandering through some of it."
94,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey,5,"Oliver Sacks was a treasure, both to his patients as a neurologist and to the broader public as a writer. He completed the outline for this book just weeks before his death in 2015. It brings together a wide range of his essays. I especially liked ""The Fallibility of Memory,"" ""The Creative Self,"" and ""The River of Consciousness,"" because they are philosophical in nature and touch on topics that interest me deeply. How could a writer like myself not be drawn to an essay that contains the sentence ""Our only truth is narrative truth, the stories we tell each other and ourselves--the stories we continually recategorize and refine.""? But I also enjoyed learning more about Darwin, botany, and a whole other side of Freud. "
95,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3847310-bob,5,"Magnificent and magical. Sacks' ability to convey medical and scientific information to lay people was always among the best, and this series of essays is a source of both enlightenment and intrigue. I recommend his piece on the fallibility of memory to everyone, young and old - for me, it explains why I have such vivid memories of events from my childhood that my sister and our old friends assure me did not occur (as well as verifying my understanding of the fallibility of eyewitness identifications, and the notion that everyone sees, filters and interprets the world/events through his/her own lifetime of prior experiences). Other chapters, particularly those on the illusions of time, and the essence of consciousness (in animals and plants both), similarly explain and challenge our notions of life and the universe. Only 217 pages - but loaded!"
96,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88960681-justin-clark,5,"The River of Consciousness by Oliver Sacks is a remarkable journey through all the varied interests and passions of the late psychologist. His love for science, especially his heroes Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, and William James, permeate every page. In regards to Freud, my favorite chapter was the one in which Sacks delves into the psychoanalyst’s time as an anatomical neurologist and its influence on his work. The eponymous chapter is also excellent, wherein Sacks follows the lead of William James and argues that consciousness isn’t an object but a process, which is in flux our entire lives. Both poetic and scholarly, this book leaves the reader with both a thirst for knowledge and a sense of wonder."
97,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/881968-jason,5,"Another, and sadly the last, addition to Dr. Sack's completely unique and beguiling library of brilliance.

106,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278477-chelsea,4,"My first Oliver Sacks. I really enjoyed these small snippets into various scientific fields studied by the author. Darwin, evolution, time, speed, the nature of scientific discoveries, medical diagnoses, and more in easy-to-digest and entertaining chapters. I will never look at Tourette's syndrome the same way again. Fascinating. Also, I listened to the #audiobook which was nicely done. "
107,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47665820-robert-kortus,3,"This book is a little different than most of Sacks's books. It explores his thoughts on some of his favorite scientists, such as Fraud and Darwin. It's not as enjoyable or interesting as his other books which explore case studies. I'd say if you're a big Sacks fan, check it out, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is new to Sacks. "
108,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6037327-richard-levine,4,"This is very interesting collection of essays that was put together by Oliver Sacks's associates after his death. Rather than focusing on neurological conditions or case histories, as Sacks's books often do, these pieces explore a broader range of scientific topics. And while it is clear that this is a compilation of previously published essays, the pieces fit together fairly well, as the more general unifying theme seems to be Sacks' fascination in scientific exploration - what it is about, how it progresses. In that vein, two of his essays discuss some of Charles Darwin's lesser-known (post- Origin of Species) work, and one is about Freud's work on neurological topics before he turned to psychiatry. I found especially appealing the pieces on memory and creativity, as well as the book's concluding essay, a discussion of ""forgetting and neglect"" in science. In this last piece Sacks writes about examples of scientific discoveries that were, for various reasons, either completely overlooked at the time or quickly forgotten, so that the same ""discovery"" had to be made by another scientist -- who reaped the fame and credit -- decades (or even centuries) later. As Sacks goes on to say, this suggests that the evolution of science, like the evolution of life, did not progress over an inevitable course; that ""science is not an ineluctable process but contingent in the extreme."" "
109,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7607058-susan-oleksiw,5,"Dr. Oliver Sacks was working on this collection of essays when he died, but fortunately his colleagues finished the work for him. Always challenging and informative, Sacks covers a variety of topics indicative of his wide-ranging interests but all tied to the field of neuroscience. In ten essays Sacks explores Darwin's later interest in botany, the concept of time, the mental lives of plants and worms, Freud's twenty years as a neurologist, the fallibility of memory, Sacks's growing awareness of his loss of hearing, how does the creative self emerge, what a feeling of disorder means, what does a river of consciousness mean and is there flow or discrete images, and the early insights of scientists who were later forgotten, along with their work.This book is challenging to the non-scientist but Sacks is talented in making his work and thinking accessible. Although not filled with the captivating life stories as often found in his other work, he still refers to figures well known through his books and articles, encouraging readers to search out his earlier work."
110,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7966531-akshat,4,"This is Dr. Sacks's last work. Contrary to his other books, this does not focus on a set of specific medical histories but addresses broader topics like Dr. Sacks's influences - Freud and Darwin, creativity, remembering and time. As always Dr. Sacks is illuminating and a delight to read. I felt this a book you'd truly enjoy by highlighting sections and paragraphs and re-reading(rather reflecting upon) them at a later time."
111,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71552313-margaret-tuomi,4,"I am a big fan of Oliver Sacks, I read all of his books. The River of Consciousness is a posthumously written book fleshing out the scientific elements of Sacks’ understanding of consciousness. It may sound like a tedious book to read, but it is not. Rather it is thought provoking and interesting. Towards the end of the book. Sacks references his previous books and how and why they were written. I recommend this book to others. "
112,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873780-michael,4,"This is the last work produced by Oliver Sacks prior to his death, and in many ways it encapsulates his life work. Sacks is a neurologist with keen perceptive abilities and a unique ability to capture the varieties of human experience and illustrate them in a captivating and engaging fashion. I discovered him as a young man and he has had a powerful influence in my own choice of career as a psychiatrist. Sacks is probably most famous for his powerful descriptions of the effects of L-dopa on patients with post encephalitic Parkinson's diseas,e as made famous in his book ""Awakenings"" and the movie adaptation of it. In this last work of his Sacks goes on a meandering exploration on the potential varieties of consciousness that may exist in the living world, entertaining the possibilities of animal and even plant consciousness, and how it would differ from our own. He explores the varieties of human consciousness in such conditions as Tourette's and brain injury and goes on to explore the fickleness of human memory and the workings of the creative process. He concludes with some fascinating examples of how culture interacts with the creative process both enabling and constraining it. All in all this is a delightful concluding work for Oliver Sacks, who has been such an important ambassador of our current age of discovery for the workings of the mind."
113,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50966121-peter-geyer,5,"I've never bought anything by Oliver Sacks, notwithstanding his reputation. This may be because I don't really like clinical (or otherwise) case studies or to delve all too much into psychopathology, although I do that more than the norm, I suppose.But a title like The River of Consciousness can't be ignored, by me at any rate, providing it's not a guru/self-help thing. I even bought the more expensive hardcover, with its somewhat mysterious green and grey mix of water and foliage.The inside is full of erudition: Darwin and plants, Freud as a neurologist, neglect in science, consciousness of course. I was going to write that Sacks writes extraordinarily well, but apparently this book was dictated. However written, there are clear insights into Darwin as a person and how he went about things, into Freud, where Sacks suggests that in letters a person might better explain their ideas, and how consciousness might be explained and also operate, the metaphor of film for the latter.There are other things besides, but there is something to think about in every chapter on almost every page. The way Sacks puts things makes it possible to see where various thinkers and researchers are in many ways on the same page, albeit a large one and in different languages and locations. "
114,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5144682-biljana,3,"I'm torn on this one, so I'd give it 3.5 but I'm rounding up to 4 stars.I love Oliver Sacks and the books that I've read by him (The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat and An Anthropologist on Mars are divine). This collection of disparate pieces definitely reflects Sacks' skill at writing about complex topics and making them accessible. I particularly enjoyed the meditations on evolution, memory, and time but, overall, this collection didn't grab my attention in the same way as his other books. I think that many will enjoy this collection, though. "

116,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7582369-kc,4,"Oliver Sachs was a pioneer in the science community when it came to the brain, neuroscience, and consciousness. This book is a collection of essays that was outlined 2 weeks before this death. Although much of what was written was most likely reviewed in earlier works, I found the chapter The Fallibility of Memory extremely fascinating and for me, quite personal. "
117,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587406-elk,4,"Sacks has a beautiful way of turning stories of science into thoughtful meditations about what it means to be human. His essays are interesting, personal and illuminating. This collection was a pleasure to read. Notes As you know, I am working on the assumption that our psychical mechanism has come into being by a process of stratification: the material present in the form of memory-traces being subjected from time to time to a re-arrangement in accordance with fresh circumstances—a re-transcription... Memory is present not once but several times over... the suggestive registrations representing the phychic achievement of successive epochs of life... [Frued]The potential for therapy, for change, therefore, lies in the capacity to exhume such 'fixated' material into the present so that it can be subjected to the creative process of retranscription and thus allow the stalled individual to grow once again and change once again. (pg. 97-98)In his theory of neuronal group selection, Gerald Edelman—drawing on the data of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, of embryology and evolutionary biology, of clinical and experimental work, and of synthetic neural modeling—proposes a detailed neurobiological model of the mind in which the brain's central role is precisely that of constructing categories—first perceptual, then conceptual—and of an ascending process, a ""bootstrapping,"" where through repeating recategorization at higher and higher levels, consciousness is finally achieved. (pg. 99) I suspect that many of my enthusiasms and impulses, which seem entirely my own, have arisen from others’ suggestions, which have powerfully influenced me, consciously or unconsciously, and then been forgotten... This type of forgetting may be necessary for a creative or healthy cryptomnesia, one that allows old thoughts to be reassembled, retranscribed, recategorized, given new and fresh implications. (pg. 107-108)Or was the problem essentially one of incubation that he had not allowed himself enough time for the experience of reading Awakenings to sink in? Nor had he allowed himself, as Pinter did, time to forget it, to let it fall into his unconscious, where it might link with other experiences and thoughts.All of us, to some extent, borrow from others, from the culture around us. Ideas are in the air, and we may appropriate, often without realizing, the phrases and language of the times. We borrow language itself; we did not invent it. We found it, we grew up into it, though we may use it, interpret it, in very individual ways. What is at issue is not the fact of “borrowing” or “imitating,” of being “derivative,” being “influenced,” but what one does with what is borrowed or imitated or derived; how deeply one assimilates it, takes it into oneself, compounds it with one’s own experiences and thoughts and feelings, places it in relation to oneself, and expresses it in a new way, one’s own. (pg. 142)""The knowledge of some other part of the stream, past or future, near or remote, is always mixed in with our knowledge of the present thing. These lingerings of old objects, these incomings of new, are the germs of memory and expectation, the retrospective and the prospective sense of time. They give that continuity to consciousness without which it could not be called a stream."" William James (pg. 164)For consciousness is always active and selective—charged with feelings and meanings uniquely our own, informing our choices and interfusing our perceptions. So it is not just Seventh Avenue I see but my Seventh Avenue, marked by my own selfhood and identity... [W]e deceive ourselves if we imagine that we can ever be passive, impartial observers. Every perception, every scene, is shaped by us, whether we intend it or know it, or not. We are the directors of the film we are making – but we are its subjects too: every frame, every moment, is us, is ours... Our passing thoughts, as William James says (in an image that smacks of cowboy life in the 1880s), do not wander round like wild cattle. Each one is owned and bears the brand of this ownership, and each thought, in James's words, is born an owner of the thoughts that went before, and “dies owned, transmitting whatever it realized as its Self to its own later proprietor."" (pg. 183)""Each science,"" he wrote, ""has a sort of attic into which things are almost automatically pushed that cannot be used at the moment, that do not quite fit... We are constantly putting aside, unused, a wealth of valuable material [that leads to] the blocking of scientific progress."" Wolfgang Kohler (pg. 202)"
118,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"It is sad to think that Oliver Sacks is no longer here to write another book. I might be his ideal audience -- the liberal-arts-oriented generalist a bit light on the scientific side. Perhaps the pleasure of reading him comes from his often taking a historical approach to science, or to his liberal sharing of his own case studies, which seem pulled from exploratory novels.The essay is his  pièce de résistance,  as it were, and this collection lays out a bountiful 10-course meal of them. There is one that hits quite close to home -- ""Mishearings"" -- in which he ponders the formation of presbycuses, those words or phrases formed by the brain of a hearing-impaired person. These are relatively new to Sachs's personal experience, and like a good scientist he keeps a diary of them ""as my deafness increases."" I am that hearing-impaired person as well, but with a lifetime of presbycuses, so it is rewarding to read of such perceptual errors becoming the grist for scientific exploration: he discounts the Freudian explanation (that they reflect ""repressed feeling and conflict"") in favor of one that privileges the depth and breadth of the experience, ""the power of neural mechanisms combined with the open and unpredictable nature of language"" to generate linguistic perceptions that often seem to ""reflect ... one's own interests and experiences."" For Sachs these are such things as ""chiropractor"" being heard as ""choir practice,"" ""tarot cards"" become ""pteropods,"" and ""Christmas Eve"" is ""kiss my feet.""""The Creative Self"" is also not unfamiliar, as it relates to the subliminal state into which it is possible to submerge oneself while writing and composing. In his description, for himself, it is a ""state when ideas seem to organize themselves into a swift, tightly-woven flow, with a feeling of gorgeous clarity and meaning emerging"" when he can ""bypass or transcend much of my personality, my neuroses."" It is at one and the same time both the best part of him and not-him. The essay leading to this conclusion is about the connection between this experience and the preparation required for it through such distinct, non-creative stages as education, skill-formation, and mimicry.For enjoyment, however, the best essays had subjects with which I was entirely unfamiliar, or even a little averse. This was the case with ""Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers."" Botany always bores me, but this was an exhilarating essay that recounted the manner in which Darwin (among a great other things) revealed flowers to be cross-fertilized. Up to that point scientists regarded them as universally self-fertilizing. (Similar, although less thrilling to me, is the essay ""The Other Road: Freud as Neurologist."") ""Sentience: The Mental Lives of Plants and Worms"" should be read by every human being in order to put them in a right relationship with the speedy worm and the intelligent jellyfish, who no less than we have sensory apparatus that generate ""complex adaptive behaviors"" and coordinate ""sensory and motor mechanisms."" It's not all blind instinct.Other essays are ones on speed, the fallibility of memory, scotoma (forgetting and neglect) in science i.e. when scientific discoveries are made only to be overlooked or forgotten because the scientific world was not ready for them, and migraines (""A General Feeling of Disorder"").The title essay contains a  précis  of the world that Sachs explored: ""Is it possible to define the almost inconceivably complex processes that form the neural correlates of thought and consciousness? We must imagine, if we can, that in our brains with their hundred billion neurons, each with a thousand or more synaptic connections, there may emerge or be selected, within fractions of a second, a million-odd neuronal groups or coalitions, each with a thousand or ten thousand neurons apiece. ... We cannot begin to catch the density, the multifariousness of it all, the superimposed and mutually influencing layers of the stream of consciousness as it flows, constantly changing, through the mind."" But nonetheless it is the job of neuroscience and psychology to explore these processes and how ""relatively simple"" sensation makes the ""leap"" into human consciousness. Every individual is a ""collection of moments"" that has been channeled into a mighty river."
119,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2833014-kristi,4,"I first fell in love with the mind of Oliver Sachs when I read ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"". As a psychologist I am always interested in motivations and the intricacies of the human mind. In this last book before his death, Sachs takes on such a variety of subjects that I feel I need to review as I read rather than waiting until the end. ""Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers"" We are all, I hope, aware of Darwin's work on the origin of species and evolution. I was not aware that he wrote more extensively about botanical adaptations than animal. At 71 it is so lovely to learn something new every day. I have long been aware of the designation of certain plants as ""butterfly gardens"". I never wondered why certain plants attract these wonderful creatures. Now I know. "" While bees are attracted to blue and yellow flowers, they ignore red ones, because they are red-blind. Butterflies, with good red vision, fertilize red flowers but may ignore the blue and violet ones. Flowers pollinated by night-flying moths tend to lack color but to exude their scents at night."" Don't you just love it!! What a mind Darwin had to observe, often in his own back yard, the evolutionary behaviors / changes of plants. ""Speed"" This sections begins with a look at our perception of time. When bored, time drags forever. When occupied no awareness of the passages of time exists. The more interesting discussion concerns speed in human behavior from akinesia ( the absence of movement ) in catatonia or Parkinson's to hyperkinesia in Tourettes Syndrome. For example in the latter when films of a person's face over time were slowed down, hundreds of mini-tic were seen to occur. Sacks also discusses ""Awakenings"", the book and film which starred Robin Williams and dealt with medication produced changes in movement among patients seemingly frozen due to post encephalitis brain damage..... ""Sentience: the Mental life of Plants and Worms""Truly the mental life of worms has no great interest for me, but this chapter is part of the progression toward defining brain, mind, and learning. When even single cell protozoans can demonstrate ""learning"" what then is the real definition of mind? This is a river of discovery of the nature of human consciousness. What I have found interesting is the inter-connectivity of plants, especially trees. ""The Other Road - Freud as Neurologist"" As a psychologist and college teacher of the subject, I have to honestly admit that I was not aware of Freud's extensive work in the field of neurology. By the time he entered the field, phrenology ( the location of brain function via the shape / bumps of one's head was falling into disrepute. There was, however, increasing localization of brain functions to specific parts of the brain. Working with Charcot Freud began to focus on neurological disorders like strokes, seizures, and migraines. In practice he also began to encounter functional disorders like hysterias, obsessive-compulsive disorders, neuroses and psychoses. The difficulty lay in separating the disorders due to physical damage to the nervous system versus damage to the ""mind"". As his interest shifted from neurology to psychoanalysis, one may contemplate whether Freud moved too far away from physical causation to complete psycho-genesis. The Fallibility of Memory deals with the idea that memories that we regard as happening to us may have been borrowed ( not intentionally ) from stories we have been told about our child that they become so real that we see them as memories. An interesting example of the accidental ""borrowing"" of facts concerned George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord"" which was judged as plagiarism of Ronald Mack's song ""He's so Fine"" written 8 years earlier. The judge believed that Harrison had not intended to steal the song, but it had entered his memory without his actively recalling it.... I have to skip ahead a bit and talk about the river of consciousness. This chapter discusses the fusion of multiple sensory images with interpretation to create a smooth and selective consciousness. Scotoma - a word with which I was not familiar - refers to a blindness in the visual field. Sachs uses the word to describe eras of blindness or denial of scientific facts. One of the easiest to describe is the fact that the ancient Greeks in the 3rd century B.C. or B.C.E had a heliocentric ( the sun was the center of the solar system. Then Ptolemy 5 centuries later made the earth the center. This blindness persisted for 1,400 years until Copernicus corrected the fallacy. There are many such periods of discover, loss, and rediscovery in science. I must stop..... What is always delightful about reading Oliver Sachs is his ability to find almost any subject or human behavior fascinating and making it just as interesting for his reader. We have lost a great man. Kristi & Abby Tabby"
120,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9498305-william-adams,3,"Neurologist Oliver Sacks achieved acclaim for his 1985 book of clinical cases, “The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat.” This book is also a collection of essays, though wider ranging and not clinical case-studies. Topics include evolution, psychoanalysis, memory and forgetting, and how scientific thought develops over time. They reflect Sacks’s opinions on these subjects, and although the work is footnoted, with references, the essays are point of view pieces rather than close scientific reviews of the facts. The first chapter, for example, is a gauzy, sentimental remembrance of his childhood garden. It is supposed to evoke the sense of wonder and scientific curiosity that something as simple as close inspection of a flower can bring. The essays become more interesting as the book progresses. I particularly enjoyed one that made a convincing case that trees are sentient in their own way. It made me reconsider the definition of “sensation.” That’s when Sacks is at his best. I also liked reading of Freud’s pre-psychoanalytic work in anatomy. A Kuhnian essay on scientific discoveries that were so far ahead of their time that they could not be digested by the scientific community was enlightening. Many of those ideas were simply ignored and ""rediscovered"" decades, if not centuries later when scientists were ready to deal with them. These highlights are mixed with less compelling articles that seemed to perpetuate myths in cognitive psychology, such as the idea that specific memories are related to Hebbian “circuits” in the brain. I also thought his ideas on the nature of consciousness were weak, mainly a rehash of William James, who I never found convincing. Modern science tends to be extremely granular and data-driven, often very hard to put into context. These essays are high-level stories of large scientific ideas, so the work is accessible to the general reader and is at a level of interpretation we don’t get from reading the original sources. At the same time, Sacks’s interpretations could easily be misunderstood as scientific findings rather than mere opinions. That is a compromise any writer of popular science must make.The book is indexed and has a useful bibliography of primary and secondary sources. It’s an easy read if you’re up to date on cognitive psychology, and if you’re not, it’s a good introduction to a range of scientific ideas diffusely organized around the topic of consciousness. And of course the book is a must-have for Oliver Sacks fans.Sacks was a successful popularizer and explainer of science, much as Stephen Jay Gould was before him and Neil DeGrasse Tyson is now. Sacks’s light yet scholarly tone does remind me of Gould’s collections like “The Panda’s Thumb.” Many of these essays appeared earlier in The New Yorker and other publications. Some are new. They were assembled into this book after his death in 2015 and the volume is marketed as a fond remembrance of the man as much as for its content. "

This collection is a bit of an overview of all Sacks has come to think about and learn, scientifically, in his life of scientific scholarly pursuits.From the essay, ""Speed"": P. 41 - ""Sometimes when one is falling asleep, there may be a massive, involuntary jerk (a 'myoclonic' jerk) of the body. Though such jerks are generated by primitive parts of the brain stem (they are, so to speak, brain-stem reflexes) and as such are without any intrinsic meaning or motive, they may be given meaning and connect, turned into acts, by an instantly improvised dream.""From the essay, ""Sentience: The Mental Lives of Plants and Worms"":P. 73 - ""He (Jennings) felt that we humans are reluctant to attribute any qualities of mind to protozoa because they are so small: 'The writer is thoroughly convinced, after long study, of the behavior of this organism, that if Amoeba were a large animal, so as to come within the everyday experience of human beings, its behavior would at once call forth the attribution to it of states of pleasure and pain, of hunger, desire, and the like, on precisely the same basis we attribute these things to the dog.' Jennings' vision of a highly sensitive, dog-sized Amoeba is almost cartoonishly opposite of Descartes's notion of dogs as so devoid of feelings that one could vivisect them without compunction, taking their cries as purely 'reflex' reactions of a quasi-mechanical kind.""P. 75 - ""It has even been shown, in a highly social species of paper wasp, they individuals can learn and recognize the faces of other wasps. Such face learning has hitherto been described only in mammals; it is fascinating they a cognitive power so specific can be present in insects as well.""From the essay, ""Mishearings"":P. 125 - ""Mishearings are not hallucinations, but like hallucinations they utilize the usual pathways of perception and pose as reality - it does not occur to one to question them.""From the essay, ""A General Feeling of Disorder"":P. 152 - ""Though there are many (one is tempted to say, innumerable) possible presentations of common migraine - I describe nearly a hundred such in my book - it's commonest harbinger may be just an indefinable but undeniable feeling of something amiss. This is exactly what Emil du Bois-Reymond emphasized when, in 1860, he described his own attacks of migraine. 'I wake,' he writes, ""with a general feeling of disorder.'"""

Turns out this was an unfinished manuscript that Sacks was working on when he passed away. Some things I learned:- Chamption sprinters can be off the blocks with a gun shot in less than a third of the time it takes for their consciousness to recognize that there was a gunshot, which is evidence to how our brain works to make sense of time and sequence for a cacophany of sense organs that all operate at different speeds- Parkinson's disease patients experience time and spacial frames of reference differently than us, resulting in accelerated or attenuated behavior and micrographia. (threads like this are repeats to another book I read by Sacks, Musicophilia, which leads me to wonder how much of his many books is just him repeating himself)- Freud spent the first 20 years of his career in basic research, studying nerobiology, before entering clinical practice and inventing the theories that made him famous. Some nerobiologists (e.g. Eric Kandel) speculate that Freud might have been known as a ""cofounder of the neuron doctrine, instead of as the father of psychoanalysis"". - Freud always believed that there had to be a biological basis for all psychology, and departed from biology when he realized that there was just too much complexity there and too little known to address the psychological questions he had in mind. He returned to trying to connect the two late in his career, to no avail (much like, I suppose, Einstein did in his own field)- Box jellyfish are the only jellyfish to have image forming eyes, and brains capable of memory and other complex behaviors they use for hunting- Some highly social species of paper wasp can recognize each others' faces, which was an ability only otherwise seen in mammals- When Hellen Keller was accused of plagiarism, Mark Twain wrote her a sweet, supportive letter making fun of people who found this to be a controversial, claiming that many people - including himself - unwittingly plagiarize- Consciousness appears to have first arisen in reptiles, and is not identified in amphibians. ""A frog, for example, shows no active attention, and no visual following of events. A frog does not have a visual world or visual consciousness as we know it, only a purely automatic ability to recognize an insect-like object if one enters its visual field, and to dart out its tongue in response. It does not scan its surroundings or look for prey."""

Knopf: New York; $27.00, hardback What do we really know about our own brain? How do insight, dreams, ideas, memory and all other experiences of the mind work? Oliver Sachs, a the renowned neurologist who brought his life's study to the average reader in great popular works such as The Mind's Eye, Anthropologist on Mars, and Migraine, is perhaps best remembered for Awakenings, a Robin Williams film which explored a true case of recovery of mental capacity in numerous chronically near comatose people. Sachs is a wonder to read, and his thoughts in this book bear reading, not to mention appreciating. In this book, planned and written shortly before his recent death, we learn of Sack's explorations suggested by his thoughts on other great men, not all of whom were doctors. We find a remarkable study of time and speed. Examining the era of photography and early films, we investigate why time matters and how it impacts us in concrete ways. Why do near death experiences seem to slow time down? Most remarkable to me was a consideration of time as a river. Is our memory flowing consciousness or a series of beads on a string, event after event? Most memorable are the examples he offers to illustrate these ideas. One poor man lived in the eternal present, each event experienced, but unrelated to what came before or after. Or, consider botany. Darwin and even Freud offered early awareness of sensing in plants. What causes ivy to grow and twist upwards on a vine? Is there something which 'sees' that causes this movement? What can the brains of simple sea snails tell us about the functioning of our own brain? Can evolution be seen in plants, and so transmuted to further comprehension of the strange developments in humans?  And what of memory itself? Sachs offers example after example of how ideas, creative ideas, burst upon us unexpectedly. We don't know how they came, or from whence they originated. Could these ideas be derivative,from information heard once, and then forgotten by the conscious brain? Are the ideas held in a sort of well of forgetfulness until joined in our own subconscious with ideas we are wondering about now? I wonder. Sachs is one of my favorite writers. The only downside is occasionally he will use medical terms which are unknown to me, and cause a full stop in my understanding. Perhaps there is something there, too, in how our brain works."

THE RIVER OF CONSCIOUSNESS http://fangswandsandfairydust.com/201...Sometimes popular non-fiction with science may be a great book, with excellent narration, but science can be hard to follow in an audio format.I first read Sack’s best-selling book THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT around 1989 and was fascinated by the cases he discussed. After all our perceptions define the world around us via our senses and when those go awry we humans compensate, or we do not.That Sacks, who passed away in 2015, was a brilliant, erudite, and articulate writer could never be in question. Indeed even dead he is a thousand times smarter than I ever was or will be.That disparity in intelligence made this book a great read but not a great listen for me as I generally listen and do manual tasks, chores, drive or paint at the same time. This audio book contains essays that present “seminal ideas of human endeavor.” (http://www.penguinrandomhouseaudio.co...) in a way that requires concentrated listening. I am too antsy to listen and not engage in non-linguistic tasks. My mind had a hard time following the essays to their conclusions. They sure sound brilliant, but I had a hard time following the well-researched and scholarly essays when I only listened to the book. However, if I listened and read at the same time the work makes more sense.The narrator, Dan Woren, has a smooth and easy voice, like a new anchor or a favorite teacher. His narration was pleasant to hear without nasality or stentorian volume. I am pretty sure the second narrator, Kate Edgar, only does the introduction.Sometimes it seems to go around the block a bit more than necessary to tell us about how Darwin was not just a geologist but a botanist and how he altered what the science of botany encompassed. I am still not sure if that was the thrust of the essay. I did follow and enjoy “The Fallibility of Memory.” I also found the essay “Mishearing” easier to follow and enjoyed its humor.Reading fiction and non-fiction in audio format is distinctly different from reading the printed word. I think this is a hard listen to follow and absorb, but while it is not an easy read, it is easier to follow the thoughts and ideas expounded by this brilliant doctor in print."
125,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"As always, Sacks provides many insights from his studies of the human mind.In the chapter Speed, Sacks points out that motor decisions can be faster (130 ms) than conscious registration (400 ms), affecting our perception of the passage of time. Time does pass at different rates for persons with certain disorders - more slowly with Parkinson's and more quickly with Tourette's syndrome, even though those affected believe their rate to be normal. Persons with Tourette's can catch flies on the wing. They can reach out at 7 meters/sec while a normal person can only achieve 4.5 m/s. Dopamine appears to control the rate of time passage and dopamine levels can be adjusted with certain drugs. It is not clear what factors govern the normal rate.The chapter Fallibility of Memory describes how we transfer experiences, sometimes believing that something we read about, were told about or dreamed about - actually happened to us. ""This is especially apt to happen with one's earliest experiences."" Further, ideas that we have absorbed and forgotten can be remembered as original thoughts. Sacks reviews a number of examples where an author thought they had recorded original work, only to find that they had used previously assimilated ideas from other sources - thereby unconsciously committing plagiarism.In the chapter The Creative Self, Sacks examines creativity. While much learning involves absorbing current knowledge, at some point the mind breaks off to the creation of new material. Interesting are the examples where the mind has created ideas without the person actually consciously thinking about the problem.The chapter Forgetting and Neglect in Science examines changing views of the work of past scientists, putting forth a number of inconclusive ideas. Good quotes from Einstein and Helmholz on the advancement of scientific knowledge. Einstein pointed out that new theories don't necessarily invalidate older ones, but allow us to regain our older concepts from a higher level. He likened the scientific process to climbing a mountain where new and wider views are gained and new connections are discovered. Helmholz also used a mountaineering analogy where the initial climb is often trial and error, but upon achieving the summit sometimes a direct route can be seen."
126,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10419881-kim,4,"I've been a fan of the podcast Radiolab for years, and I always enjoyed the segments where the neurologist, Doctor Oliver Sacks, was a guest. He wasn't just in episodes about the brain, either. Sacks could speak about a dizzying array of subjects, and his ability to explain the most difficult topics helped make science accessible to a broader audience.The River of Consciousness is a collection of essays Sacks wrote in the months leading up to his death. They cover topics like Darwin's flower studies, how the brain processes speech it mishears, and how a culture can 'forget' basic scientific concepts before they are 'rediscovered' years later. Each essay is written with the clear, lyrical prose that Sacks was known for. They read like stories and it's not until the end that you realize that 1) you have learned quite a lot, and 2) you are suddenly interested in an esoteric topic you'd never heard of before. Sacks uncomplicates complicated ideas, presenting case histories to explain his concepts. He gives readers the key to these strange happenings so they might begin to understand them.One thing that Sacks is notable for is his ability to notice the oddities of his own body- after surgery, after cancer treatments, and even as his body was failing in the last weeks of his life- and use these instances as a launchpad for his own curiosity and research. For example, in the essay, Mishearings, Sacks talks about the day he misheard his friend and thought she was going to 'choir practice'. He puzzled over this fact for some time because she had never expressed an interest in singing in a choir. It turns out that she was talking about going to the chiropractor. But of course, Sacks didn't let things end there. He recorded what he misheard, compared it to what was actually said, and used these mishearings to explain how the brain perceives words and makes sense of errors. Sacks' curiosity never ceases to amaze me. His willingness to keep an open mind and look into illnesses and phenomena that others dismissed helped so many people through the years. His ability to shed light the strangest, most complex scientific concepts has helped explain them to people around the world, making these intimidating topics more relatable. Reading The River of Consciousness makes me want to go back and find all the Radiolab episodes Sacks was on, and then read every book he wrote. We need more writers like him. The world can be frightening, and it can seem like science is unsure of anything. But with more writers like Sacks opening our eyes to the wonder of this crazy world, we could see that science seeks to move us ever forward. It is how we make sense of things, and with more understanding, it can help us all to conquer our fears."
127,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22233971-jim-clinton-slusher,3,"This is a very interesting collection of essays. However, I finished it so long ago, that I’m not comfortable trying to write a cogent, specific review. I think what I found most interesting is that I was reading it at about the same time I was reading a collection of Stephen Hawking essays published posthumously. That turned out to be fortunate because the speculations of the two men, although often on somewhat different lines of thought, complemented each other and helped me understand the ideas the other man was explaining. I especially found some of Sacks’ ideas about what makes up “consciousness” particularly intriguing. I must say, though, that while I can’t hope to compare with the level of rigor and investigation they’ve given to their subjects, I disagree with Hawking and Sacks on some fundamental conclusions that they draw. Hawking’s descriptions of black holes and the origins of the universe build from mathematics and scientific experimentation but ultimately arrive at conclusions that are by definition as speculative and arguable as anything religion produces. Lacking any understanding beyond what science can show him, Hawking ultimately decides that in the beginning there was nothing and then magically (a term he wouldn’t use of course, but is still apropos) a Big Bang occurred and everything else flowed from that. Well, OK, I’ll accept that as one potential alternative, but it’s no more authoritative than to say that in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And Sacks breaks consciousness down into simultaneously a virtual acid trip of metaphysical functions and a dry collection of electrical impulses. Again, I accept that his world view is one alternative, but I do not accept that it excludes others - including that people have something we might call souls - that are equally compatible with the evidence available. Clearly, this is a book that can get you going, and I’m sure I’ll read it again at some point in order to better understand and engage more deeply with Sacks’ ideas."

It is a collection of loosely related essays some of which have been previously published in the New York Review of Books (or maybe the New Yorker) I just know I recognized a couple of the pieces close to the back of the book.Probably either of his books: ""The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat"" or ""An Anthropologist on Mars"" might have been titled ""The River of Consciousness"" as they both explore the far ends of neurological oddity. It's what he does. Oliver Sacks is a curious porpoise who will stimulate your curiosity in a gentle teasing way. Those books and this one are made up of fascinating shorts written in ordinary language. You might pick one up and read the chapters out of order or two at a time or all at once - it's not a book that requires any commitment. It's just interesting, engaging, and educational without being preachy.By contrast his books ""Hallucinations"" and ""Musciophilla"" read like continuous narrative. Those books are interesting as well, but require a little more commitment - as you can't skip chapters and expect to understand what is going on, lol. If you like this one, pick of one of those - there are no bad Sacks' books. Each one is a delight in its own way.Unlike ""The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hate,"" this book is NOT a collection of case studies of Dr. Sacks. These essays are on Darwin, Freud and other notables of science. If you have even a passing interest in evolution, or the history of science, neurology or the secret life of plants, prepare to be enthralled. I read his books like candy for my brain. If I ever come across one I haven't read I pick it up and read it immediately. I haven't been disappointed yet. :)"

Not surprisingly, I ignored the ""advice"". But then one of my college textbooks had an excerpt from Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales, which excerpt I enjoyed. So when I stumbled on this posthumous collection of essays by Sacks at the public library, I decided to give it a try. (There is some, but very little, on Tourette's in this volume.)These essays are a surprising case of science writing that is (usually) accessible to a layperson, due to a conversational style instead of lecturing. Some topics I found more interesting than others, and some essays were easier to read than others. On the whole, I enjoyed this collection. (I don't know how much of the information I will retain in a few weeks, since I opened this up as an escape from a hectic weekend, with no intent to actually study.)My rating breakdown by essay, based on both readability and subjective interest:Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers - 4.5Speed - 5Sentience: The Mental Lives of Plants and Worms - 2.5The Other Road: Freud as Neurologist - 2The Fallibility of Memory - 5Mishearings - 4.5The Creative Self - 4A General Feeling of Disorder - 2.5The River of Consciousness - 3Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science - 3.5(average: 3.65)"
130,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47168106-otempora,3,"The River of Consciousness' title comes from Borges, but it's an incisive choice for this posthumous essay collection. The essays flow one into another, each topic linked in a steady stream, and the individual pieces likewise follow Sacks' various interests wherever they may lead. The first essay, on Darwin's interest in botany, is decently interesting but reads like an article you'd casually flip through in The Atlantic or National Geographic. The next, however, is what really sets the tone for the book: in the essay ""Speed,"" Sacks' musings on the titular phenomenon range from childhood photography experiments to H.G. Wells' science fiction to the neurological investigations of his adult career, one topic shifting seamlessly into the next. The idea of a ""river of consciousness"" speaks to this unhurried, unstructured, and perhaps even passive flow, but it also suggests the possibility for more active engagement: lift your head up a bit, or hang onto a rock, or maybe even try swimming upstream; see what you notice. And that, more than anything, is the underlying principle of Sacks' varied subjects. So much that we take for granted has fascinating or bewildering implications, if we're willing to do the mental work and look for them. River of Consciousness was not a life-changing book for me, and probably not the most arresting scientific nonfiction I've ever read. But as far as required summer reading goes, it was a pleasant journey to the banks of a river that hadn't previously explored. "
131,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4004337-karen,4,"I’ve been wanting to read something by Oliver Sacks for a while so I had pretty high expectations. Strangely enough I found myself intensely drawn into some chapters (specifically the sections on Darwin, speed, general feeling of disorder and river of consciousness) and others very much uninterested and disengaged. And these corresponded to the very start of the book as well as near the end. So it’s hard to tell if I had too many external distractions happening when I was reading and I just picked a bad time to pick up the book. (Want to make note of this if I ever read again).So if I could I would make my rating somewhere between 3 and 4.Regardless, Sacks is a really an excellent writer and story teller, and he really blows you away with his knowledge in such a expansive range of topics.. from medicine, botany, history, arts, evolution. And he somehow does is it all in a poetical, beautiful voice that helps bring clarity to a lot of deep complex areas (what makes up consciousness, rare neurotically disorders, how the brain forms memories, the meaning of the evolution). I also really liked that you get bits and pieces of his life through the chapters and I found myself wanting to hear more about his many fascinating experiences. He makes reference to several of his other works throughout the book so it’s great to have a better sense of what these are all about and which ones I want to read next:-The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat-An Anthropologist on Mars-Awakenings -Hallucinations-On the Move"
132,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1274406-cami,4,"I have been a huge fan of Dr. Oliver Sacks and his advanced thoughts on neuroscience and life in general for many, many years. I have read all of his (sometimes long and tedious books) to pull out the true gems of his mind and even studied neuroscience in college myself, partly to understand him better. I heard him speak in person in 2002 and was honored to be in his presence, though I would have loved to talk with him one on one. This book was compiled and published shortly after his death. While some of the chapters were more stale than others, I learned something from each chapter. The first chapter almost had me putting the book down for good, but when he mentioned his patients from ""Awakenings,"" he had me hooked. I loved his thoughts on the creative self (though I wish he would acknowledge a spiritual side of life and give credit to the inner soul inside humans), and need someone else I know to read that chapter so we can talk about it! The chapters on speed, the fallibility of memory, mishearings, and the scotomas of science gave me a lot to ponder. Dr. Sacks is the ideal doctor--searching medical texts back for centuries until he finds what he is looking for and taking his patients seriously. Not everyone will appreciate his scientific mind, but this book makes me want to put my hand on my heart and take a little bow of respect for the man and his contributions to science."
133,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69765813-cole-biehl,5,"Having listened to the audiobook months ago I decided to knock this book out over the past few days. It only took me four days or so to read it, it is a short read. Consuming anything written by Oliver Sacks is an enjoyable use of one's time in my opinion. What I liked most about this book had little to do with the title ""The River of Consciousness"". While the chapter titled the same as the book's title was a fascinating insight into Sack's impression of what consciousness is. Ultimately I enjoyed reading Sack's other chapters where he so beautifully explained facets of Darwin's life I was completely unaware of. For example, that Darwin published nearly 100 paper on botany and plant related studies. I found his breadth of scientific knowledge to be inspiring. As someone about to enter the study and field of medicine, I hope to one day have as concise a grasp of scientific topics as diverse as botany, chemistry, biology, neurology, the origin of life, and science history as Dr. Sacks so readily displayed in his writing. His comments on the evolution of scientific understanding was also fascinating to me. That perhaps like organic life on our planet, intellectual or ideological evolution and growth can happen in periods of rapid advancement, or even enter periods of prolonged dormancy. Dr. Sacks will forever live on in his writings and I will forever be grateful for having discovered them. "
134,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4479135-sheridan,0,"This is Oliver Sacks' last collection of essays before his death in 2015. I went for it mostly on the title, I remembered reading Dennett's Consciousness Explained and not being super satisfied so I was very interested to hear Sacks' take on consciousness, and hear some more of his other stories.The pieces that stuck with me the most here were actually the ones least connected to consciousness thematically, but the ones about the history of science. The one I enjoyed most was probably the story of Darwin as a botanist. It's crazy how much Darwin got right about evolution given that obviously he had no idea about genes or DNA, but likely never even heard of Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance either. My other favorite piece was about Freud the neurologist, which was a very cool reappraisal for me since I think a lot of Freudian psych shit is kind of hard to take seriously.Everything else is enjoyable too of course, like ""Speed"" about the perception of time and how drugs or mental conditions might affect it, or talking about originality and creativity in ""The Creative Self."" Some of the essays naturally are in a bit of an unfocused state but just reading Sacks' musings about his own conscious/unconscious processes and experiences well motivated me to think about my own. My only real complaint is that I would have liked to hear more about Sacks' opinion on the nature and origin of consciousness, which is what I had hoped for given the title."
135,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/750659-don,4,"A collection of previously published essays from Oliver Sacks, who passed away last year. The book has Sacks discussing various realms of science, all in attempts to provide meaning and understanding to our inherent thirst for meaning in our lives, and understanding what we identify as our consciousness. The essays are beautifully written, thought-provoking, and often illuminating. Whether he is writing on Darwin's work with plants, how we define and measure time, or the accuracy of both or real and imagined memories, I found myself deeply engaged in Sacks' writing.In the title essay, Sacks refers to consciousness as being both ""active"" and ""selective."" Personally, my reflection on that wording and concept has given me, I think, a much better sense of understanding (even if I can't yet put it in the right words), what consciousness is, and how it is both universal and subjective.When Sacks passed away last year, I was saddened; having been touched by his prior writings on meaning, and finding particular guidance in his writings on those with mental ailments. Reading this reminds me that with his passing, we will no longer have his insightful thinking and writing to help us navigate an increasingly complex world seemingly devoid of the meaning and consciousness we so often seek and desire."
136,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44611195-lauren-butcher,4,"Dr Sacks is one of my heroes. Curious, fair, compassionate and intelligent and a beautiful writer.This last book of his contains some thoroughly readable, short essays concerning his various interests outside the field of neurology (though he also writes on the subject in here). He tackles art, music, literature. evolutionary biology, psychology and botany, to name a few, and he writes about them all with contagious enthusiasm and wonder.I would recommend anyone read Oliver Sacks. His work can be a source of great consolation, comfort and wonder in the experience of being human. Here is a great excerpt from his article on the subject of borrowing in the act of creativity:""All of us, to some extent, borrow from others, from the culture around us. Ideas are in the air, and we may appropriate, often without realizing the phrases and languages of the times. We borrow language itself; we did not invent it. We found it, we grew up into it, though we may use it, interpret, in very individual ways. What is at issue is not the fact of ""borrowing"" or ""imitating, of being ""derivative"", being ""influenced"", but what one does with what is borrowed or imitated or derived; how deeply one assimilates it takes it into oneself, compounds it with one's own experiences and thoughts and feelings, places it in relation to oneself and expresses it in a new way, one's own."""
137,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,5,"Although I haven't liked some of Sacks's books as much as I've liked others, in general, I'm a big fan and this relatively short book (217 pages) delivers. From the first chapter, ""Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers,"" to ""The Other Road: Freud as Neurologist,"" Sacks explains the views of great men (sadly, they are almost all men) in science with clarity and sympathy. It's easy to be snarky about Freud, but Sacks is not.I also loved his chapters on the fallibility of memory and mishearings. ""The River of Consciousness"" was a less successful chapter for me. The leap from neuroscience to explaining consciousness seems as mysterious as ever. But the final chapter, ""Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science,"" is a brilliant analysis of how, and sometimes why, great discoveries are made prematurely, and then often forgotten, sometimes for centuries, until our theories can incorporate them.Anyone interested in science, the history of science, and psychology will (or should) love this book. Yes, there's some overlap with Sacks' earlier books (there always is), but there's plenty of new stuff and his writing in this posthumous book is as luminous as ever."

What a model of lucidity--in the face of terminal cancer., a metastasis of melanomia of the eye that spread to his liver and claimed the life of one amazing explorer and simplifier of complex ideas worth exploring. This book was published posthumously, and one can only hope that there are other essays and writings that will come out. This lovely description of his writings was part of his obituary: neurological conditions were for him “eloquent meditations on consciousness and the human condition. The breadth of these essays that delve into everything from migraines to our brain's 'relative speed' owing to effects of dopamine and Tourettes to how shockingly many scientific discoveries we attribute to a given scientist were actually 'made' but did not take because conditions were not right; they may have predated the era in which conditions were ideal for them to take hold. Many of the books he authored are referred to here, and I look forward to delving into those that I haven't read like Migraine and a book about Oaxaca. This book, for me, defines 'good read.'"

Especially on how each chapters/subjects can connect to one another to define human consciousness on a neurological point of view. This is my first Oliver Sacks book but sadly it wasn't an inspiring reading experience. I went through the chapters feeding myself with new ideas but sometimes they seem repetitive and they lack guidance to a conclusion. I skimmed a lot because I was trying to understand the bigger picture behind all the details. But then, I appreciate how he gives his reader the freedom to conclude the meaning of these observations and find the connection ourselves. My fav chapter has to be the last one on the scotoma of scientific studies. It illuminates me on our epistemological world view. Often times we think whatever popular in science right now has to be justified as truth/superior than its predecessors, when not necessarily so. What is true anyway? we all gonna die. "

He's also clear about giving credit for ""breakthroughs"" and how many who are tagged as geniuses are often drawing on ideas or work from long ago that somehow went lost or less noticed.Flowers, evolution, plants and worms, chemistry, neuroscience, memory, mishearings, creatvity, the power of disorder, scotoma (dark places of forgetting/neglect), and the river of consciousness (discrete beads or a flow?), his own illnesses and idiosyncracies - so much territory to Sacks' work and life.His great gift was to be able to see and forge connections between people and ideas, between disciplines and to foster those connections as a doctor and teacher and writer.What a fine long life well-lived."
141,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19922653-andrew-marshall,3,"It is inspiring that two weeks before his death,Neurologist Oliver Sacks was planning his last book. How wonderful to still have something to say. I was hoping for an insight into what it might be like to stand between this world and who know what. However, River of Consciousness is a collection of essays pulling together essays on evolution, botany, neuroscience, and creativity. I assume that they had already been written for various publications and pulled together by Sacks for this book.The combination of a scientific overview and personal anecdote is very appealing and I found Sacks a great companion. As I am currently writing a book about infidelity, I was particularly fascinated by essay on the fallibility of memory. When there is often a debate on whether the person who was unfaithful should be able to remember some detail or not. With my study of Vedanta - a Hindu idea that all animals, plants are one being - I was moved to discover that humans are not just descended from apes and other animals but plants too. In fact, 70 per cent of our DNA is shared."
142,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,3,"“Two weeks before his death, Oliver Sacks outlined the contents of “The River of Consciousness”, the last book he would oversee.” Many may see this as quite a cynical and desperate ploy to squeeze one more book out of the recently departed man. Remember the very slim, but well written “Gratitude” has already been published posthumously, as have some of his interviews and a book containing a foreword by him, but this is all par for the course.So let’s be honest this is no great or essential addition to Sacks’ impressive body of work. There are plenty of retrospective and biographical accounts from Sacks, about him and his work, many which have been covered elsewhere. There are ten essays here, and it starts off a little sluggish with the opening essay on Darwin, but Sacks soon springs to life with the second one, “Time”. This falls somewhere deliciously between Huxley and Hawking and recalls Sacks at his best. Elsewhere he explores Freud and in particular his earlier, and largely overlooked work as a neurologist, he also delves heavily into his own studies and experiences, relating a whole number of neurological disorders, fascinating and scary subjects, like the creation of false memories, as he concludes at one point, “All of us transfer experiences to some extent, and at times we are not sure whether an experience was something we were told or read about, even dreamed about, or something that actually happened to us. This is especially apt to happen with one’s so called earliest memories.” So this is a mixed bag, which is not really surprising. Almost all of these theories, memories and cases have appeared in previous works by Sacks. It occasionally lacks flow and coherence. In saying that there is much to enjoy in here, and although far from essential reading, I would say that this makes for an ideal introduction into the man and is certainly a worthwhile read."
143,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12407639-bob-walenski,5,"It's difficult to even think of rating this book less than a 5*, even though it's deep and not an 'easy' read. It is quite clear though, and despite the complexity and depth of subject matter, full of insights into many mental conditions and phenomena. Sacks talks about things like the way time can seem to ""stand still"" or speed up. He delves into false memory and is particularly informative about Parkinson's and Tourettes.  My father died of complications due to Parkinson's and this was the first time I read explanations of what he may have experienced and felt with the condition. False memories have also affected my life, not in the usual benign way, but in a more personal and hurtful way. Sacks explains how and why these kinds of things can happen, and DO happen with frequency. The book was brilliant. It's not a story, other than a story about cognitive science perhaps, but was a thrilling read and helped me to learn a lot!"
144,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3691534-moayad-taibah,4,"Oliver Sacks was a genius when it came to writing and I think it came largely due his sense of empathy and human connection.River of consciousness is a series of articles discussing a variety of subjects from evolution to the growth of neuroscience. I liked the article on creativity and the river of consciousness the best, but you can’t help by mimic the author’s enthusiasm that oozes out of each and every article.It was definitely a tough read though not just cause of the subject at hand and how deep Oliver digs into it (although it is a factor) but also because how heavy and philosophical each article is; I often had to pause and think about what I just read and contemplate it.It took me quite sometime to finish this book but I didn’t feel hampered by 95% of it and would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a sense of scientific discovery, self reflection and a person who enjoys an author who has a good command of the English language and gives you the feeling of talking to someone who is really passionate about his message."
145,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"Oliver Sacks is my second favorite popular science writer after Stephen J. Gould. Sacks' essays show the playful wandering of a curious mind in ways that make science fascinating and easily accessible to laypeople. It is the kind of writing that can captivate young people and inspire them to dedicate themselves to lives in science and can even inspire someone not so young like me to want to explore more and study science in a serious way. Here Sacks discusses the nature of consciousness and perception in a series of essays in ways that are a bit different from other books that I have read in the same general area, exploring, among other things the nature of our perception of time and motion and ways in which differences in our perceptions affect our interactions with our environment. It's an easy quick read, but doesn't feel like it is dumbing down or trivializing the material. Very few writers can manage that."
146,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113039808-leonie-nicks,4,"I always love an Oliver Sacks book. This one felt a little like it didn't quite come together or that it was building up to something it never quite arrived at. It maybe started out as an exploration of consciousness and finished up as a commentary on how science progresses. I still found it fascinating nonetheless, and really enjoyed little titbits of insight that it provided. In particular, how ideas develop and grow over time, drawing from previous knowledge and sometimes disappearing into the background if that particular moment in time was not culturally ready for it only to resurface eventually. It makes you wonder what we believe to be true today and what we're not believing in because we're not culturally ready for it. Plus, the general reminder that everything we experience is so amazingly filtered, interpreted and distorted by our own world views, memory and attention that we truly all experience the world uniquely. Fascinating."

If an idea comes along before people have a conceptual framework in which to place it, it gets shelved. If an idea comes along that contradicts the ruling orthodoxy or the reigning high priest of science in a given age, it is stuffed away in a dust corner. Big scientific truths get pushed to the back of the cupboard if an influential magician can bamboozle enough people. When people write about and science innovators, inventors, and first-thinkers they often look at the icon figure rather than the real person, and they often bow to the icon without acknowledging that the ""genius"" was part of a community of thinkers.Lots of interesting stuff in a small book."
148,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2075717-robert-b,4,"This collection pulls together ten essays by Sacks, the majority published previously in the New York Review of Books. Their range is impressive – the mental perception of time and speed, the mental lives of plants and worms, the fallibility of memory, and instances of significant scientific discoveries that were underappreciated or entirely ignored in their time. The quality is uneven, as might be expected, and the best are quite good. His examination of Darwin’s often overlooked interest in plants, his thoughts on Freud as a neuroscientist, and his speculations on the history of science are fascinating. Several of the essays are more technical than are Sacks’s usual writings, and the book may be challenging to some readers. Nevertheless, the essays are a wonderful reminder of Sacks’s joyful brilliance and immense curiosity."
149,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6344283-suze,4,"This was a challenging collection of essays, probably out of my depth, but I’ve always been fascinated by the workings of the mind. Sacks brilliantly cruises through the mental lives of plants and worms, earlier scientific discoveries that were “premature” because the world zeitgeist was not ready, and the brain’s problem-solving ability while in a semi-conscious state. But I was most intrigued by his essays that deal with memory – how we continually reconstruct memories through imagination, or how some memories may never have happened or happened to someone else. ""Our only truth is narrative truth, the stories we tell each other and ourselves – the stories we continually re-categorize and refine.” (p.121) Despite all the footnotes and studies quoted, his abundance of anecdotal evidence was the most engaging for me. "
150,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16616412-nandita-damaraju,4,"I love reading Oliver Sacks and reading about Oliver Sacks. I first got to know about Oliver Sacks in Insomniac City, by Billy Hayes, where he paints a vivid portrait of the kind of man Oliver Sacks was. I then read his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, which had a wonderful empathetic tone towards people with peculiar abilities and disabilities. I really admire that empathetic, understanding manner in which he describes his patients. Even apparently negative phenomena such as plagiarism and scotoma were explained in a positive light in this book, from a neurological perspective. This book is a little bit of everything, from Darwin, to photography, plagiarism, scotoma, excerpts of his books interspersed with deeply personal anecdotes about his struggle with cancer and more. I’d recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Sacks. I’d probably rate it a 3.5/5."
151,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8077845-simon-fletcher,3,"I've loved Sacks' writing ever since I first read 'Awakenings'. He is for me the benchmark by which all writers of narrative medicine are judged. So it's with a sense of sadness that I read this, the last book he wrote before his death in 2015. Unlike many of his other books, which have a central theme which ties what are often disparate and wide ranging thoughts together, this book lacks that and suffers accordingly. The River of Consciousness is more a small collection of addenda to his other books. So here we get further thoughts on 'A Leg to Stand On', 'Migraine', 'The Island of the Colour Blind', 'Hallucinations' and of course 'Awakenings'. Each chapter is interesting in its own way, though a couple of them do drag on a little at times.This will not go down as one of Sacks' best books but it's still a must read for anyone who's read any of his other books."
152,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9361598-julie,2,"It's not a pop-science book, it's more of a ""Thoughts"" or ""Contemplation"" kind. It's a collection of essays about wonders of life, nature, people and ways of science seen by a neurophysiologist. If you are on the same page with the author, if you have enough ground to feel at ease with the topic, if you share similar interests and wonder about similar ideas — and if you read them one essay at a time, giving yourself time to reflect, then, I guess, you will find those essays engaging, thought-provoking and overall interesting to meditate on. If you are not, you will find the lack of clarity, thesis, structure and memorable images. It reads as it states, like a river of thoughts or a relaxed conversation you cannot engage in. I found it hard to grasp the picture sketched by the author and the line of his reasoning—if there was any intended."
153,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20162510-nancy-butts,4,"I have been eagerly awaiting this posthumous collection of essays from my favorite writer, Oliver Sacks; he could write a grocery list and I would enjoy reading it. That being said, this collection was a bit of a letdown. Although overall the book did feel like a happy reunion with the Sacks I remember, some of the essays seemed to lack his characteristic energy and his distinctive perspective on the world. [I’m thinking primarily of the first essay in the book.] Still, I enjoyed reading it and as always I feel inspired to embrace life with as much passion and generosity and wonder and enthusiasm as Sacks did. I am sad that he is no longer with us and that this is his last book. It was too short, and even though he lived to his 80s, his life was too short as well. "
154,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47833168-patrick,5,"Best read of the year. Sacks always presents interesting studies and cases of psychological and physiological subjects; often combined.The River of Consciousness is a posthumous collection of essays that Sacks organized before his death. Each essay is a gem, each essay covers multidisciplinary studies in a somewhat historical presentation.I cannot even express the wonder of this book. It lays at the far edge of my intellect. I feel that I developed a better understanding of the development of ideas and understanding as well as the variety of mental and physical defects. Including my own.The last essay in particular taught me why sometimes an idea ahead of its time is forgotten.A wonderful book."
155,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"This is more of a series of essays than a book on a specific topic, and Sacks covers a lot of ground, including Freud, evolution, sentience, and more, showcasing his wide-ranging mind in this slim volume. In contrast to a lot of Sacks' earlier works, these essays are more abstract and contend with larger theoretical and philosophical issues across many different disciplines, as opposed to focusing on specific case histories. As with any essay collection, this one is a bit of a mixed bag, and readers will no doubt find themselves preferring some chapters over others. I'm not sure if this is essential Sacks' reading, but it is a lovely posthumous publication by (and in a way, a tribute to) one of the most influential modern neurologists."

This is definitely one of those books. Oliver Sacks is a genius and scientist in his own right and here he writes about the many others from fields of study across the board, from neuroscience, botany, chemistry, as well as the arts. What a fantastic compilation of ideas and discoveries. While, I will admit some of it was very much beyond me, I enjoyed reading it. Perhaps enjoyed is the wrong word, appreciated fits closer. If you can appreciate the science of discovery, are intrigued by theory, wanting to read something that can bring the many branches of science together, this is for you. A relatively short book, but immense in thought and cogitation."
157,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75958279-steele-wotkyns,4,"The lead essay reveals something about Charles Darwin I never knew, another scientific field in which he also worked. It turns out all the essays in this approachable, intriguing book plumbed new levels for this reader, and I'm a lifelong fan of the history of science. The essay on speed echoes some of my own experience, with wonderful, thought-provoking impacts. Oliver Sacks had a marvelous way of looking at things: close up, from a distance and in penetrating different time scales. The River of Consciousness is just a fascinating collection of essays that both stand alone and weave together and is particularly good as an I-didn't-know-that topical exploration of the history of science offering new insights into notable scientists."
158,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,5,"Sacks was a master of packing stuff into the short form, and my favorite books of his, like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, do just that. This collection shows just what a void his death has left, as he was such a public figure for curiosity and continuous learning. In fact, there seems to be an underlying thread here of virtues Sacks embodied. His essays that examine the fuller work of both Darwin and Freud emphasize his own broad range of interests, and his final essay that examines why scientific ideas need sometimes to be forgotten in order to become canon shows some wonderful insight into the progression of thought and upending old forms of thinking. As usual, you can also expect Sacks’ love of his subject matter, research, and personal experience to all come into play."

The reader is invited to join Sacks as he contemplates, is his final months, life's rapid flow, our capacities and limitations as conscious creatures and the humorous consequences of failing hearing. Given that Sacks's humanity and scientific concerns are always intertwined, he closes this collection with one of the most humane treatments of the philosophy of science progress ever written. I laughed out loud here and welled up a bit there all while thoroughly enjoyed every last moment with this undeniably brilliant and generous intellect. Beyond highly recommended."

Each chapter discusses a different specific subject, with the “river of consciousness” being just one of the many topics included. I sort of liked this book. Some of the topics interested me to a degree, but none of them made me particularly curious. Some of the ideas Sacks mentioned I already knew, which made parts of the book rather boring to me. Some parts felt like it was just dragging along, with no real revelations being shared. On the other hand, I also think this was a good simple and basic book for explaining some interesting concepts, which may make this book a “worth it” read for some people."

He is entertaining, erudite, clear. I really liked the ""Meaning of Flowers"" which recounted Darwin's studies and others, ""Speed,"" ""The Fallibility of Memory"" and ""Mishearings"" had a charming tale of hearing ""I'm off to choir practice"" rather than the actual ""I'm off to the chiropractor."" Oh yes, the mentality of worms and plants was eye opening, too. Learned some new words to put to use: auxins and myoclonic. What a loss that Dr. sacks dies a few years ago - yet what a legacy he left. The ripples are still moving. "

I appreciated how Sacks was able to tackle many different topics, though this did make it feel a bit scattered at times. But I did appreciate it for what it was, a collection of essays, and I do think that there are themes to be found throughout. My favorite part of the book was probably towards the beginning when Sacks discusses the lives of flowers and Darwin's adaptation. Once again, he reminds us that we are all connected, and that our social lives may not really be as different as those of flowers who are just trying to find the light and adapt to changes overtime."

He adroitly connects the dots even where we didn’t by searching through ancient texts to find early truths that were either forgotten or rejected (some for a thousand years) because they were discovered before the common consciousness was ready them (he searched for three years before he came upon the writings of a physician working with amputees during the Civil War that described the phenomena of phantom limbs). Read this and watch the streams of consciousness become the River!"

He was two weeks away from death when he decided what essays would be in this book, so I read it as a culmination of his life's work and of the questions he still hadn't answered. He's a remarkably humble writer, and he shows such love and respect for his subjects (both theoretical and human) that I ended up feeling awe where he felt awe and feeling joy where he felt joy. Even when the subjects went over my head, which happened a lot.My favorite essays were ""The Creative Self"" and ""Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science""."

Clear writing, loaded with interesting information and challenging assumptions, I started learning from the first page. My favorite was about creativity, where Sacks shows the intersection of science and the arts. It is clear to me that he loved writing as much as any of his other work, and he did it well. These essays are funny, bright, enthusiastic, poignant, thoughtful, and well-crafted. I really enjoyed this book."

I especially liked the one on Sentience: The Mental Lives of Plants and Worms. I was less interested in those like The Other Road: Freud as Neurologist which seemed more of specialist historical interest, or some of his anecdotes that seemed tangential, but perhaps that's because most of them were repeated from earlier works, so if you are new to Sacks, you might still like them as anecdotes. "
167,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11985569-robert-schwab,3,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I had expected. This is Sacks' final book, assembled after his death, and reflecting his musings on the mind, which he had made his life's work. At times, it is engrossing, at others not so much. Throughout, it is well-written and represents his deep fascination with everything. He was a renaissance man, worthy of our reading time, with much to teach us. In this volume, he pays tribute to Bernard Darwin and William James, both of whom influenced his thinking. It is useful to go back to these two giants, or to be introduced to them, but I think this might be a difficult introduction to them, or to Sacks himself. "
168,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/911200-tanya,4,"This isn't exactly a cohesive whole, and yet in the pieces you can see the brain of a brilliant thinker, proficient writer and thoughtful scientist trying to put together an autobiography of his career or a road map, or a guide to the future students he will never have the opportunity to teach. The final chapter ""Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science"" blew my mind. I can imagine using it in lots of intellectual communities to think together about what we think, how it impacts what we see, and more importantly, what we might be unable to see. This book made me miss Oliver Sacks profoundly."

That could be because it was outlined by him two weeks before his death. It is comprised of several essays that varied for me in terms of holding my interest. I enjoyed the Mental Life of Plants and Worms, but not so much on Freud as the Neurologist (which I didn’t know). It is not a bad read, but it lacked the essence of Oliver in some critical fashion.

I first got to know about Oliver Sacks in Insomniac City, by Billy Hayes, where he paints a vivid portrait of the kind of man Oliver Sacks was. I then read his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, which had a wonderful empathetic tone towards people with peculiar abilities and disabilities. I really admire that empathetic, understanding manner in which he describes his patients. Even apparently negative phenomena such as plagiarism and scotoma were explained in a positive light in this book, from a neurological perspective. This book is a little bit of everything, from Darwin, to photography, plagiarism, scotoma, excerpts of his books interspersed with deeply personal anecdotes about his struggle with cancer and more.

Unlike many of his other books, which have a central theme which ties what are often disparate and wide ranging thoughts together, this book lacks that and suffers accordingly. The River of Consciousness is more a small collection of addenda to his other books.

That being said, this collection was a bit of a letdown. Although overall the book did feel like a happy reunion with the Sacks I remember, some of the essays seemed to lack his characteristic energy and his distinctive perspective on the world. [I’m thinking primarily of the first essay in the book.] Still, I enjoyed reading it and as always I feel inspired to embrace life with as much passion and generosity and wonder and enthusiasm as Sacks did. I am sad that he is no longer with us and that this is his last book. It was too short, and even though he lived to his 80s, his life was too short as well. "
184,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47833168-patrick,5,"Best read of the year. Sacks always presents interesting studies and cases of psychological and physiological subjects; often combined.The River of Consciousness is a posthumous collection of essays that Sacks organized before his death. Each essay is a gem, each essay covers multidisciplinary studies in a somewhat historical presentation.I cannot even express the wonder of this book. It lays at the far edge of my intellect. I feel that I developed a better understanding of the development of ideas and understanding as well as the variety of mental and physical defects. Including my own.The last essay in particular taught me why sometimes an idea ahead of its time is forgotten.A wonderful book."
185,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"This is more of a series of essays than a book on a specific topic, and Sacks covers a lot of ground, including Freud, evolution, sentience, and more, showcasing his wide-ranging mind in this slim volume. In contrast to a lot of Sacks' earlier works, these essays are more abstract and contend with larger theoretical and philosophical issues across many different disciplines, as opposed to focusing on specific case histories. As with any essay collection, this one is a bit of a mixed bag, and readers will no doubt find themselves preferring some chapters over others. I'm not sure if this is essential Sacks' reading, but it is a lovely posthumous publication by (and in a way, a tribute to) one of the most influential modern neurologists."
186,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18083001-teri-stich,5,"Every so often I feel the need to stretch my mind, to read something that causes pause and contemplation. This is definitely one of those books. Oliver Sacks is a genius and scientist in his own right and here he writes about the many others from fields of study across the board, from neuroscience, botany, chemistry, as well as the arts. What a fantastic compilation of ideas and discoveries. While, I will admit some of it was very much beyond me, I enjoyed reading it. Perhaps enjoyed is the wrong word, appreciated fits closer. If you can appreciate the science of discovery, are intrigued by theory, wanting to read something that can bring the many branches of science together, this is for you. A relatively short book, but immense in thought and cogitation."
187,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75958279-steele-wotkyns,4,"The lead essay reveals something about Charles Darwin I never knew, another scientific field in which he also worked. It turns out all the essays in this approachable, intriguing book plumbed new levels for this reader, and I'm a lifelong fan of the history of science. The essay on speed echoes some of my own experience, with wonderful, thought-provoking impacts. Oliver Sacks had a marvelous way of looking at things: close up, from a distance and in penetrating different time scales. The River of Consciousness is just a fascinating collection of essays that both stand alone and weave together and is particularly good as an I-didn't-know-that topical exploration of the history of science offering new insights into notable scientists."
188,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,5,"Sacks was a master of packing stuff into the short form, and my favorite books of his, like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, do just that. This collection shows just what a void his death has left, as he was such a public figure for curiosity and continuous learning. In fact, there seems to be an underlying thread here of virtues Sacks embodied. His essays that examine the fuller work of both Darwin and Freud emphasize his own broad range of interests, and his final essay that examines why scientific ideas need sometimes to be forgotten in order to become canon shows some wonderful insight into the progression of thought and upending old forms of thinking. As usual, you can also expect Sacks’ love of his subject matter, research, and personal experience to all come into play."

The reader is invited to join Sacks as he contemplates, is his final months, life's rapid flow, our capacities and limitations as conscious creatures and the humorous consequences of failing hearing. Given that Sacks's humanity and scientific concerns are always intertwined, he closes this collection with one of the most humane treatments of the philosophy of science progress ever written. I laughed out loud here and welled up a bit there all while thoroughly enjoyed every last moment with this undeniably brilliant and generous intellect. Beyond highly recommended."
190,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106999251-c-reads-books,3,"The River of Consciousness by Oliver Sacks is a collection of essays that delves into topics including evolution, creativity, memory, time, consciousness, and experience. Each chapter discusses a different specific subject, with the “river of consciousness” being just one of the many topics included. I sort of liked this book. Some of the topics interested me to a degree, but none of them made me particularly curious. Some of the ideas Sacks mentioned I already knew, which made parts of the book rather boring to me. Some parts felt like it was just dragging along, with no real revelations being shared. On the other hand, I also think this was a good simple and basic book for explaining some interesting concepts, which may make this book a “worth it” read for some people."
191,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33631523-maryanne-friend,4,"Confession: I skipped around in this book and didn't read every chapter even though it is slim and quick and he's an excellent writer. He is entertaining, erudite, clear. I really liked the ""Meaning of Flowers"" which recounted Darwin's studies and others, ""Speed,"" ""The Fallibility of Memory"" and ""Mishearings"" had a charming tale of hearing ""I'm off to choir practice"" rather than the actual ""I'm off to the chiropractor."" Oh yes, the mentality of worms and plants was eye opening, too. Learned some new words to put to use: auxins and myoclonic. What a loss that Dr. sacks dies a few years ago - yet what a legacy he left. The ripples are still moving. "
192,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13494613-annabella-sherman,4,"Gives you a lot to think about. I appreciated how Sacks was able to tackle many different topics, though this did make it feel a bit scattered at times. But I did appreciate it for what it was, a collection of essays, and I do think that there are themes to be found throughout. My favorite part of the book was probably towards the beginning when Sacks discusses the lives of flowers and Darwin's adaptation. Once again, he reminds us that we are all connected, and that our social lives may not really be as different as those of flowers who are just trying to find the light and adapt to changes overtime."
193,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18019409-michael-decamp,5,"A delightful and vigorous Educational read.OWS’s mind is wonderfully prepared for this, his final romp through the quirky histories of Evolution, Science, and Medicine. He adroitly connects the dots even where we didn’t by searching through ancient texts to find early truths that were either forgotten or rejected (some for a thousand years) because they were discovered before the common consciousness was ready them (he searched for three years before he came upon the writings of a physician working with amputees during the Civil War that described the phenomena of phantom limbs). Read this and watch the streams of consciousness become the River!"
194,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3501284-alyssa,5,"Maybe it was wrong to begin reading Oliver Sacks with the last essay collection he ever put together. But it felt kind of appropriate. He was two weeks away from death when he decided what essays would be in this book, so I read it as a culmination of his life's work and of the questions he still hadn't answered. He's a remarkably humble writer, and he shows such love and respect for his subjects (both theoretical and human) that I ended up feeling awe where he felt awe and feeling joy where he felt joy. Even when the subjects went over my head, which happened a lot.My favorite essays were ""The Creative Self"" and ""Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science""."
195,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651375-jamie-burgess,4,"I had never read any of Sacks' work before, which might be why I was so blown away by this book of essays, but I was sold when I saw that the first one was about Darwin, and it didn't disappoint. Clear writing, loaded with interesting information and challenging assumptions, I started learning from the first page. My favorite was about creativity, where Sacks shows the intersection of science and the arts. It is clear to me that he loved writing as much as any of his other work, and he did it well. These essays are funny, bright, enthusiastic, poignant, thoughtful, and well-crafted. I really enjoyed this book."
196,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42309081-eric-lawton,4,"Almost as good as his other books, with some genuinely new observations on the nature of consciousness (at least to me, and I have read a lot on the subject).Some chapters are brilliant. I especially liked the one on Sentience: The Mental Lives of Plants and Worms. I was less interested in those like The Other Road: Freud as Neurologist which seemed more of specialist historical interest, or some of his anecdotes that seemed tangential, but perhaps that's because most of them were repeated from earlier works, so if you are new to Sacks, you might still like them as anecdotes. "
197,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11985569-robert-schwab,3,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I had expected. This is Sacks' final book, assembled after his death, and reflecting his musings on the mind, which he had made his life's work. At times, it is engrossing, at others not so much. Throughout, it is well-written and represents his deep fascination with everything. He was a renaissance man, worthy of our reading time, with much to teach us. In this volume, he pays tribute to Bernard Darwin and William James, both of whom influenced his thinking. It is useful to go back to these two giants, or to be introduced to them, but I think this might be a difficult introduction to them, or to Sacks himself. "
198,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/911200-tanya,4,"This isn't exactly a cohesive whole, and yet in the pieces you can see the brain of a brilliant thinker, proficient writer and thoughtful scientist trying to put together an autobiography of his career or a road map, or a guide to the future students he will never have the opportunity to teach. The final chapter ""Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science"" blew my mind. I can imagine using it in lots of intellectual communities to think together about what we think, how it impacts what we see, and more importantly, what we might be unable to see. This book made me miss Oliver Sacks profoundly."

That could be because it was outlined by him two weeks before his death. It is comprised of several essays that varied for me in terms of holding my interest. I enjoyed the Mental Life of Plants and Worms, but not so much on Freud as the Neurologist (which I didn’t know). It is not a bad read, but it lacked the essence of Oliver in some critical fashion. Still, worth a read and it does not tax one from a time perspective. "

My favorite part of the book was probably towards the beginning when Sacks discusses the lives of flowers and Darwin's adaptation.

He was two weeks away from death when he decided what essays would be in this book, so I read it as a culmination of his life's work and of the questions he still hadn't answered. He's a remarkably humble writer, and he shows such love and respect for his subjects (both theoretical and human) that I ended up feeling awe where he felt awe and feeling joy where he felt joy.

Clear writing, loaded with interesting information and challenging assumptions, I started learning from the first page. My favorite was about creativity, where Sacks shows the intersection of science and the arts. It is clear to me that he loved writing as much as any of his other work, and he did it well. These essays are funny, bright, enthusiastic, poignant, thoughtful, and well-crafted. I really enjoyed this book."
226,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42309081-eric-lawton,4,"Almost as good as his other books, with some genuinely new observations on the nature of consciousness (at least to me, and I have read a lot on the subject).Some chapters are brilliant. I especially liked the one on Sentience: The Mental Lives of Plants and Worms. I was less interested in those like The Other Road: Freud as Neurologist which seemed more of specialist historical interest, or some of his anecdotes that seemed tangential, but perhaps that's because most of them were repeated from earlier works, so if you are new to Sacks, you might still like them as anecdotes. "
227,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11985569-robert-schwab,3,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I had expected. This is Sacks' final book, assembled after his death, and reflecting his musings on the mind, which he had made his life's work. At times, it is engrossing, at others not so much. Throughout, it is well-written and represents his deep fascination with everything. He was a renaissance man, worthy of our reading time, with much to teach us. In this volume, he pays tribute to Bernard Darwin and William James, both of whom influenced his thinking. It is useful to go back to these two giants, or to be introduced to them, but I think this might be a difficult introduction to them, or to Sacks himself. "
228,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/911200-tanya,4,"This isn't exactly a cohesive whole, and yet in the pieces you can see the brain of a brilliant thinker, proficient writer and thoughtful scientist trying to put together an autobiography of his career or a road map, or a guide to the future students he will never have the opportunity to teach. The final chapter ""Scotoma: Forgetting and Neglect in Science"" blew my mind. I can imagine using it in lots of intellectual communities to think together about what we think, how it impacts what we see, and more importantly, what we might be unable to see. This book made me miss Oliver Sacks profoundly."
229,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11469337-mark,3,"While I have greatly enjoyed most of the books by Oliver Sacks that I have read, and there are quite a few, this one did not quite feel like him, but had only elements of Sacks. That could be because it was outlined by him two weeks before his death. It is comprised of several essays that varied for me in terms of holding my interest. I enjoyed the Mental Life of Plants and Worms, but not so much on Freud as the Neurologist (which I didn’t know). It is not a bad read, but it lacked the essence of Oliver in some critical fashion. Still, worth a read and it does not tax one from a time perspective. "
230,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8527372-mary-wilt,5,"You don't read these essays to ""learn about"" or get a concrete explanation (if any such thing exists) of consciousness. You read these essays because Sacks has a grasp of the flow of time down through the history of events as they have influenced great thinkers, who unfolded some mysteries of scientific discovery AND THEORY, and then explains in clear, lucid, and often beautiful prose how this hangs together in his coherent and (face it) kind and inclusive mind. And yours, as you read. Just read it. One doesn't have to be any kind of scientist or medical practitioner to enjoy this book immensely and miss the mind who wrote it for us. "
231,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67747271-amy-c,5,"The prose was incomparably elegant, the anecdotal fragments perfectly coalesced into a harmonious work of literature that proved akin to a vintage track record seamlessly playing throughout a valley of orchards. Oliver Sacks was a man of incessant curiosity, who sought to expose his world of wonder to ordinary individuals. This book, one among a vast assortment, evinces the penetrating and appreciative scrutiny of Sacks, who in his old age, albeit hard of hearing, could still relentlessly analyze the myriad abnormalities that had piqued his interest during his earlier years in enjoyably soporific ways."
232,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272092-sr,4,"I love Sacks and his writing and the examples here are wonderful but only, I think, in the context of the rest of his work and writing, the stuff that focused (mostly) on stuff in his wheelhouse. As a final collection, perhaps a not quite perfectly polished one, this is beautiful, but I kept finding stuff that annoyed me - eliding Franklin, musing about true creativity, rhapsodies on the 19th century.This collection - I'd call it beguiling rather than compelling. It's fun. It's a very, very intelligent man with eighty years of richly observed experience writing about the subjects he loves. A great way to spend a few hours."
233,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39103024-zuska,3,"Some collections of essays that have previously appeared in other places read like collections - separate pieces that have been put in the same book. This is not one of those. Though I have encountered several of these essays in other places, it was a pleasure to read them in this context. One could read the individual essays in any order, but reading them in the arranged order is a satisfying experience - there is a sense of a building conversation between and among the pieces. There were a few places where I wanted to argue on an issue or two but on the whole that kind of provoking of thought is one of the pleasures of reading Oliver Sacks. "
234,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2818982-christopher,3,"I enjoyed Sacks' deeply intricate knowledge of various human traits and abilities related to consciousness, and how various alterations to physical and mental systems can have a profound effect on human consciousness. I also like the connections he made to the natural world; it resonated with the feeling that's been growing in me as I work outside, that humanity and nature are more deeply interconnected than many of us realize. I liked his combination of scientific, philosophical, and wisdom perspectives in his writing... it reinforced for me the idea that we need the wisdom of various disciples of thought and study to fully understand a given situation or challenge."
235,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53450768-michael,3,"This was my first time reading Oliver Sacks and while I enjoyed this book a great deal I had trouble seeing any real thesis throughout. It was really just a sporadic and pretty jumbled regurgitation of popular neuroscience topics.On the micro level it is very well written, I can see the appeal in his voice--and his individual ideas are very thorough and well-supported. They are also great conversation starters.On the macro level though the book doesn't have as much purpose as you might expect."
236,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,4,"Thought-provoking, well-written essays I enjoyed reading these essays by Oliver Sacks. This is actually the first of his works I’ve read, but now I am hooked. Throughout his essays he gave tangible examples (taken from his other books) to illustrate points he makes. Each time he does this, the subject matter was so interesting that I had to make a mental note to read his other books. I recommend this book for anyone interested in consciousness or just good science writing.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
237,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8095850-nick,5,"This book was really well written. It was easy to follow and touched upon a variety of subjects that I found really interesting. However, what one shouldn't expect is a detailed account of the theories/origins of consciousness. It looks at it (briefly) from a neurological view but in essence this book is somewhat of a ""teaser trailer"" for other books (well-cited too) that go into more detail. I will definitely try to read some of the author's more popular books as well as his writing style is clear and concise! "
238,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499384-jean,2,"Being the first book I've read by Oliver Sacks, I had high hopes, as I remember when The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat was on the best seller list. This book started slowly with Darwin's evolution theory and tied it to modern neurologic discoveries in later chapters, but the foot notes were a distraction, as were the many quotes from others' work and references to his own. Seemingly a synopsis of his prior works, there were a few ""ah ha"" moments in this book, but I would venture his original works to be more engaging."
239,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24088797-kiirstin,5,"I have always enjoyed Oliver Sacks' writing, since first reading ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" in Psych 101. This book was no exception, a collection of essays from a master of the language who can make some of the most challenging ideas and concepts accessible and beautiful. His incredibly wide-ranging interests and his voracious curiosity are on fine display here. He writes with sheer joy at the complexities of the worlds around and within us, with humour and deep compassion. Recommended."
240,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16616412-nandita-damaraju,4,"I love reading Oliver Sacks and reading about Oliver Sacks. I first got to know about Oliver Sacks in Insomniac City, by Billy Hayes, where he paints a vivid portrait of the kind of man Oliver Sacks was. I then read his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, which had a wonderful empathetic tone towards people with peculiar abilities and disabilities. I really admire that empathetic, understanding manner in which he describes his patients. Even apparently negative phenomena such as plagiarism and scotoma were explained in a positive light in this book, from a neurological perspective. This book is a little bit of everything, from Darwin, to photography, plagiarism, scotoma, excerpts of his books interspersed with deeply personal anecdotes about his struggle with cancer and more. I’d recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Sacks. I’d probably rate it a 3.5/5."
241,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8077845-simon-fletcher,3,"I've loved Sacks' writing ever since I first read 'Awakenings'. He is for me the benchmark by which all writers of narrative medicine are judged. So it's with a sense of sadness that I read this, the last book he wrote before his death in 2015. Unlike many of his other books, which have a central theme which ties what are often disparate and wide ranging thoughts together, this book lacks that and suffers accordingly. The River of Consciousness is more a small collection of addenda to his other books. So here we get further thoughts on 'A Leg to Stand On', 'Migraine', 'The Island of the Colour Blind', 'Hallucinations' and of course 'Awakenings'. Each chapter is interesting in its own way, though a couple of them do drag on a little at times.This will not go down as one of Sacks' best books but it's still a must read for anyone who's read any of his other books."
242,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9361598-julie,2,"It's not a pop-science book, it's more of a ""Thoughts"" or ""Contemplation"" kind. It's a collection of essays about wonders of life, nature, people and ways of science seen by a neurophysiologist. If you are on the same page with the author, if you have enough ground to feel at ease with the topic, if you share similar interests and wonder about similar ideas — and if you read them one essay at a time, giving yourself time to reflect, then, I guess, you will find those essays engaging, thought-provoking and overall interesting to meditate on. If you are not, you will find the lack of clarity, thesis, structure and memorable images. It reads as it states, like a river of thoughts or a relaxed conversation you cannot engage in.

This book started slowly with Darwin's evolution theory and tied it to modern neurologic discoveries in later chapters, but the foot notes were a distraction, as were the many quotes from others' work and references to his own.

This book was no exception, a collection of essays from a master of the language who can make some of the most challenging ideas and concepts accessible and beautiful. His incredibly wide-ranging interests and his voracious curiosity are on fine display here. He writes with sheer joy at the complexities of the worlds around and within us, with humour and deep compassion. Recommended."
270,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16616412-nandita-damaraju,4,"I love reading Oliver Sacks and reading about Oliver Sacks. I first got to know about Oliver Sacks in Insomniac City, by Billy Hayes, where he paints a vivid portrait of the kind of man Oliver Sacks was. I then read his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, which had a wonderful empathetic tone towards people with peculiar abilities and disabilities. I really admire that empathetic, understanding manner in which he describes his patients. Even apparently negative phenomena such as plagiarism and scotoma were explained in a positive light in this book, from a neurological perspective. This book is a little bit of everything, from Darwin, to photography, plagiarism, scotoma, excerpts of his books interspersed with deeply personal anecdotes about his struggle with cancer and more. I’d recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Sacks. I’d probably rate it a 3.5/5."
271,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8077845-simon-fletcher,3,"I've loved Sacks' writing ever since I first read 'Awakenings'. He is for me the benchmark by which all writers of narrative medicine are judged. So it's with a sense of sadness that I read this, the last book he wrote before his death in 2015. Unlike many of his other books, which have a central theme which ties what are often disparate and wide ranging thoughts together, this book lacks that and suffers accordingly. The River of Consciousness is more a small collection of addenda to his other books. So here we get further thoughts on 'A Leg to Stand On', 'Migraine', 'The Island of the Colour Blind', 'Hallucinations' and of course 'Awakenings'. Each chapter is interesting in its own way, though a couple of them do drag on a little at times.This will not go down as one of Sacks' best books but it's still a must read for anyone who's read any of his other books."
272,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9361598-julie,2,"It's not a pop-science book, it's more of a ""Thoughts"" or ""Contemplation"" kind. It's a collection of essays about wonders of life, nature, people and ways of science seen by a neurophysiologist. If you are on the same page with the author, if you have enough ground to feel at ease with the topic, if you share similar interests and wonder about similar ideas — and if you read them one essay at a time, giving yourself time to reflect, then, I guess, you will find those essays engaging, thought-provoking and overall interesting to meditate on. If you are not, you will find the lack of clarity, thesis, structure and memorable images. It reads as it states, like a river of thoughts or a relaxed conversation you cannot engage in. I found it hard to grasp the picture sketched by the author and the line of his reasoning—if there was any intended."
273,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20162510-nancy-butts,4,"I have been eagerly awaiting this posthumous collection of essays from my favorite writer, Oliver Sacks; he could write a grocery list and I would enjoy reading it. That being said, this collection was a bit of a letdown. Although overall the book did feel like a happy reunion with the Sacks I remember, some of the essays seemed to lack his characteristic energy and his distinctive perspective on the world. [I’m thinking primarily of the first essay in the book.] Still, I enjoyed reading it and as always I feel inspired to embrace life with as much passion and generosity and wonder and enthusiasm as Sacks did. I am sad that he is no longer with us and that this is his last book. It was too short, and even though he lived to his 80s, his life was too short as well. "
274,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47833168-patrick,5,"Best read of the year. Sacks always presents interesting studies and cases of psychological and physiological subjects; often combined.The River of Consciousness is a posthumous collection of essays that Sacks organized before his death. Each essay is a gem, each essay covers multidisciplinary studies in a somewhat historical presentation.I cannot even express the wonder of this book. It lays at the far edge of my intellect. I feel that I developed a better understanding of the development of ideas and understanding as well as the variety of mental and physical defects. Including my own.The last essay in particular taught me why sometimes an idea ahead of its time is forgotten.A wonderful book."
275,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"This is more of a series of essays than a book on a specific topic, and Sacks covers a lot of ground, including Freud, evolution, sentience, and more, showcasing his wide-ranging mind in this slim volume. In contrast to a lot of Sacks' earlier works, these essays are more abstract and contend with larger theoretical and philosophical issues across many different disciplines, as opposed to focusing on specific case histories. As with any essay collection, this one is a bit of a mixed bag, and readers will no doubt find themselves preferring some chapters over others. I'm not sure if this is essential Sacks' reading, but it is a lovely posthumous publication by (and in a way, a tribute to) one of the most influential modern neurologists."
276,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18083001-teri-stich,5,"Every so often I feel the need to stretch my mind, to read something that causes pause and contemplation. This is definitely one of those books. Oliver Sacks is a genius and scientist in his own right and here he writes about the many others from fields of study across the board, from neuroscience, botany, chemistry, as well as the arts. What a fantastic compilation of ideas and discoveries. While, I will admit some of it was very much beyond me, I enjoyed reading it. Perhaps enjoyed is the wrong word, appreciated fits closer. If you can appreciate the science of discovery, are intrigued by theory, wanting to read something that can bring the many branches of science together, this is for you. A relatively short book, but immense in thought and cogitation."
277,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75958279-steele-wotkyns,4,"The lead essay reveals something about Charles Darwin I never knew, another scientific field in which he also worked. It turns out all the essays in this approachable, intriguing book plumbed new levels for this reader, and I'm a lifelong fan of the history of science. The essay on speed echoes some of my own experience, with wonderful, thought-provoking impacts. Oliver Sacks had a marvelous way of looking at things: close up, from a distance and in penetrating different time scales. The River of Consciousness is just a fascinating collection of essays that both stand alone and weave together and is particularly good as an I-didn't-know-that topical exploration of the history of science offering new insights into notable scientists."
278,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,5,"Sacks was a master of packing stuff into the short form, and my favorite books of his, like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, do just that. This collection shows just what a void his death has left, as he was such a public figure for curiosity and continuous learning. In fact, there seems to be an underlying thread here of virtues Sacks embodied. His essays that examine the fuller work of both Darwin and Freud emphasize his own broad range of interests, and his final essay that examines why scientific ideas need sometimes to be forgotten in order to become canon shows some wonderful insight into the progression of thought and upending old forms of thinking. As usual, you can also expect Sacks’ love of his subject matter, research, and personal experience to all come into play."
279,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060231-todd,5,"This collection of essays is imbued with all the the brilliance and good humor we have come to expect from the late Oliver Sacks. The reader is invited to join Sacks as he contemplates, is his final months, life's rapid flow, our capacities and limitations as conscious creatures and the humorous consequences of failing hearing. Given that Sacks's humanity and scientific concerns are always intertwined, he closes this collection with one of the most humane treatments of the philosophy of science progress ever written. I laughed out loud here and welled up a bit there all while thoroughly enjoyed every last moment with this undeniably brilliant and generous intellect. Beyond highly recommended."

Each chapter discusses a different specific subject, with the “river of consciousness” being just one of the many topics included. I sort of liked this book. Some of the topics interested me to a degree, but none of them made me particularly curious. Some of the ideas Sacks mentioned I already knew, which made parts of the book rather boring to me. Some parts felt like it was just dragging along, with no real revelations being shared. On the other hand, I also think this was a good simple and basic book for explaining some interesting concepts, which may make this book a “worth it” read for some people."
281,0385352565,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33631523-maryanne-friend,4,"Confession: I skipped around in this book and didn't read every chapter even though it is slim and quick and he's an excellent writer. He is entertaining, erudite, clear. I really liked the ""Meaning of Flowers"" which recounted Darwin's studies and others, ""Speed,"" ""The Fallibility of Memory"" and ""Mishearings"" had a charming tale of hearing ""I'm off to choir practice"" rather than the actual ""I'm off to the chiropractor."" Oh yes, the mentality of worms and plants was eye opening, too. Learned some new words to put to use: auxins and myoclonic. What a loss that Dr. sacks dies a few years ago - yet what a legacy he left. The ripples are still moving. "

I appreciated how Sacks was able to tackle many different topics, though this did make it feel a bit scattered at times. But I did appreciate it for what it was, a collection of essays, and I do think that there are themes to be found throughout. My favorite part of the book was probably towards the beginning when Sacks discusses the lives of flowers and Darwin's adaptation. Once again, he reminds us that we are all connected, and that our social lives may not really be as different as those of flowers who are just trying to find the light and adapt to changes overtime."

He adroitly connects the dots even where we didn’t by searching through ancient texts to find early truths that were either forgotten or rejected (some for a thousand years) because they were discovered before the common consciousness was ready them (he searched for three years before he came upon the writings of a physician working with amputees during the Civil War that described the phenomena of phantom limbs).

Seemingly a synopsis of his prior works, there were a few ""ah ha"" moments in this book, but I would venture his original works to be more engaging."

This book was no exception, a collection of essays from a master of the language who can make some of the most challenging ideas and concepts accessible and beautiful. His incredibly wide-ranging interests and his voracious curiosity are on fine display here. He writes with sheer joy at the complexities of the worlds around and within us, with humour and deep compassion. Recommended."
