0,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"An interesting if somewhat scattered tour through genes focusing on evolutionary proofs. Preface: Beyond Any Reasonable Doubt was too long & there is an introduction. Redundant; do one or the other. Basically he's going to make a case for evolution that proves it beyond a reasonable doubt just using DNA. No need to convince me & I doubt it will convince anyone who believes in magic, but I like the premise.Introduction: The Bloodless Fish of Bouvet Island is about the ice fish of Antarctica. Very wild adaptation & it's interesting how it came about.The Everyday Math of Evolution: Chance, Selection, and Time is excellent. I've always said that people (like my neighbors) who believe in Creationism are just bad with numbers. (Of course, they're stuck in a 6,000 year time frame, so magic is the only answer.) Anyway, he spends some time with probabilities & statistics that make sense of how changes can multiply. It's not the best explanation I've read, though. He tends to wander around too much.Immortal Genes: Running in Place for Eons were something I'd heard about, but never heard defined before. His definition was foggy, but I got the gist. A few basic processes are necessary & the genes that control them haven't changed because when they do, the life-form dies.Making the New from the Old is about genes changing over time. Really interesting example of our eyesight. We have trichromatic vision now, but many (most?) mammals don't, yet many reptiles, birds, & such do. Our common ancestor did. Apparently when mammals were little hunted things, we lived at night so color wasn't important & we became dichromatic. As we became day-dwellers, we redeveloped color perception, but in different ways. Great examples between the genetics of New & Old World monkeys.Fossil Genes: Broken Pieces of Yesterday's Life Use it or lose it, as with color vision. Genes will mutate. If they don't cause a survival issue, the broken gene just becomes more & more broken until it is a fossil. If the broken gene does cause a survival issue, then natural selection sees that it isn't passed on.Deja Vu: How and Why Evolution Repeats Itself Life adapts or dies off. How it adapts may look very similar but is often done through different mechanisms. Great examples with the specific needs of sight as compared to coloring which can be accomplished in many ways.Our Flesh and Blood: Arms Races, the Human Race, and Natural Selection Arms races between species make for fast evolution & we've seen some in our own race. Several good examples, although the malaria one didn't fully mesh with what I've read before. I was rather disappointed in the uneven description.The Making and Evolution of Complexity is about how complex structures develop out of simple ones. Again, a lot of really good info, but he never really went through the steps in a cohesive manner.Seeing and Believing held some horrific examples of where ideology overshadowed science to the detriment of all. The main example was the denial of genetics by the USSR. Along with collectivism, this led to millions starving. This is the same sort of ignorance held by many fundamentalist Protestants here in the US. Thankfully, the Catholic church has recently (finally!) recognized evolution & then there is the Clergy Letter Project, religious groups & leaders who are willing to write to school boards & such to keep religion out of science. Carroll also provides more examples of why 'intelligent design' isn't science.I had no idea chiropractors were against vaccination & such. I go to one occasionally (every 3 -5 years) to get my back cracked, generally my left sacroiliac. When it goes out, nothing makes in better until a strong chiropractor snaps it back into place. Then I have to be careful & keep a rolled up towel to brace it while sitting for a while. Definitely not a placebo effect, so I don't think they're all completely full of crap, but many scientists & doctors think so, including a couple of very good orthopedic surgeons I knew well who couldn't fix that pain. Well, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. The Palm Trees of Wyoming is a grim ending. He points out the wonderful fossils unearthed in Utah during the building of the transcontinental railroad & the sort of creatures & climate it shows. Fittest is fleeting, even precarious. He then goes on give some horrifying stats on sea life & its degradation. (Also a big horn sheep example.) It's plain scary. Even when we finally get around to protecting a species, we may well have altered the balance too much for the species or even the ecosystem to recover. One of his examples is the Chesapeake Bay. I grew up gathering crabs in a hand net tossing them into a bushel basket in an inner tube tied to my waist with a rope. Even my 7 year old self could get a respectable catch in an hour of wading through the grasses. That area, along with over a third of the bay, is now a dead zone. No crabs, no grass in less than half a century. Horrifying.This last chapter is fantastic & by far the best argument he made for evolution. Without understanding evolutionary & ecological forces, we're doing this to our entire world. It's not just one species that we hunt to extinction, but all the other parts of the ecosystem that depend on them.This book isn't going to convince anyone who doesn't believe in evolution that it does exist. Carroll's arguments were too scattered. He seems like a smart guy & I loved all the neat facts, but he rarely brought them together properly. Still, it was quite interesting especially when put together with other books on evolution & genetics. Unseen Diversity: The World of Bacteria & Venomous: How Earth's Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry also blend well with it."
1,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4496242-sarah,5,"I read this book over the course of an entire semester of college, as it was assigned for my Ecology, Evolution & Society Biology class. That being said, I am sad to see it come to an end as this semester winds to a close as well. I had begun to look forward to the new piece of evidence or explanation for natural selection that Carroll provided with each new chapter. He presents a myriad of examples in very simplified way, so as to provide readers with an easier and more comprehensive way of understanding the mechanisms of evolution. He does so by utilizing the newest way in which scientists have begun to understand evolution and shared ancestry: through DNA.With each chapter, Carroll clearly explains the inner-workings of evolution, and presents new and interesting findings and statistics that you might have never heard of before. Upon finishing this book, you will have a new wealth of knowledge regarding the ways in which species interact with one another to foster the grand ecosystem that is the tree of life. Every organism, even the most seemingly insignificant ones, have a purpose in the world, for each organism is but a puzzle piece within the constantly changing web or organisms. The fittest is a conditional phase, and no organism is guaranteed to be at the top of the hierarchy forever. Thus, we are all in an evolutionary arm's race of sorts--I think our status as animals sharing this earth among many others who must run just as fast as us to keep up with nature, is quite beautiful, if you think about it. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in biology, evolution, Darwinism, etc. Those who are beginners in biology/people who lack a sufficient scientific background will be pleased to find that Carroll makes this understandable and interesting for the average Joe. 10/10 "
2,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,5,"Gobsmacking! From convergent evolution to fossil genes we are here taken through a breathtaking journey into the realm of evolution, with DNA's point of view as sole guide and captain.Sean B. Carroll's genocentrism is captivating, fascinating, enlightening. His writing style is engaging and very accessible. The whole is a great work absolutely impossible to put down until the last line of the last page!Brillantly, he also argues for a better recognition of evolutionary science those impact, from environmental issues to medicine cannot be underestimated. About, he's not afraid to blow away anti-evolutionary fantasies -from Lyssenko's case in the USSR to the more contemporary and burning debate around the so-called 'Intelligent Design'. Fantastic! "
3,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688502-michelle,4,"I studied evolution for the first time at age 26 in a ""first year biology for science majors"" course at Utah State University. Amazingly (at least, it seems amazing to me now, knowing how foundational evolutionary principles are to every aspect of modern biology), evolution was never even mentioned in my high school biology class, nor was it seriously touched upon in any class I took at Brigham Young University, beyond professors referring us to official Church statements on evolution (which basically boil down to ""the Church takes no official stand on the matter""). I can't blame them for their reluctance, since despite the Church's official open-mindedness on the subject, BYU faculty had received specific instruction from Boyd K. Packer, then acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, not to teach evolution at BYU. So, even though some members of BYU faculty were themselves involved in evolutionary biology research (you can't really do biology research that doesn't take into account evolutionary principles because it's such a foundational concept), they were instructed NOT to teach these principles to their students.So I went into that Utah State biology course with a lot of cultural baggage. I knew going into it that evolution would be one of the main things we'd study, and I steeled myself against believing in a scientific theory that I'd been warned (first by a well-intentioned mother when I was in the 5th grade, and strengthened by a an ardently anti-evolution Institute teacher) went against the teachings of the Bible and was incompatible with a belief in a Creator-God. Luckily, my biology professor--a great and compassionate teacher and scientist named Frank Messina--knew his audience (about half active Mormons) well enough to know that we'd need to get over that cultural hurdle before we could get excited about studying evolution. He recommended some books by LDS scientists willing to write candidly about their experiences with the intersection of science and faith (one of the best was Reflections of a Scientist by Henry Eyring). Reading those books, I considered for the first time the possibility that my faith and the study of evolution might not be incompatible. Because of that, I was able to really delve into the subject that semester and grew to really love it for all its highly nuanced simplicity. Dr. Messina taught two units that semester: evolution and ecology. It started to hit home with me how fundamental a principle evolution is when I realized how much it informed our understanding of ecology, and I eventually came to see how it underpins our understanding of everything in biology.I thoroughly enjoyed this book (The Making of the Fittest). It was dense enough reading that I ended up checking it out from the library several times because I'd have to put it down for a while and absorb before picking up again where I'd left off. It was a great review of the basics of evolutionary biology, and also taught me new things that have been discovered in the ten years since I took that college biology course. In the second-to-last chapter, the author switches gears and talks about the underpinnings of the perceived need by some to deny evolution. And in the final chapter, he gives an impassioned and convincing argument for the importance of understanding the mechanisms of evolution--not just for scientists, but for policymakers, natural resource managers, and anyone who interacts with the natural world (which, whether we realize it or not, is all of us). I highly, highly recommend this one."
4,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5905779-albert,5,"In a country where the teaching of evolutionary biology is being suppressed in the schools, and where very few people actually UNDERSTAND what evolution is, this book could not have come at a better time. It is a very engaging introduction or review of the principle of evolution, meant for laypeople who care enough to be in the know. Many might be surprised to know that what we know about evolution is not only based on the fossil record but on the ""DNA record"". In the same way we can trace paternity, DNA also bears the marks left by millions of years of evolution. So it makes no sense that the same people who put their trust in DNA tests that identify the father of a child or determine the guilt or innocence of criminals are the same folks who do NOT trust the DNA tests that give undisputable proof of the reality of evolution. The book also deals head-on with the ""anti-evolution"" sentiments, and just how such ignorance could endanger our very survival, in light of how evolutionary science has helped us fight diseases, battle cancer, insure a reliable food supply -- all the things that we take for granted in our comfortable, modern existence."
5,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178754-kate,5,"Although it tends at times to be too dry and formal for a pop-sci book, this is a well-built explanation of the genetics behind evolution, and has a lot of valuable things to say.The book's best points are definitely the scientific and historical anecdotes at the beginning of each chapter. Carroll's voice at these points becomes much more lively and engaging. When he goes to explain the science behind, say, the ""bloodless"" icefish of the South Ocean, he immediately reverts to a scholarly tone that has probably lost this book a lot of readers. I read Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo more than a year ago, and found it really hard going for a lot of the same reasons. I suspect The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution was written to explain what readers of that book were presumed to understand already. I wish now that I'd read this one, first, and might pick up Endless Forms again to see if it makes more sense this time.Overall, I really recommend The Making of the Fittest. It requires careful, active reading, but in the end I found it well worth the effort. I'll definitely be on the lookout for Carroll's other work!"
6,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,5,"Read this one years ago, and just found it on audio. I enjoyed it almost as much now as I remember doing so then. Not a ton of ground shifting information for those that have an interest in evolution and history of science, but still an important pop-sci book."
7,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72945589-illiterate,2,A good introduction to the way genomics and maths fill out and support the theory of evolution. Chapter 9 onwards is boring if well-intentioned.
8,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,5,"Carroll starts out by talking about forensic use of DNA evidence in criminal cases, where we rely on DNA evidence to determine guilt or innocence, often in cases where the death penalty or long imprisonment is at stake. He explains, in simple terms, how this works and why it matters.And then he explains the contradiction between the wide popular acceptance of DNA evidence by the general public, and the widespread resistance to or rejection of evolution.Organized in three main sections, Carroll lays out, first, how DNA analysis works, why it is solid evidence of evolution, and how it enables us to decipher the evolutionary history of organisms; what it tells us about how evolution has worked, focusing on specific examples such as the evolution of vision in insects, primates, cetaceans, and fish, and why Antarctic ice fish have no hemoglobin in their blood; and finally, the major arguments against evolution and responses to them.The book is written in clear, understandable terms. Carroll acknowledges that some of the concepts are complex, but says they're both important and within the ability of the reader to understand, and then proceeds to explain them in an accessible way without talking down to his readers. In the audio version, we don't get the benefit of seeing the figures and illustrations while listening to the text, but in the audio CD edition, they are included on the final disk. In the final section, refuting objections to evolution, Carroll is respectful and never mocks those he disagrees with, but is absolutely firm and clear about why they are wrong.Patrick Lawlor, as the reader, is excellent, with a clear, expressive voice that captures, I think, exactly the tone that Sean Carroll intended.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from a friend."
9,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999177-andy-mitchell,5,"Dr. Carroll is a well-respected biologist and a contemporary Darwin scholar.He shares his original insights and connects them to the latest research in evolutionary biology.The book will anger some conservative Christians. It will also frustrate many chiropractors, and well as the occasional Soviet communist.The tone is a bit arrogant, but the explanations of the DNA record are clear and accessible for anyone with a knowledge of high school biology and genetics.The story moves more briskly and clearly than I thought possible.If you’re interested in learning more about the evidence behind Darwinian evolution, you need to read this book. I particularly enjoyed reading about the ice fish, an animal completely free of red blood cells. You’ll find a favorite anecdote or two as well.I give it my highest recommendation!"
10,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764967-nola,2,"I liked the explanations of the various facets of evolution, of vision, especially. It was also interesting to hear what happened to plant genetics in post-World War II Russia. I didn't like the way that Carroll argued for evolution and the attacks he made on creationists. It seems to me that the facts stand on their own, and can be understood by anyone willing without being force-fed. I almost never do feel, however, that an appeal for environmentalism, as in the last chapter of this book, is misplaced, and I was horrified by the new facts there. It was especially compelling that Carrol himself says he had just found out about the statistics in the final chapter while doing the research for the book."
11,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4502867-kaa,2,"I have a hard time finding any exciting information in this book even though genetics and evolution are captivating. Most of the content is either too redundant to my knowledge, overly generalized or unnecessary specific. The problem that I see with this book is a lack of future foresight. Nowadays, everyone is familiar with evolution, it has been a hot topic for over 150 years. There is no need for another book proving this theory. On the contrary, genetics is a rapidly developing branch of biology promising many fascinating discoveries, and, yet, the author does not mention any of them. "
12,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,0,"Eh. The accessible parts of this were familiar, and I won't have access to it long enough to take a class in genetics to be able to understand the details. For once I've found a science book that actually would, imo, be improved with a bit more of a narrative. The last chapter is interesting, though...."
13,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"The purpose of the book is to explain correctness of theory of evolution using DNA analysis, understanding natural selection and the wide diversity of species. Sean B. Carroll divided entire book to three logical parts: before meal, meal (the most difficult part to understand) and dessert. Author gave a truthful evidences to DNA record in our genes and dispelled a lot of important hesitations towards evolution: why we did need evolution.It also worth to note that Carroll interesting used some historical events, which made reading interesting. Albeit it was difficult to understand 'meal' part, but it was interesting to read last chapters regarding to ignorance of theory of evolution and anthropological effect."
14,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,4,"I was hoping for more in depth science, but this was a fantastic introductory book."
15,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46092811-jennifer,3,"I think my background is skewing how I see this book. I have an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a graduate degree in cell, molecular, and developmental biology, so some of the information presented here seemed either oversimplified or obvious. I also have a legal background, and in one of my two constitutional law classes we spent a decent amount of time on the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. In particular, we learned a great deal about the intelligent design movement and the Kitzmiller v. Dover case, which is discussed (although not by name) in Chapter 9, and I would have enjoyed an expanded discussion of both the case and “irreducible complexity.” Incidentally, Michael Behe and irreducible complexity both showed up in Kitzmiller. Finally, while I accept the theory of evolution - and for people who want to plead ""it's only a theory"" I also accept the theory of gravitation, the theory of relativity, and the germ theory of disease - and an old earth, I know several young-earth creationists very well and interact with them regularly. With all that in mind, here goes…First, I appreciated the sections on the mathematics behind evolution, particularly the frequency of new mutations for natural selection to act on. This section would be especially useful when interacting with young-earth creationists, because from what I can see there is a strong belief that the idea of an old earth was postulated primarily because of the time frames required for evolution, so it was useful to see the evidence of the frequency of mutations clearly laid out. And it doesn’t take nearly as long as one might think. Yes, you’d need longer than six thousand years, but four and a half billion years is far more than enough. So, if you have to interact with young-earth creationists and they keep trying to start arguments based on statistics and probability with you, I would recommend reading this book just to get a feel for the numbers. I would not recommend giving it to them; most of them would never read a book with a title like this. However, if you read it yourself you can start bringing up math as soon as they do. One caveat about this chapter: The calculations for mutation frequency don’t explicitly include a calculation for the probability that the mutation will end up in the germ line, and thus be evolutionarily relevant. As a graduate student, I worked with two highly conserved (“immortal”) gene sequences, including the 16S sequence, so Woese and his work were familiar to me. But I do believe some more explanation should have been included here. While Woese’s work was discussed, the 16S sequence was never brought up by name or even described. I think the 16S gene should have been named and its function described, and then it would have been obvious why this gene is “immortal” and the reasons Woese selected it would have been more clear. Similarly, a conserved region of the elongation factor 1-alpha gene was shown, but there was no discussion of what elongation factor 1-alpha does or why it’s important to cells across all three domains. To me this was a recurring problem; the “why’s” that would have helped the argument were left undiscussed. The preface made it clear this was supposed to be an argument, or a “brief,” in favor of evolutionary theory, and it’s always best to discuss all the relevant information, the reasons why you cited that information, and how it helps the case you’re building. Of course, it’s also best to have a concise argument with a chain of reasoning that can be clearly linked to the “clincher” statement, which were also things I couldn’t always find. Incidentally, there are plenty of highly conserved genes to choose from for a discussion like this, and I think “The Violinist’s Thumb” did a much better job with explaining the conservation of the hox genes.Because this topic came up in the same chapter, I’ll add that I’d like to learn more about the idea of eukaryotes being the result of a “merger” between bacterial and archaean parents – this version of the tree of life was never presented, even in grad school, and I’m most familiar with the version that has bacteria and archaea splitting off and then eukaryotes splitting off from archaea. Genetic similarities in eukaryotes and archaeans are in genes that encode for enzymes associated with transcription and translation. But eukaryotes have much more in common with bacteria when it comes to genes that encode for enzymes associated with metabolic enzymes or for basic cellular components. The merger idea makes more sense, but if it were widely accepted one would think I’d have heard of it before (the book was published in 2006, when I was in grad school). In addition, the table on page 77 is making me wonder whether there is an upper limit on the number of genes in a genome; if so, it would explain why alternative splicing came to be, even though it is very costly in terms of energy.Speaking of energetic costs, another thing that drove me crazy is that a discussion of energy requirements when it comes to producing certain proteins was not included. Proteins that might otherwise confer a selective advantage can be so energetically costly to make that they fall out of the pool if the advantage is not immediately apparent. Venoms or poisons tend to be biochemically expensive, and this is one of the reasons why mimicry is such a popular tactic. Similarly, heat-resistant proteins and other cellular components tend to be very costly in terms of energy, so any advantage conferred would need to show up relatively early. In addition, it takes longer and costs more energy to transcribe a larger genome, and so reproduction also takes longer and costs more. These balancing factors were not discussed, and I felt like they should have been.Furthermore, I’m not even sure who the intended audience for the book is supposed to be. For one thing, while the 16S gene was alluded to but never named and elongation factor 1-alpha was named but never discussed, it seemed like the book was initially targeted toward readers with a casual interest in biology. But then the book brought up specific codons and included portions of protein sequences that were written using the single-letter abbreviations for each amino acid. Although I still remember a lot of biochemistry, I do not remember every single codon or the single-letter abbreviations for each amino acid, and a reader with a more casual interest would likely find it even more confusing. This problem could have been easily resolved by including an appendix with a few tables containing this information. But other parts of the book were obviously geared more towards non-specialists, such as the discussion of opsins. It’s possible to successfully achieve an “in-between” effect, but it’s very rare and usually requires including a lot of technical information somewhere in the book (usually a few appendices) and making it clear that the reader can consult those appendices for a more detailed discussion. This worked well for A Fish Caught in Time: The Search for the Coelacanth.For the interested (review continues beneath second table):The codons:

The single-letter amino acid abbreviations:

As for seeking to convince creationists by pointing out the evidence for evolution from molecular biology, I will simply point out that most creationists do not completely discount the idea that both natural selection and evolution can happen. When confronted with the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, or the pigment shifts in the peppered moth, they will say these are examples of “microevolution” and this is not the problem. It is “macroevolution” that they object to, and as far as I’ve been able to tell no amount of discussion will convince them that small changes over time can add up to very large changes. Also, pointing out the universally conserved sequences isn’t going to help much at all, because the similarities will be interpreted as evidence for design (think “we create similar tools for similar tasks.”) Under these circumstances, even very strong evidence isn’t going to help nearly as much as one might think.I did like Chapter 9, and I found the discussion of the most common arguments and tactics used to attempt to undermine scientific arguments interesting, especially because the same pattern is emerging when it comes to climate change in the United States:1.	Doubt the science (and make teaching it effectively impossible)2.	Question the motives and integrity of scientists (and bring up grant funding at every opportunity)3.	Play up legitimate disagreements among scientists, and cite gadflies as authorities (bonus points if you can find credentialed scientists outside the relevant field to take your side – creationists arguing against evolution have been known to cite arguments from “PhD scientists” whose degrees are in physics and astronomy)4.	Exaggerate potential harm5.	Appeal to personal freedom (an especially powerful tactic in the United States)6.	Argue that accepting the science means rejecting the core of another set of beliefs vital to a person, his or her community, or both (bonus points if this is religious faith or political values, which can then be linked to personal freedom)And I don't think it's a coincidence that the same group of people who oppose the idea of evolution also oppose the idea of climate change."
16,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1874626-kara,4,"For us scientists who spend our holidays explaining basic science concepts to our non-scientist relatives, this conversationally written book is chock full of some of the best examples that clearly illustrate and support the evolution by the forces of natural selection. Carroll simplifies DNA and molecular data and the mathematics of probability so that most people could have a better understanding of the principles that underpin evolution, and indeed, all of biology. As someone quite partial to vision, I was impressed with his chapters on eye evolution. Although I felt that he left out some key pieces of information, I had to keep reminding myself that he was writing for an audience that doesn't already know the difference between rhabdomeric and cilliary photoreceptors. Besides, he does include quite an extensive list of extra reading for people who want to know more about specific concepts and examples.While the bulk of Carroll's book focuses on providing a clear and well-supported lay explanation of evolution, the last two chapters set this volume apart from any other popular biology book that I've read. In the chapter entitled, ""Seeing and Believing"", Carroll chronicles several examples of ideological resistance to science: the French doctors who did not believe Pasteur's experiments on the microbe causes of many diseases; Lysenko and the soviet era of the denial of DNA as hereditary information; chiropractors and their denial of the efficacy of the Polio vaccine; and finally evolution naysayers. This chapter alone should at least convince the people who scoff at evolution to re-evaluate their position. The last chapter, ""The Palm Trees of Wyoming"" is a wake-up call for all of us. By juxtaposing the fossil record, the state of the world's oceanic fisheries (dire from all the numbers he quotes), and history of human impact on the natural world, Carroll points out that the most alarming consequence of not understanding the implications of evolution could be our own demise...after we have destroyed a multitude of ecosystems by our actions. If only we could learn the lessons of evolution by natural selection we would see how our unnatural selective pressure on many species has altered them to the point of being unable to survive.To all of my friends and fellow readers who may or may not know much about evolution or science, I highly recommend this book. I especially urge high school biology teachers to read this and consider assigning it (or a few chapters) to their classes."
17,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,3,"Eh. 2.5 stars, but I'll round up to three because it was enjoyable enough that I made it through the whole thing without getting TOO bored or annoyed.But first of all, dangit! How did I get stuck with another audiobook narrated by Patrick Lawlor? I meant to avoid him from now on after his reading of Buddy Levy's Conquistador; at least he didn't have any Spanish to butcher this time. I'm sure he's a very nice man, but I have a really hard time with his accent. I just do. However, I did actually manage to make it all the way through his reading of this book, so yay me! As to the book itself, I found it in turns pretty interesting and pretty frustrating. I really enjoyed the parts about the evolution of the eye, but most of the other examples Carroll uses I have seen documented much more thoroughly in other books, so those parts had less appeal for me. I imagine folks that haven't read or heard about them before will enjoy them much more than I did. I also felt like at times Carroll got pretty repetetive, and his habit of ending every chapter with something like, ""in the next chapter, I'll talk about so-and-so..."" really got on my nerves. I don't really need you to tell me what you're going to start talking about on the next page--just move along and talk about it already! It felt kind of...I don't know. Amateurish? I didn't like it, whatever it felt like. And then the chapter about intelligent design seemed really unnecessary to me. I get the idea that he's trying to convert people from intelligent design to believing in evolution with the power of his arguments or whatever, but (a) how many people that believe in intelligent design are really reading this in the first place? And (b) it seemed kind of disrespectful, although I do at least appreciate his making the point that not ALL people who believe in God feel that the theory of evolution is antithetical to their faith. I just feel like it would have been a much better book without that entire section.I know I sound pretty crotchety about this one, but it's not bad. I guess I do think there are better books on this topic out there though. On the other hand, plenty of folks seem to have really liked this one a lot, so maybe that's just me. "
18,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Making of the Fittest by Sean B. Carroll Fantastic! An accessible book on genetics that hits all the right notes. Music to my ears. Beyond any reasonable doubt this is one of the best books to get on evolution. DNA contains the information that decisively confirms evolution. This book contains the information that makes it clear that it is so. Positives: 1. Evolution explained for the general masses with focus on genetics. 2. Dr. Carroll uses a great approach to explain the complexities of genetics. Each of the 10 chapters begins with stating clearly what we are expected to learn from that chapter. 3. Some great examples and wonderful illustrations. 4. Great examples of evolution. 5. Some fascinating and memorable information. 6. Introduces new terms you have probably never heard, but will understand as a result of the author's innate ability to present in a clear manner. 7. Great civility used in debunking creationists misinformation on evolution. 8. Powerful and memorable arguments. Well reasoned and well thought out. 9. Covers many topics about evolution not just genetics. 10. There are many great books on evolution: ""Why Evolution is True"" by Jerry Coyne, ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" by Richard Dawkins, ""Your Inner Fish"" by Neil B. Shubin, ""What Evolution Is"" by Ernst Mayr and now ""The Making of the Fittest"" by Sean B. Carroll is also worthy of being on that top mantle of books about evolution. Negatives: 1. It's not intended for those in the field due to its basic and general approach. 2. I wanted more...more examples. In summary, a fabulous book on evolution that focuses on genetics. I can't recommend this book enough. Highly recommended to all those who want to learn about evolution but are too fearful that the topic may be way over their heads...no need to fear Dr. Carroll is here."

In the first part of the book, there is an explanation of how the book will be organized, along with a review of the basic principles of evolution and natural selection. He provides an early explanation of how mutation works, of how and why a mutation may or may not change the structure of a protein (since DNA is used to code proteins, which then build bodies and structures) and explains using very basic math how we know if a particular mutation is being acted on by natural selection or not. In the bulk of the text, Carroll gives example after example of the evolution of genes, fossilization of genes, and the independent evolution of particular traits, all of which show undeniable evidence for evolution at work. In the section marked ""after dinner discussion"" he talks about science denial, comparing modern denial of evolution to the ideological denial of genetics in Soviet Russia (leading to severe crop failures and starvation), and the early denial of the germ theory of disease by doctors who could not believe that they themselves were carrying illness from sick patients to healthy ones because they didn't wash their hands. And in the final chapter, an ecological warning about how humans have and are causing dire environmental harm by ignoring the effects of natural selection in resource management, citing multiple collapsed fisheries to show how the pattern of exploitation and collapse proceeds.All in all, very well written and informative. I look forward to reading Carroll's other books as well. "

It's always illuminating to have a working scientist write popular nonfiction, and this book is a case in point. I liked it less well when Carroll veered into politics. He didn't make any case against creationism that's going to stick, and he soiled the book in attempting it. I heard him lecture on the same topics, and both the best and worst features of this book were magnified by live presentation. The stories about how evolution works are in themselves fascinating. As to whether religious-based thinkers believe evolution or not -- who cares? There's nothing that will change their minds. They have their truth, and the facts be damned.Carroll's science writing isn't the easiest to read, but it's worth the effort. This book is easier to understand than his previous one, and perhaps not by coincidence stays further from his own academic research."

Then the focus turns to explanations of genes, genetic mutation, and their role in evolution and natural selection. The theory is supplemented by many interesting examples based on recent genome analysis, describing how some sequences have lasted since the fossil record and others have changed quite recently. The end of the book turned more ""political"" as the author argues against ""intelligent design"" (which he calls pseudo-science), and talks about issues of ""biodiversity"" such as the impact of overfishing on certain species of fish.

26,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"How DNA supports the fact of Darwinian evolutionMost of this book is a primer on how the study of DNA code from various species sheds light on the evolutionary process. The text is as clear as such a text can be considering how abstract the DNA sequences are to even the well educated reader. There are numerous charts and tables, drawings, black and white photos (and some color plates) and such in this timely, handsome and well-presented book to guide the reader. I only wish that I could have grasped the details in a more concrete manner.DNA codes for proteins, of which there are vast numbers. These proteins are formed from amino acids of which life uses twenty, and in turn these amino acids are called up by the sequence of letters in the code. Presumably (Carroll does not make this clear) as the zygotic cell divides, working its way to the composition of the complete organism, the DNA code is read in sequence like a tape fed into a bar code. First this protein and then that protein and then still another is made and somehow strung together in an exacting order so that, voila! a massively complex organism is constructed. What is not in this book is an explanation of how these proteins know where to go and when. Presumably that knowledge is part of the very sequence of the code, or perhaps it is implicit in the positions in space of the proteins relative to one another. In others words, the DNA code is only the most obvious and “visible” part of the microscopic reproductive process.If you are like me and are looking for the same sort of explanation, this book will be of limited value. Prof. Carroll’s purpose is not to make transparent the reproductive process at the chemical level. His purpose—and a laudable one it is—is to show how DNA analysis is yet another piece of evidence pointing to the truth of biological evolution. That is why he uses the word “forensic” in the subtitle.One of the most powerful uses of DNA is in reconstructing the so-called “tree” (or “bush”) of life. Carroll shows how it is now clear beyond almost any doubt that our closest relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos followed by the other great apes and then monkeys. He shows how DNA analysis can also (and by the same logic) be used to show the relative age of species. Interesting is the discovery of how exactly similar are some sections of code in diverse species, indicating that such code is very ancient. In fact Carroll points to “immortal” sequences of code that have resisted all attempts at corruption or mutation. He explains that such code is so nearly indispensible to living forms that natural selection is, and has always been, active in keeping it intact.In this regard (and moving to the latter chapters of the book) we find a particularly delightful refutation of one of the notions of “Intelligent Design.” Carroll quotes perhaps the best known of the intelligent designers, Dr. Michael Behe, as writing:“Suppose that nearly four billion years ago the designer made the first cell, already containing all of the incredibly complex biochemical systems discussed here and many others. (One can postulate that the design for systems that were to be used later, such as blood clotting, were present but not ‘turned on.’ In present-day organisms plenty of genes are turned off for a while, sometimes for generations, to be turned on at a later time).” (p. 244)How brilliant this sounds! However Carroll writes: “This is utter nonsense that disregards fundamentals of genetics. Dr. Ken Miller of Brown University has described this scenario as ‘an absolutely hopeless genetic fantasy of pre-formed genes waiting for the organisms that might need them to gradually appear.’ As we saw in chapter 5, the rule of DNA code is use it or lose it. The constant bombardment of mutation will erode the text of genes that are not used, as it has in icefish, yeast, humans, and virtually every other species. There is no mechanism for genes to be preserved while awaiting the need for them to arise.” (p. 244)Indeed, if Behe were correct, there would be in virtually all species “silent pre-formed genes” waiting to be called upon. There aren’t.In the chapter entitled “Seeing and Believing” Carroll recalls Louis Pasteur’s struggle to demonstrate to non-seeing and non-believing doctors that childbed fever was caused by their dirty hands. He reprises the horrific and bizarre story of the Soviet head of (political) biology Trofim Denisovich Lysenko who denied genetics, and how Stalin’s support of him led to massive failures in agriculture and subsequent starvation. He further recalls how Mao Zedong, using the same unscientific ideas, sponsored massive starvation in China due to crop failures.What Carroll is getting at is that political corruption of science can be very dangerous. In the United States today under the power of the Bush administration, faith-based (and corporate-sponsored) science is denying global warming and other deleterious effects of rampant pollution. This sort of science denial is likely to lead to human suffering and death, just as did the communist denial of genetics. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

28,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67945187-richard-carter,4,"I enjoyed The Making of the Fittest very much indeed. It gets into details, and requires a higher degree of concentration than many other popular science books. There's even some mathematics involved—but don't let that put you off. If you pay attention, this is a eminently readable book.The main theme of The Making of the Fittest is how modern DNA analysis provides overwhelming evidence in support of evolution by means of natural selection. This is an independent form of evidence that was totally unavailable to Darwin, but it backs him up to the hilt. Organisms' structures, including their very DNA, reveal their history. While Darwin correctly observed that ‘Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin’, Carroll gives a more modern take: ‘many genes bear the scars of natural selection’.Throughout the book, Carroll provides numerous examples of how accidentally duplicated segments of DNA have been co-opted—on many different occasions—to evolve new and improved adaptations, such as colour vision, poisonous/venomous neurotoxins, and anti-freeze. Carroll is very good on natural selection being, in addition to a force for change, a force for maintaining the status quo by weeding out disadvantageous mutations. He is also excellent on how the same adaptation can be coded for by different DNA sequences. One of his key arguments is that:DNA sequences that encode for the same protein sequence but that are substantially different are unmistakeable evidence of natural selection allowing mutations that do not change protein function, while acting to eliminate mutations that would. The preservation of genes among different species over vast periods of time is thus definitive proof of one face of natural selection—its power, in Darwin's words, to “rigidly destroy injurious variations.”The book ends with two chapters of ‘afterdinner conversation’. The first is about the historical and ongoing rejection of broadly accepted scientific ideas by people with particular agendas. The second is about the decline of species in modern times. These chapters, although interesting, felt very much to have been ‘tagged on’ at the end, possibly to make the book a bit longer. I think this was unnecessary, and detracts from the book's main thesis.Having said that, The Making of the Fittest is an excellent book, and highly recommended."
29,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112477295-lily-xu,5,"Not going to lie, I was forced to read this for my AP Biology class and went into it with a mindset that leaned more negatively. I didn’t have anything against evolution or anything - just that it was summer and I didn’t want to spend a good portion of it reading a book on evolution and DNA and answering questions on it.Coming out of it, I do feel like I’ve learned a lot and I think the book is incredible. Carroll has written it with a narrative style - not strict like a textbook. His writing style gripped me and his wording helped me understand clearly how the processes worked. Another reason I went into this with a negative mindset was because I thought I probably wouldn’t be able to understand it that well (science has never been my forte) especially without direct teacher explanations. However, this explained ideas clearly, and built on them properly. If I had any questions, I’d turn the page and the answer would be there for me to understand better. Carroll’s book also helped me develop a greater appreciation of this science and I am amazed by the abilities that nature has on its own.As a high school student, I can speak firsthand that we are not fans of doing extra work that deters us from doing things we actually want to do. But, The Making of the Fittest was really helpful in establishing the ideas of evolution and DNA, and I didn’t mind reading it for school. I do feel like I learned a lot about this topic from just this reading. (Though, I certainly didn’t appreciate the 100+ questions my AP Biology teacher made me answer on the book.) (But at least I got the experience out of it.)"
30,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49445673-jarred-de-beer,3,"The Making of the Fittest is a decent book for inquisitive individuals, with a nice balance of technicality and easy reading. As an ex-creationist and now a biology student, there are a few topics I think needed more work in order to be persuasive for a fundamentalist religious audience. The evidence for mutation and natural selection was great, but many creationists acknowledge that as ""micro evolution"" but do not accept that over time, ""micro evolution"" results in cumulative changes that result in ""macro evolution"". So perhaps another chapter showing evidence of speciation would help solidify that aspect of the book. In general, his arguments were not very cohesive and were thus hard to follow. Otherwise, it is an interesting read with some good examples. I recommend it to all biology students, especially if you have the misfortune of being surrounded by fundamentalist creationists, as I am. Due to the lack of cohesive arguments and the lack of depth with some crucial questions, I doubt it will be convincing any fundamentalists."

The author keeps it interesting by using colorful examples that stretch across the different points he is making. Each chapter addressed specific topics that the author clearly defines. Chapters are written in a comfortable flow that brings in a lot of good science and yet kept its moving without getting bogged down in technical minutiae. The author provides abundant examples of various features of evolution, demonstrating that evolution’s greatest evidence is in our DNA. His chapter on science denialism is brilliant and exposes creationism/intelligent design for the fraud that it is. Anyone interesting in understanding evolution more, especially how it relates to modern DNA research will find this book a gold mine. I think science instructors will also benefit from this book as it will provide them with some great examples they can use in the classroom to illustrate evolution. "

DNA isn’t exactly a secret, and the fact that many species share DNA isn’t either, and yet people still doubt that that means anything.It’s a good enough read if you’re looking for examples, though, and good if you really want to get to grips with examples of convergent evolution, too.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

41,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1597887-john,4,"I'll start with the crucial part of my review: I think that the last two chapters of this book should be required scientific literature for high school students. This is because I think the last two chapters make for some fairly harrowing reading if you consider how all of the principles from earlier in the book stack to the conclusions the author reaches. Since this is a science book, I feel I can spoil the ending: Human beings are causing artificial natural selection on a grade scale, essentially killing the planet on fast forward.But of course, to really understand those last chapters, a student would have to read the rest of the book.Now, I've constructed the beginning of the review like this for several reasons. First, I have put out there the most important thing that a person can get from this book. The author will scare you with your own stupidity (or the stupidity of your neighbors, though let's be humble and say we are all stupid to some degree); your appetite for food is driving evolution in other animals right now and you probably don't even know it. You want the biggest turkey on the table for Thanksgiving, right? That means the little ones survived. They will breed, causing turkeys to get smaller and smaller. Never mind that we also inject our turkeys with hormones to make them bigger (which causes its own problems), our appetites are driving wild animals to get smaller since we always want the biggest on our plate. This is causing the ecosystem to collapse.Second, the little aside that I used in the second paragraph is put there to illustrate a frequent habit of the author. He loves his asides.A lot.I cannot remember the last time I saw so many in one book. It seems that 50% of the pages in the book contain some one-line aside that summarizes his thoughts. I love these sorts of attention-grabbing tactics, but for them to be effective, they must be used in moderation. If you can stand an abundance of them, then you are equipped to handle Carroll's style.This leads to the third point I want to make about this book, which is where I want to talk more about the substance of the material that leads to his harrowing conclusion. I have to admit that I skimmed some of the evidence that Carroll supplied. This is not because it isn't compelling--it absolutely is--but because I have already heard it before. I have read (and enjoyed) books on evolution by Dawkins and Jerry Coyne, so much of the evidence that Carroll supplies is familiar to me. If you know the arguments that those two authors make, you may not find much in this book. Again, this familiarity caused me to do some light skimming at familiar parts.However, what I came to realize in the last two chapters would be that there are two benefits to Carroll's structure:1) It lacks some of the snark that the other two authors possess (Dawkins more than Coyne). Those are written with a clear agenda in mind; they are intended to combat creationism, and they don't have much respect for its adherents. Dawkins especially wants to convince you of how right he is while also simultaneously bashing Christian beliefs. When he explains some of the theories about dinosaurs running slower than the flood waters in the Bible (hence, allowing them to be buried lower in the sedimentary layers), a reader can almost hear Dawkins sneering behind his words. Carroll doesn't do this, making this book far more accessible to many people in the audience who might already be hostile to the theory of evolution.2) Thus, tied to the first point, if you have a relative that you want to prove evolution to, this is the book for you, hands down. It is respectful, calm, and does not sensationalize its topic. Carroll is, as some other reviewers have put it, conversational in his approach. He shows the natural wonders of the animal kingdom, and he then invokes scientific principles (in broad terms) that help the reader to understand his argument. Though he sometimes gets lost in technical language (his explanation of the principles of the eye was too brief, especially since he relies on it for so many other things in the book), it isn't so bad that a reasonably intelligent person cannot follow his line of thought to understand the broad principles of what he is saying.The bottom line: If you have read other books on evolution, but you enjoy reading about it, read this; if you have heard enough and you are convinced, skip it. If you thing evolution is false, DEFINITELY read this book."
42,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Popular science books in the field of biology, for me, fall into two classes:1) potentially interesting2) refutations of creationism or intelligent design. If it is aimed at convincing me of something I am already convinced of, and moreover has a vanishingly small chance of even being read by anybody who it might convince, what is the point?There are some which, sadly, fall into neither camp, but I have not found any which fall into both. Until this book, that is.Sean B. Carroll begins his book with a brief examination of the dramatic changes that DNA evidence has brought to the American justice system. The Innocence Project has now exonerated over a hundred wrongly convicted citizens on the basis of DNA evidence, and cold cases where no one was charged for decades have been solved, bringing killers and rapists to justice. Juries, picked from among non-biologists for the most part, have found the DNA evidence convincing enough to change their opinions. Carroll uses that as his starting point for optimism that he can also use overwhelming amounts of DNA evidence to convince Americans of evolution.He is wrong in this belief, of course. Most Americans disbelieve evolution as a way of affirming faith in God, not because they find the evidence lacking. Why American Christianity has latched onto evolution instead of the Big Bang Theory or plate tectonics, which equally contradict a literal interpretation of the Bible, is a matter one could speculate on, but whatever the reason, they have. If Carroll really managed to tie evolution to belief in DNA science in this country, he would likely succeed only in discrediting DNA evidence for the typical jury. They disbelieve, because they want to.However, that doesn't keep Carroll's book from being a fantastic read for the minority who are willing to believe in evolution by natural selection. He can introduce us to fascinating creatures like icefish (which quite literally have icewater in their veins, rather than blood), and use them to illustrate how evolution works (and doesn't work). For every exotic principle or concept, related to probability and multidimensional fitness surfaces and the effects of competition on evolutionary dynamics, he has a concrete example from nature to illustrate the point.He also has an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of science. Not only giants like Darwin and Pasteur, but also lesser known researchers from the past two centuries who pieced together the long and complex story of evolution. Looking at how science works is often even more interesting than looking only at what it has found, and Carroll has done his homework here.Perhaps we shouldn't hold it against him that he thinks (or claims to think) that books of his sort can open America's eyes on his favorite topic. Evolution if a fascinating topic, endlessly rich, far more intriguing than the tame and orderly sequence we are treated to in school. Evolution, properly told, is a riotous display of sex, violence, intrigue, and rococo detail. Carroll has the rare ability to know both the details and the big picture, and the even rarer ability to feed them both to us in prose that moves along at an enjoyable and brisk pace.Too bad the ones who most need to read it never will. Don't let that stop you. It is a pleasure to read, and you feel good afterwards, a small miracle like eating a plate of brownies that is somehow healthy as well. Bravo."
43,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34418720-tim-elston,3,"I anticipated this book with excitement. A seasoned high school biology friend of mine recommended it after I mentioned Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True had, finally when I was fifty, convinced me beyond doubt evolution was, indeed, true. My friend and I had grown up in the same fundamentalist religious denomination and were, in our formative years, indoctrinated to believe in a young earth, as deduced from a literalistic interpretation of Genesis. In my twenties I had discovered and devoured the writings of Ken Ham and Henry Morris, of the Institute for Creation Research, which seemed to provide a scientific basis for my young-earth preconceptions. By age fifty, however, I had ten years since, due to PhD work in New Testament, stopped believing the Bible was anything more than an accidental artifact of human culture. But the doubts about evolution I had developed over decades of fundamentalist indoctrination remained. Coyne's single chapter on the traceability of special evolution in the genetic record utterly convincingly put those doubts to rest.So when I came to Sean B. Carroll's work, the subtitle DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution seemed titillatingly promising. I anticipated it would be a deep-dive expansion of the kind of data-driven analysis of special genetic relatedness I had found so convincing in Coyne. But this is not what I found. Instead, Carroll's treatment presented general maxims and marshaled lightly skimmed examples in support of them. Whereas Coyne's arguments seemed crafted to address an audience he desired to convince, Carroll's narrative felt like preachments to a choir that already had his back. Skeptics of evolution were implicitly ""those other people,"" not the audience to whom Carroll seemed to be speaking. Carroll's conception of his audience may be why I felt he never brought the genetic forensic record to bear incisively against denials of evolution. If I were still a skeptic of evolution, I would come away from his treatment with doubts remaining. In an entire book devoted to a topic about which Coyne convinced me in a single chapter, Carroll left my erstwhile objections unresolved. It's not that what he says here isn't valid or assuring to those who already believe him; it's that he doesn't address a skeptical audience and he doesn't bear down on its objections incisively. Coyne managed to lay out to me, a life-long doubter, the primary, incontrovertible evidence of special evolution found in plant and animal genomes. Carroll missed an opportunity not only to deepen my exposure to that evidence but also unequivocally to convince skeptics like I used to be of it in the first place."

None of this is particularly new, but too many of us insist on sticking our heads in the ground like ostriches (like I've done for so long) instead of allowing God to prove He can handle all comers.This is mostly a book about understanding DNA, which is why I wanted to read it. But as the author comments in the next to last chapter after he's shared a host of good stuff, too many fundamentalist Christians reject evolution without actually considering the science at all (this was basically the case also, I understand, in the recent movie which came out). Among other things, evolution is reduced to a war of ideologies with the one side (1) claiming unfairly that evolutionary science is primarily motivated by an atheistic philosophy (untrue- there are many Christian scientists), (2) citing gadflies as authorities, and (3) all the time exaggerating potential harm. I don't know about you, but my God is big enough not just to have raised Jesus Christ from the dead and to have created the earth and everything in it, but to have done so through any process He should choose, whether it be evolution or other processes humankind has not yet even begun to hypothesize about.In the words of Rev. Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford, which the author quotes: ""Do some people really think that the worldwide scientific community is engaged in a massive conspiracy to hoodwink the rest of us? ... The theory of evolution, far from undermining faith, deepens it. This was quickly seen by Frederick Temple, later Archbishop of Canterbury, who said that God doesn't just make the world, he does something even more wonderful, he makes the world make itself...."

In The Making of the Fittest, Sean Carroll explains some of the overwhelming evidence for evolution provided in DNA, bringing to life new examples from sequences of DNA that once coded for genes no longer used, remnants of ancestral lives, and evidence of evolutionary change. As Carroll explains, ""every evolutionary change between species, from physical form to digestive metabolism, is due to — and recorded in — changes in DNA"" (p 14). Using this forensic evidence of evolution, Carroll reveals how these relics provide new ""sources of insights into traits and capabilities that have been abandoned as species evolved new lifestyles"" (p 16). Carroll also deals a blow to the claim that evolution occurs completely at random, and that order and complexity of nature are surely outside the realm of random processes. The descriptions offered in The Making of the Fittest provide powerful examples of how evolution actually works, and why evolution matters.One cool creature I learned about in this book was the ""bloodless"" Icefish, who are not without blood but actually have blood that lacks red blood cells and hemoglobin (so their blood looks like water)! Their evolutionary narrative takes place over the past 55 million years, during which temperatures of the Antarctic Ocean have dropped, from about 20° C to less than 0° C in some locales. A cold environment presents challenges to living organisms, which have to adapt in response: for example, since fluids like blood move much more slowly in colder temperature, animals in such environments compensate by evolving less viscous blood and/or increasing the surface area for oxygen exchange.This is another work by Carroll that showcases his superb writing style and research prowess, and elegantly reaffirms Evolutionary Theory with yet more empirical data. I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it!"
47,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83139-jennifer,4,"It's a very rare book review that causes me to immediately go and purchase a book. But that's exactly what I did when I stumbled across a glowing review while browsing SEED's science blogs. Clearly I was feeling a serious lack of science and critical thinking in my life that day.While I have some criticisms of this book, most of them stem from the fact that it was written for a general audience (and I'm glad that it was) and so sometimes had less detailed descriptions of physiology than I would have liked to see. But I'm getting ahead of myself! The Making of the Fittest examines DNA evidence as the ultimate forensic proof of evolution -- rightly pointing out that DNA evidence is routinely used and universally accepted in courts of law. Which raises the question -- how can someone accept, say, the use of DNA to prove paternity, and yet not accept the overwhelming evidence provided by DNA analysis as to the mechanisms and effectiveness of evolution?Carroll takes a comprehensive approach to proving his case -- from addressing common arguments of evolution-deniers (most notably that evolution ""couldn't have had enough time"" and the evolution of the human eye), showing examples both of useful genes deteriorating when selection pressure was removed and of how under similar selective pressures, many species independently evolved the same adaptations, to some interesting discussions of other historical resistances to other scientific ideas, and why this resistance happens over and over with major new ideas.I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in evolution."
48,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"Sean B. Carroll's The Making of the Fittest examines the genetics of evolution, relating to readers not only how changes come about and are transmitted to the next generation, but how our genes demonstrate the passing of an evolutionary river out of Eden with the same surety that the flattened plains of the midwest testify to the passing of glaciers eons ago. After detailing the myriad ways in which genetics illuminates the inner workings and history of evolution, Carroll casts a critical eye against proponents of intelligent design and creationism. In the stressful, chaotic world which all organisms inhabit, where circumstances and relations between prey and predator are in a state of constant flux, there is no room for grand designs: only on-the-hoof and on-the-fly jury-rigging to respond to a given moment's crisis will do. Making of the Fittest supplies readers with both broad principles (the evolutionary arms race, in which no species is ever the 'perfected' winner, only carrying temporary momentum in the battle for survival) and specific practices, like how complex organs are formed by cobbling together smaller ones. Though a short-enough work, it seems more technical than many other works on biology, probably because it focuses on the nitty-gritty details of genetics: one chapter is called ""The Everyday Math of Evolution"", and concerns mutation rates. Though of interest to general science readers, a little genetic refresher might be helpful before starting in. "
49,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This is another interesting work on recent developments in research on biological evolution, and how these discoveries remove any reasonable doubt from the fundamental correctness of evolution as the mechanism of creation -- the evidence is truly overwhelming. This book focuses on the many recent discoveries of evolution's record in DNA. Carroll introduces the topic by mentioning a recent case in which a person imprisoned for 18 years was freed, based on analysis of DNA. If we are willing to accept such evidence in a life-or-death case, why aren't we willing to accept it as evidence of evolution?Carroll includes, near the beginning, an excellent exposition of the basic mathematics behind genetics and evolution. Don't blanch -- it's all pretty easy, especially with Carroll's very clear explanations. Carroll goes on to discuss things like ""immortal genes"" (DNA sections that are virtually identical all the way from primitive yeasts to humans), ""fossil genes"" (genes that became dysfunctional, and now are retained in degraded form as relics of their former selves), and other very interesting topics.If you like this book, you might also like to read Daniel Fairbank's book ""Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA "" by Daniel J. Fairbanks (a biologist at Brigham Young University)."
50,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,3,"Pretty accessible and quick explanation of the evidence of evolution as manifested in the genes and DNA of all life on Earth. The author manages to convey main concepts such as how random mutation over great lengths of time can and do give rise to the diversity of organisms today, without getting too technical and detailed about the actual processes, one can still follow (barely at times) this 'dumb downed' version of molecular biology thanks to some good illustrations as well. The similarity in the genes of the most outwardly different lifeforms, such as flies and humans is truly remarkable and goes to show how the basic building blocks of proteins and DNA underlie all organisms. Plenty of examples are used to show how minor differences in DNA sequences can result in dramatic phenotypic differences. Many reviewers have written about the final two chapters being extraneous. Undoubtedly they are, since they do not add to our knowledge of genes and evolution, but are more philosophical in nature. The author does make this qualification early on so it is expected. Personally I felt that the penultimate chapter on the critiques of evolution was a nice way to end the book, while the last one on the urgency of conservation in the face of the current human induced extinction crisis really did feel out of place. "
51,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,3,"In the last few years the genomes of many different organisms were sequenced, making it possible to trace their evolution by looking at the DNA. An antarctic fish has no red blood cells, as its tissues absorb oxygen directly from the water; however, its DNA has a pseudogene that once made hemoglobin. By looking at the mutations in this pseudogene, it is possible to estimate, when it became nonfunctional, and compare this time to the time known from geology when the Antarctic Ocean froze. Old World monkeys and apes, including ourselves, have three-color vision, thanks to a duplicated and mutated gene for an opsin molecule; so does one New World monkey, and the fact that different amounts of junk DNA were duplicated with the gene in the two lineages shows that these mutations happened independently. Certain deepwater fish can see in the ultraviolet range, and so can cetaceans; the mutation that enabled them to do so happened independently to the same codon in the same gene.All of this is interesting, but I wish there were more explanations of the technology that enabled all this to be discovered, and fewer rants about ignorant creationists. I also wonder if the author approved of the book cover, which has DNA turning the wrong way."
52,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893808-jack,5,"What a great book! This book is complete with everything a good book needs, not just every science book, but every book. Period. A great storyline with an easy going style, powerful messages for the reader and well researched and factually accurate on all points. And for me as an evolutionary biology student, it's about one of my favorite topics: evolution and how we know it's a fact. This book takes you from the icy waters of the south pole to the humid and warm forests of Africa, examines the development of color vision in primates to the origin of eyes in the first place; all in the name of explaining the evidence for evolution from DNA. Fresh and up to date with the latest research this simply is the book to read for anyone interested in how evolution works, the evidence behind the theory, and most importantly how evolution impacts our lives on a daily basis. Seriously I never expected to enjoy this book as much I did and I'm tempted to start it over and read it again. There's so much in this book that one can't possibly absorb all of it on one reading only. And unlike some dry textbook (this book is used as a companion book in some college undergrad biology courses), the lively and enriching information is grabbing and exciting to read. :)"
53,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,4,"Combine Ignorance with Ideology and you create a formidable adversary that is similar to a bacteria that has developed resistance to antibiotics and poses a serious threat to the well-being of the body it has infected. Humans, rarely realize how their own minds can be as easily high-jacked just like a virus on a computer and so once infected will ardently fight to resist change even when our survival depends on it. Evolution at this point in history should be beyond dispute and yet amazingly over a hundred and fifty years since it was originally identified as the foundation of biology and life there is actually growing resistance to it. I blame this in part on the Academic community. They are only concerned with discovering truth but they don't know how to package it and sell it to everyone else. They are inexperienced in slick and clever propaganda and marketing. They also don't know how to translate their findings in such a way to make people notice and care. That means that in the fight of public opinion the ones with the loudest and cleverest voices win and in that arena the Scientific Community consistently loses. "
54,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3933536-paul,4,"- Opener was a bit slow (review of evolution, basic genetics)- Heart of the book was good, with general-audience level detail describing the way DNA works in the evolutionary process. Any recent biology major would know about most of the concepts here...of course that's not me...so it was a mixture of review and a few new concepts for me.- Interesting analysis paralleling Soviet biology from the 30's through 60's, chiropractic vaccine denial, and the denial of evolution. Though essentially a defense of evolution against its attackers (with little unique to this work in concept), the details of the parallel stories was quite engaging.- Appeal to environmentalism at the end was half-good...half emphasized the role that evolution plays in the need for environmental responsibility (relevant to book and interesting), and half was a general appeal to environmental responsibility (I supposed I can't say that's a bad thing, but it's not really related to the rest of the book)."
55,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8769239-lauren,4,"I enjoyed this read, though luckily I was already a bit familiar with the material-it made the more textbook-y passages go down easier. I liked Mr. Carroll's style, he is clearly a passionate biologist, especially in his chapter around deniers of science fact, particularly evolution. I liked the layout of the book, it was pretty clear, and chapters themselves were clearly, simplistically (as much as possible) laid out. This was definitely general public-targeted. The book definitely ends on a sad note, which I suppose I must forgive the author for, as he admits this himself in the chapter. It would have been nice to read some follow-through on what should be done, instead it's largely a fact-based rant. I would recommend to any readers interested in a relatively light read on the subject of biology, DNA, genetics or evolution. Though targeted at evolution, this book is enjoyable for any interested in science."
56,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet,3,"I am waffling between 3 and 4 stars; I feel like parts of this book are fairly simplistic for the subject matter, which is a good thing for a Pop Science book, for sure. However, there are other aspects that are really technical when describing how bits of DNA move around and swap and create mutations. I feel like the combination doesn't quite work; anyone who is happily slogging through the technical bits does not need the overly simplistic tone of the story parts; and anyone who finds the simplistic stories perfect for their knowledge base probably won't make it through the formulas and equations of the technical bits. Which, for the record, is FINE. I just wanted more. (Also, as a self-proclaimed Darwin nerd and armchair evolutionist, perhaps my wanting more isn't entirely fair, but it is what it is.)"
57,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974188-tony-duncan,4,A well written and step by step using a specific approach to show how rock solid the proof of evolution isl i especially liked how he use the evidence of decay of unused genes tied to the development of parallel genetic evolution for specific traits. the idea that evolution sometimes uses the almost identical solution genetically and the other possibility that evolution uses completely different genetic routes for the same practical effect are very powerful.My only complaint would be that if one was Not interested in the nuts and bolts of genetics he gave more technical explanations than necessary for the lay reader.I was also VERY glad that he discussed the importance of understanding the role of genetics in evolution regarding the devastation that we are wreaking on the oceans
58,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5910924-dylan-christiana,5,"This book was excellent, but if you're not familiar with evolutionary biology I would highly recommend that you read his other book first, ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful,"" as it will give you a deep understanding of this issues discussed here. It is frustrating to me that most people (many science teachers included), when discussing/teaching evolutionary biology stop at Darwin & Mendel, as if we haven't made any NEW scientific progress in the last 150 years! We've gone from bean counters to super computers in that time, why oh why do people not understand that we've made similar leaps and bounds in evolutionary and developmental biology? I highly recommend this book, but I even more highly recommend the previous one, as it will have a greater impact on the largest population. "
59,0393061639,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18346013-yasser-mohammad,4,"I found this book be accident and it was a fortunate one. The book is clearly a defense of the evolutionary theory but it is also much more. The most important - distinguishing factor of this book - compared with othe biology books for the public - is that it does not shy away from the details. For example, the book the details of the mechanism for evolution of new genes based on gene copying in thr case of color vision evolution. It gives more focus on genetic drift and its role in evolution compared with other similar books. I really enjoyed the chapters explaining the evolution of three pigment color vision and yhe evolution of the eye even though the later could have benefited from more details."
