I was not disappointed -- Richard Dawkins has hit a real home run here.This volume is chock-full of some of the most interesting, well-written and thought-provoking essays and articles you find find anywhere, written by some of the best minds of the 20th and early 21st century. There are articles by biologists, physicists, chemists, psychologists and cosmologists (among many others). Some of these authors and writings will likely be familiar to readers who have read some of the numerous semi-popular books recently written by modern scientists -- e.g., writings by Steven Hawkings and Carl Sagan will be familiar to many. But others caught me, for one, by surprise.For instance, the volume includes an astonishing but little-known essay by Albert Einstein on what he calls the ""cosmic religious feeling"", a feeling shared by many who have probed the depths of the elegant laws of the universe: ""Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength.""Other articles express well the great humility that comes to many scientists when they grasp how small our place is in the universe, and the huge amount that remains to be learned.There are some weak spots. For example, I thought that the excerpt from Richard Feynman failed to grasp the cleverness of this great thinker. I also wished that a few other authors had been included. But all in all, this is one great book. Highly recommended!"
1,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592864-kevin,5,"How do you pick the best science writing of the twentieth century? Really it all comes down to a matter of opinion, which almost always results in the complaint and special pleading for authors and works left on the cutting room floor (I mean no geology! Come on can’t we get just a little respect). Richard Dawkins never the less makes the noble and very worthwhile attempt to collect some of the very best that science has to offer from the scientist themselves.The book itself is a collection of over a hundred short passages, excerpts, essays, and even a few poems taken from the likes of Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Francis Crick, Stephen Gould, Brian Greene, Jared Diamond, Alan Turning, Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan, Primo Levi, the list goes on and on. Just this alone would make a great collection, but Dawkins also includes the men and women that contributed so much to the worlds of astronomy, oceanography, evolution, particle physics, and genetics that most and certainly I have never had the pleasure of coming across before. Dawkins introduces each and every essay with a humbling and often personal anecdote informing the reader on not just who the author is but why they are important and why they deserve to be included with the ranks of the very best. The book is organized into four distinct groups “What Scientists Study,” “Who Scientists Are,” “What Scientists Think,” and “What Scientists Delight in” providing a unify theme that serves as a backdrop of the often awe inspiring essays that follow. At times the essays can be a bit dry, but Dawkins tries to reveal the whole spectrum that science has to offer. It’s also not a light fluffy affair; some science literacy is needed because Dawkins does not shy away from the technical here. I found myself doing something I love with really great non-fiction works: further research. Not being so well versed in some of the genetics and higher mathematics/physics I was required to independent research and information gathering to grasp the full meaning of that particular essay. I learned so much more than I ever expected. The excerpts and short passages could be so tantalizing that I was sometimes left wishing for more. Couple that with the exposure to works by scientist I would have never come across before has caused my wishlist to implode. I only wish there were more collections like this one by different editors to really show off the diversity of that science has to offer."
2,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2364523-palmyrah,5,"Richard Dawkins has a serious claim to be the world's greatest living science writer. This is a title for which there are presently more claimants today than at any other era in history; popular science writing, once a minor genre targeted mainly at nerdy schoolboys, has burgeoned into a successful and prolific contemporary publishing industry. Here, Dawkins picks the cherries from the current crop, but he also casts his net back a good deal further, all the way to the beginning of the twentieth century. This allows him to include essays and meditations by the likes of Einstein, the quantum fathers and of course the leading lights of Dawkins's own field, biology. Biologists, as a group, seem to be unusually endowed with literary talent. Dawkins gives us a broad selection that includes the best of the lot: Niko Tinbergen and the subline J.B.S. Haldane.The book consists of short excerpts from other books and essays, as well as a poem or two. One's only wish is that the pieces were longer, though that would probably have made the book unfeasibly large unless some deserving contributors were dropped. The material is generally well chosen and the order in which it appears is logical without being over-obvious.In the popular mind, Richard Dawkins is most notorious as the author of The God Delusion and a public promoter of atheism. Although more than a couple of essays have a tangential relevance to this theme, there is little or no direct promotion of atheism in this book. For all that, it is certainly a book with an agenda. It strives to communicate not only the power but also the sheer fascination and beauty of science, to show how a truly scientific outlook can satisfy not only our desire for knowledge and power, but also our aesthetic, philosophical and spiritual cravings; and to a degree, it succeeds.There are dozens of pieces here, each with a short introduction by Dawkins himself. These never overshadow or upstage the work they are introducing, but complement each piece beautifully.There really isn't anything negative to say about this book, apart from noting that one wishes there were even more of it to enjoy. Highly recommended."
3,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,4,"Dawkins's anthology of 20th-century science writing.You get the impression some people were included just because Dawkins had some public disagreement with them, and now wants to show that there are no hard feelings, rather than because they had something interesting to say. If that's the case, I guess we should be happy he didn't include anything by Mary Midgley; but then, unlike Gould and Hoyle, she's (unfortunately) still alive.I suppose the best way to approach an anthology like this is to regard it as a plate of appetizers to help you decide what to pick for the main course. If you do, though, be aware that at least three of the excerpted works are considerably shittier than the excerpt makes them look: Davies's ""The Goldilocks Enigma"", Penrose's ""The Emperor's New Mind"", and to a lesser extent, Hofstadter's ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"" (which is crap, don't get me wrong; it's just that the excerpt doesn't make it look particularly good anyway). Perhaps James Watson should be included here as well, but I don't think anyone who knows anything about Watson would mistake him for a writer worth reading anyway.My disagreement with a handful of the inclusions shouldn't be taken as a dismissal of the whole anthology, though: most of the remaining eighty or so works are very good indeed. Some of them are a bit too short, but they'd have to be. At the very least they give the reader a place to start looking, and as a whole, they clearly illustrate what Dawkins set out to explain: how scientists think, and why science is fucking interesting."
4,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"A solid collection of science writing, though not without its flaws. I have two primary complaints: the collection is organized rather arbitrarily, and it's heavily weighted towards biology. A better title might have been 'The Oxford book of Richard Dawkins' favorite science writing'.That said, none of the selections are excessively long, and most make for a good read. Dawkins' keeps his comments to a minimum - a paragraph or two with each selection - and on the whole these are both eloquent and interesting.There's a small subset of this book I'd recommend strongly. As a whole, it's still worth checking out."
5,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31505900-pam,5,"This book was perfect for my level of scientific understanding as a 'layperson' with knowledge of the scientific method. Books written by non-scientists about science or scientific discoveries are fascinating to me....possibly because of the irony of dissecting and studying those who do that for a living. But books written by scientists with the linguistic skills to communicate without jargon are a real treat. “This is a collection of good writing by professional scientists, not excursions into science by professional writers,"" writes Dawson. The essays were well-chosen, and each brought a brief, discrete view of a particular scientific discovery or endeavor. The tediousness of the profession becomes obvious, and the amount of devotion to microscopic or highly speculative or theoretical lines of inquiry is impressive. Yet, the simple 4-section layout provides a basic guide as to the purpose of Dawkins' choices for the anthology: What Scientists Study, Who Scientists Are, What Scientists Think and What Scientists Delight In. One of the reasons this book attracted me was because as a University student in social sciences, a required reading was one by Dawkins on writing, and his evolution from scientist to writing teacher. He employs the rigor of science in sentence construction and deploys the precision of it to vocabulary, practically eliminating adjectives. Spare language with low word count is the goal, and he deplores parenthetical phrases and over-explanation. Forced to read convoluted theory from the 17th to 19th century at that time, this was an advancement of science I could admire!The book was informative, inspirational and thought-provoking. It was interesting to read about the practice of science that continues to produce technology, medicine and understanding and gain a fly on the wall view. Also, it was refreshing to read of scientists who reconcile their faith with science, and whose science produces awe, wonder and joy, as so much written about science today merely pits it against religion or political agendas, so much by Dawkins is specifically anti-religious and overtly atheistic. Science is invoked so often in social media comments and memes, it's easy to forget there are real scientists and that science is a job that people do every day that makes the world a better place. The anthology ends with Carl Sagan's The Pale Blue Dot, the classic that my and my children's generations were raised with, describing a science of awe and wonder, that did not see religion as an enemy: ""A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” Nor was science for the elite; it was the goal of Sagan's life to make it accessible on TV and in lay media, just as it is the goal of Dawkins to make it readable. He succeeded with this anthology in getting back to his roots as a practicing scientist, and appreciating the discipline, practice, and body of scholarship that science was before it was politicized, introducing us to a diverse and hard-working cast of thinkers, researchers and writers that are scientists. "
6,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7277957-steve-stuart,5,"If you want to be inspired, either by the majesty and beauty of science, or by the passion and skill of those who write about it, pick up this book and read a few sections. It contains scores of snippets, each just a handful of pages, on dozens of different subjects, by a range of different authors, and most of them are inspirational.When I bought the book, I didn't realize that the readings were all from popular science writing, for non-specialist audiences. Misled by the cover art and by the list of authors, I expected a collection of sparkling gems of writing from the primary literature. There are, indeed, many samples from notable scientists; if you can name a scientist from a field you don't work in, chances are he is represented here. (And the male pronoun is appropriate; female authors fill only a few percent of the pages.) But these selections are taken from their writings for the general public, post-Nobel and in the memoir-writing or science-popularization phase of their career. Nonetheless, the writing is still impressive. Although not models for good technical science writing, as I had hoped, the excerpts do a great job of conveying the enthusiasm for science and delight in discovery that is shared by every great scientist and science writer. Another thing that caught me off guard was the emphasis on biology, and especially evolutionary biology. There are some samples here from astronomers and physicists, but as often as not they are writing outside the field that they are known for. We get Einstein's musings on religion and philosophy, Schrödinger's description of entropy for biologists, and astrophysicist Fred Hoyle's take on evolution. It's not that these are not interesting, and I can understand why Dawkins has a soft spot for writings on the biological sciences, but I expected, and would have enjoyed, a little more representation from the physical scientists.Even with these quibbles, the books is outstanding. It's very enjoyable to read, whether you want to admire the writing or absorb some of the science. Many of the passages made me curious to read the longer works from which they were taken, several of which have already made it onto my bookshelf."
7,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2578079-roger-bailey,4,"This is an anthology of essays edited by Richard Dawkins, one of the foremost promoters of the philosophical materialist view of the world currently writing. His choices and his short introductions to these essays continue his work. Despite the title which indicates a more general science approach this book does lean more toward the biological sciences and evolutionary biology in particular. Since biology is my area of formal training and since I do have a special interest in evolution that suits me just fine and it is what you would expect from Richard Dawkins too. Nevertheless, those of you who are interested in physics, cosmology, mathematics and other branches of science will find something to your liking too. Furthermore, the essays have been chosen for their literary merit, so the writing is clear and engaging. It is quite comprehensible to the intelligent layman and provides learning possibilities to those who have never studied science too. Even the essays on mathematics are bereft of equations in favor of instructive and entertaining discussion."
8,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803250-mike-suter,4,"The charm of anthologies like this is that they expose you to writers you might not otherwise encounter. Selected by Richard Dawkins, this book is weighted heavily toward Darwinian scientists. Inevitably, the selections are uneven... Steve Jones on genetics is fascinating; a section on the mathematical classification of spirals was less captivating. The section by Douglas Hofstadter (""Godel, Escher and Bach"") was especially intriguing. This is an interesting collection, but the selections are so truncated that it's like snacking on h'orderves; no substitute for the full course. A non-scientist will be left with a very limited understanding of these scientific issues. It would have been helpful to have a chapter describing the main areas of recent discovery and controversy in each scientific discipline to put these selections in better context. The short pre-ambles from Dawkins are inadequate."
9,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,3,"This is a compilation of essays by, and about science and scientists. I read it for a book group and it did provide the basis for a wide range of interesting discussions. It is not really a science book, but does related to the way scientists think, and what moves them. It has a spiritual sense about the grandeur of nature and the mind of man."
10,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9244860-nirmal,5,"Dawkins explains everything that is related to science, what scientists study, what they do and what they are happily doing."
11,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127986-fr-ted,5,"Dawkins puts together a collection of excerpts and short essays from a wide variety of scientists all reflecting on aspects of life, the universe or science. Dawkins presents science as the replacement for religion in human thinking or perhaps as a new religion based in materialism. The book shows science as an expression of beauty and truth, of seeking out mystery, of helping us humans understand our place in the universe. Science, in Dawkin's imagination, can do everything religion can. There is a lot for the theistic person to admire about science and how it approaches truth and meaning and beauty and order. Science has endeavored to free humans from superstitions and natural philosophies by assuming it represents a higher plane of human development, relying on the rationality of the scientific method, on materialism and on mathematics rather than noetic sophistry and revealed religion. In any case, whatever criticisms can be leveled at revealed religion (and there are many which are justified), still even science is in the hands of the same humans who relied on religion. Humans will be humans. We may make some decisions based in scientific fact, but still we have to make social decisions - and these decisions will be shaped by human frailty, faults and one-sided thinking which will continue to influence all we do. Science may imagine it can live somehow above morality but humanity will continue to intervene into that picture - and with it human sin will always be present in how we treat one another. For the reality is we are not looking only at a material world which can be studied dispassionately, we are looking at each other and all of our science will always be part of how we relate to one another, which is always more complex than mere materialism. Science may be completely rational when dealing with the quantum level or with the entirety of the universe, but it still will be dealt with by humans and so a human factor will always influence what we do. And we are not able to live only with focusing on math and materialism, for we have to deal with one another, and this can't be done with mathematical equations. Human consciousness and conscience means uncertainty is just as much a part of our existence as it is on the quantum level."

But that's a small quibble for a book like this. The categorisation is interesting, in that it's not be science category but almost by motivation. I think that helps because it keeps you guessing about what's coming next. So it keeps you going through the few lesser entries because there's always something more around the corner."

Quibbles: Too biology-heavy - even Ernst Mayr’s excerpt is about biology. And Einstein ‘s bit is about atheism. It’s interesting, but I was hoping it might be about, well, physics. On the whole, though, a superb introduction for this non-Science graduate. "

22,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"THE OXFORD BOOK OF MODERN SCIENCE WRITING EDITED BY RICHARD DAWKINS: Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene, The Ancestor’s Tale, and The God Delusion, needs no introduction having established himself as a reputable voice when discussing science in its many forms. His latest effort is The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing, in a hefty tome, where Dawkins attempts to present a concise view of science to the world in many short passages from many different scientists of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that tessellate together to form a beautiful volume of writing.The book is divided into four parts, as Dawkins organizes the vast wealth of science writing available not in chronological order, but groups the extracts into the following categories: “What Scientists Study,” “Who Scientists Are,” “What Scientists Think,” “What Scientists Delight in.” Organizing it this ways serves to make the book more entertaining in the variety of subjects that are presented when the book is read from cover to cover. Should the reader want to use the book more as a reference tool or to look up some specific authors or terms, there is a thorough index at the end of the book. With each extract, Dawkins offers up his own commentary and reason for choosing the specific piece.All the great scientists make an appearance here: Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Francis Crick, Brian Greene, Jared Diamond, Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan, Primo Levi, the list goes on and on. But this list is not reserved for the greats of science, but many of the women and men who have worked hard in their lives to further the knowledge of science in areas such as genetics, evolution, string theory, relativity, and mathematics. The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing is a weighty, comprehensive book with almost everything science has had to offer in the last hundred years or so, and while it may not be for the science novice, the ideas, theories, and hypotheses expressed in this book have reshaped science, and offered up hope and ideals for future answers and theories that will continue to change the world as we know it.For more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter."
23,0199216800,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10024577-holmes,5,"While I don't totally agree with Dawkins's selections (some articles I just didn't enjoy reading), there are gems that are so radiant that the anthology on the whole shines out in brilliance. There are excerpts that inform (e.g. Martin Rees's ""Just Six Numbers""); there are excerpts that fascinate (e.g. Steven Pinker's ""The Language Instinct""); there are excerpts that entertain (e.g. Douglas Hofstadter's ""Godel, Escher, Bach""); there are excerpts that captivate (e.g. Primo Levi's ""The Periodic Table""); and there are excerpts that inspire (e.g. Carl Sagan's ""Pale Blue Dot""). As a result, this collection is one well worth treasuring and returning to. Sadly, to many people, science writing is synonymous with dry, specialized writing full of jargons and equations. This book proves that it is not so. By collecting the best writings from the best scientists, Dawkins gives us a peek of the wonderful wide world of science. And thanks to the scientists' insights and wisdom, we realize that science is definitely not at odds with the arts or humanities or even religion. Science is as much a pilgrimage for truth and beauty as any other pursuits."

The selected pieces are necessarily extracts rather than complete works, and the result feels more like a scrapbook than an anthology. Certainly none of the pieces is bad, and several of them made me want to seek out more by that author (from the sublime - Albert Einstein's thoughts on God - to the ridiculous - Francis Crick's advice to avoid gatherings of more than two Nobel Prize winners). But the nature of the book means a succession of changes of pace, some of which are rather jarring. This contains a number of chunks out of various excellent books about science but doesn't quite end up being one itself."

Reading this anthology confirmed my excited expectations: a collection of gems. Most authors were more or less known to me, at least by name. But only from few had I read original texts. This collection made up for that. And some of the authors I have now added to my must-read list.The selection made by Dawkins is, as can be expected given his background, skewed towards evolutionary biology, although the end made up with so e good pieces by physicists and cosmologists. I found this imbalance not disturbing.I very much liked the comments by Dawkins that introduced each author, they give a nice context on the often personal familiarity of him with the authors.Al in all a beautiful book, that I can highly recommend to anyone who is fascinated by nature and the beauty of the human endeavor of understanding it.FolkertWww.ExcitingTechnology.net"

This book features a selection of great science writers from the early 20th century through 2009, when it was published. It includes many great pieces, ranging form Alan Turing's article on the Imitation Game to Einstein on Relativity and Crick on the nature of life. The list of writers is impressive: Sagan, Gould, Greene, Pinker, Gamow (a Mr. Tompkins story, and if you aren't familiar with Mr. Tompkins, you should be if you like science writing), Hoyle, Diamond, Feynman, Hawking, Thomas, Sacks ... the list goes on.

It's hard to escape Dawkins' appreciation from some of the most exciting minds in our history. Their love and reverence for truth is truly inspiring and provoking. Unfortunately, I find this collection dense and difficult to read. Dawkins' commentary at the beginning of each excerpt is distracting and self-serving. The excerpts are too short for true enjoyment.

Some pieces are much more readable than others, all written by scientists, some of which don't communicate ideas as well as others. Some pieces are brilliant, though from the authors you expect: Carl Sagan, Rachel Carson. Some was just plain dense and boring, though. Pick about 25% of the writing out and condense this tome, and you have a superb collection...as is, in my opinion, it's just too much for the general public."

But the first half of the book is almost completely dominated by the biological sciences - the selection of authors appeared significantly biased in favour of Dawkins' own interests. But in the later section the range rather spread, but still I was left feeling that the selection wasn't entirely representative. Nevertheless, some interesting and inspirational reading."
