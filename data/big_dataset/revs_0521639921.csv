0,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47033884-marcin,4,5/5 for new people in physics :)
1,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46948715-kaju-janowski,4,"As a physicist I name this book one of the best to recommend to those interested in physics yet with no mathematical background. It is a pleasurable read, quick to catch interest and easy enough to keep it till the end. "
2,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7972478-yasmeen,4,"Very cool, cute book. To be honest, science is not exactly my biggest passion in life, but I do find certain aspects of it extremely interesting, like relativity and quantum theory. It's really nice to have ideas like that made accessible and even entertaining. I liked the format of reading Mr Tomkins' musings followed by some actual explanation by the professor- it meant that I was generally able to follow what was happening. The overarching narrative was cute too, and made the whole thing feel a little more like a novel, which was nice. I also thought the book really stuck to what the average person (well, the averagely nerdy person such as myself) would find interesting and didn't stray into fields of science that became dry and irrelevant. So; pretty good overall. "
3,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6086918-brian,2,A lot of the fun and charm of the original was lost in this politically correct update.
4,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116263103-nicolas-karpf,5,"The New World of Mr Tompkins has been one of the most interesting, yet most educational books I have ever read. The book was presented in such a way where my interest was drawn almost immediately, with my first look of the book assuming it would be less than able to keep my attention. To my surprise, I was wrong, as the dreams of Mr Tompkins throughout the chapters had kept my attention thoroughly and constantly. With these forms of interesting dreams, there was an equal part of bland versions that went into deeper detail of the concept, in the form of “lectures”. Although they were a little harder to keep attention through, it never had me close the book to wait another day to want to learn more about the sciences, whether it be about the possibly infinite expansion of the universe, or the quantum theory of the miniscule of miniscule possibilities coming to life, such as whiskey boiling on its own. I would strongly recommend this book as something to be taught in science classes."
5,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63755245-gonzalo-fern-ndez-victorio,5,"Don't expect this a book easy to read. I found many teams I needed to reread a couple of pages back because I felt I wasn't getting an important concept. The final part on the Standard Model (current theory on quantum mechanics) is full of terms that look very similar to me.But this is a great book. It presents in understandable way, an overview of the current state of physics, including relativity, quantum mechanics and Big Bang. It doesn't require a high level of ""classic"" Physics. The main issue would be that I ended up with the feeling that the Standard Model is loosely similar to candle trading in stock markets: something that predicts results (probably SM much better than candles) but don't really explain. Maybe we've reached the point there is nothing to explain."
6,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This reworking of a classic work of popular science is well put together and engaging. I can not comment on the differences between this and earlier iterations like Mr. Tompkins in Paperback. It explains various concepts in physics using fanciful examples to give one a qualitative feel for some of the implications, very little of the precise math or the like is conveyed although an equation or two pop up. Some parts are just straightforward exposition of physics and may drag a little, but overall it achieves a good mix of readability and informativeness."
7,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55205816-alecsphys,5,"Really an enjoyable reading! You can move from relativity theories to quantum mechanics and particle physics in a smooth way. It should be a reading for high level school and and undergraduate students. Really nice is the way the physical properties of the matter are introduced, like electric charge and nuclear isospin."
8,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27790017-peter-jones,4,"My wife got it from the library for my son and I to read together, thinking it would be similar to the Uncle Albert books. It was quickly obvious it was written to an adult audience, so I've continued reading it on my own. Very well done. I especially liked the chapter on antimatter - it stretched me at first, but eventually gave me a perspective I've either never seen or never understood before."
9,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16974919-nina-selezneva,5,Wonderful pop science accessible to all audiences 
10,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105280234-roberto,3,Good but difficult to grasp at first when you don't know modern physics. Really interesting. I will recommend it to people who will like to understand the world in an easier way.
11,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52884944-harshit-tabyal,4,"It covers topics mostly from quantum physics and one or two chapter are on relativity. It is a excellent book for layman who wants to know about these subjects. Concepts are explained through funny and entertaining adventures of Mr Tompkins.You won't understand the concepts of quantum physics in entirety (otherwise there would be no need for university education) but still it presents before you pretty good picture of things.If you want to understand concepts quantum physics like a proper scientist, college level mathematics is a must.But for lay guys, beginners, school students... go for this book, you will enjoy it.(This revised edition of Original Book ""Mr Tompkins in paperback"". Some new chapters are added and some politically incorrect writing is reworked)"
12,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57585621-tyler-defrancesco,5,"The more modern, updated-to-be-slightly-more-accurate version of Mr Tompkins in Paperback, by physicist George Gamow. While a slight familiarity with Physics is helpful to enjoy a lot of sections - namely the sections high-energy and particle physics - this novel is a perfect introduction into the qualitative concepts of a wide breadth of modern topics in physics, ranging from Special and General Relativity, to statistical and quantum mechanics. Mathematical models are not a focus in this novel, nor are they even included for the sake of showing them to the reader, in most cases. Thus, it is accessible to virtually anybody with an interest in these topics. Since it is written by an actual physicist, you won't need to worry about running into the disgusting amount of misinformation and pop-sci that plagues many of these fields on the internet. "
13,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1657155-jenny,4,"After reading about George Gamow earlier this year, I wanted to go back and reread some of his Mr. Tompkins stories. This updated edition was available through the public library. It retains many of Gamow's original stories and the lyrics and music to the Cosmic Opera written by his wife. It does not contain many of the more dated and sexist references from the original and updates the physics to what was known and accepted in 1999. More importantly, reading this book reminded me of reading my father's copies of the original Mr. Tompkins books when I was in junior high. "
14,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/744209-john,4,"Pretty good. Though nowhere near the PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH comparisons. I got a bit weary toward the end and just like the Mr. Tompkins of the title, found myself fighting nodding off. Which he seems to do whenever anyone starts talking science stuff. If I had been the professor and some bald headed jerk always showed up to my lectures only to sit in the back and snore loudly, I would have rudely disinvited him from any future attendances. Not introduce him to my daughter. Still. A decent frame to situate the fundemental theories behind the physics."
15,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1854110-l-s,3,"Mr. Tompkins adventures are really delicious. But I feel the last 3 chapters by Stannard don't fit very well in the volume. Argumente ale expansiunii Universului:- faptul că vedem galaxiile foarte îndepărtate aşa cum erau în urmă cu numărul corespunzător de milioane de ani-lumină- creşterea numărului de galaxii pe volum de spaţiu cu cât mai în urmă priveşti în spaţiu; cu alte cuvinte, universul se rarefiază- quasarii pe care în prezent îi vedem dar ei nu mai există*- raportul hidrogen-heliu (77%-23%)- radiaţia cosmică de fond. http://wp.me/p3M0N-14q"
16,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19395915-steve,4,"This is a great update to a classic book. The original adventures of Mr. Tompkins have been modernized and his story has been extended. As time goes on, he continues to attend the Professor's lectures and also marries the Professor's daughter, who also has an interest in science. Modern discoveries such as quarks and superstrings are explained, and the book also shows how an accelerator (""atom smasher"") works. A really fun, informational read!"
17,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22085808-e-l-k-y,4,"Many of those ""bring science closer"" books are written in same way of trying to explain basic rules of the universe to people who did not get it on the first time or never heared of it. Mr. Tompson skips the neccessary funny and comes in terms of novel which on it's way happens to make you lagh but story it contains makes it easier to use your fanatasy and therefore remember given rules. "
18,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/910739-ben,5,"This is all about modern physics. There is so much out there on the topic, but I find most books unclear ... especially if you don't already know the material. This is a delightful book that really helps the reader get a handle on mind-bending physics. Still not a light read. Probably should have given it 4 stars, but I really want people to read it."
19,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876353-john-p,4,"A very enjoyable book. I don't much care for the 'love story' subplot, but I guess the author figured he must 'dumb down' the topics to appeal more to a general readership.The parts about the effects of increasing Planck's constant and about shrinking the size of the universe were my favorites. The (too detailed) discussion of all the varieties of subatomic particles and forces, not so much."
20,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34950088-ravi-jain,4,"A great book explaining science concepts which most people find difficult to comprehend, in a very innovative way. Though the lecture chapters get little boring mostly because you wont understand most of it, i would recommend this to high school people. "
21,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4208924-fred,5,Great update on the original.
22,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36834336-nitthilan-k,5,Probably the best introduction to relativity ever. Written in simple words and makes the reading fun. Had a fun ride by reading this books
23,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58113-nathan-letwory,5,"A very nice introduction into the world of relativity theory, quantum physics and such in the form of a novel. A worthwhile read even if you have already the knowledge on these issues."
24,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20918715-chenglu-jin,5,Learn some basic idea about the physics in last century 
25,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12036745-matt-young,5,"This book conveys key topics from Classical to Quantum Physics in an almost childish way. And that's a good thing. Good primer. And bonus, there is absolutely no math involved."
26,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2265301-robin,5," This book provides an interesting view of many hard to understand physics theories and facts. Amazingly clear, creative, and a great read altogether, this book is a one of a kind. "
27,0521639921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/387706-anome,2,"The chief problem with this book is the way it has been updated. While applauding the ideas behind some of the changes, they end up as an almost patronising exercise."
