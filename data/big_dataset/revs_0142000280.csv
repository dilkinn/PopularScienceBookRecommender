0,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/836124-hannah,2,"I like reading about organizing my life and being more productive, but I think the major lessons of this book could have been condensed in a page or two. Here are the things I remember:- 2 minute rule: if you remember to do something and it takes you less than two minutes to do it, just go ahead and do it- write things down in lists so that they don't float around your head and nag at you all of the time- check your lists frequently and often, actually doing the things on the list (or delegating them, or archiving the info), otherwise you will lose faith in the system and it will never work- get a filing cabinet, label-maker, and shredder; create a simple filing system and use your filing system often- ""tickler system"" is a series of files for each day of the year. You file stuff away to be reminded or ""tickled"" on that specific day (i.e. magazine subscription renewal, buying tickets to a play, etc)"
1,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,4,"Ironically, looking in to the GTD (Getting Things Done) system has been bouncing around in the back of my head as something to do for quite some time now. This approach to maximizing productivity is popular among the nerdegalian, probably because of its minimum bullshit approach to actually processing, classifying, and executing what the author David Allen calls ""stuff to do."" This book discusses the GTD system in its entirety and, more importantly, teaches you how to put it in place.What I really liked about Allen's work is that it's very straight forward and focused on implementation. It seems like other self-help books in this vein that I've perused are all about inspiration, defining values, motivating yourself, getting in touch with your inner being and letting loose the full potential of you. To those authors I'd like to say the following: No. Stop it. I don't need nor want that, so you can cram it with walnuts, buddy. GTD, in comparison, is prescriptive. Allen gets touchy-feeling in a few places (such as discussing prioritization or project definition) but the vast majority of the book takes a very practical approach to digging yourself out of whatever mountain of commitments you've gotten yourself under and how to stay on top of it once you get there.In short, GTD focuses on getting ""stuff"" --commitments, to do items, reminders to gather information, requests for information or actions, etc.-- out of your short-term memory and into a physical, highly organized system that will remind you of the right stuff at the right time. Dumping everything out of your short-term memory allows you to do something that's very critical to productivity: focus on one thing at a time. If you're confident that your other commitments or to-dos are safely stored away somewhere and will not be lost or buried out of sight, you can devote all your attention, time, and mental energy to one thing before knocking it out and moving on to the next. I like to think of the system as an artificial, external, and infinitely scalable attention span that you can connect to and disconnect from as needed.That's all well and good, but it's probably not beyond the ken of your average retarded monkey. The tough (and in some places nonintuitive) part is the implementation. Again, there's tons more detail, tricks, and tips in the book, but I'll try to capture the gist of it. There are four major parts to the GTD system: 1. Collecting incoming stuff 2. Processing the stuff 3. Doing the stuff 4. Regularly reviewing your system to make sure your action items and project lists are up to dateCollecting stuff is easy. That's just letting stuff accumulate in your physical or virtual receptacles like inboxes, voice mail, or e-mail.Processing stuff is more involved. It requires sitting down with your inboxes and emptying them. That doesn't mean immediately doing the work associated with each piece of stuff as you pick it up --prioritization is important. It means taking a piece of stuff --an e-mail, a document, a voice mail-- and doing something with it: act on it right then, file it, trash it, delegate it, or create what Allen calls a ""Next Action"" item associated with it. Again, the book is replete with practical tips, hacks, tools, and rules of thumb for deciding which of these things to do and how to keep it all straight. Therein lies some of the book's best value, but it's too detailed to go into here.Doing the stuff is self explanatory, but again I'll emphasize the value of being able to focus on one thing at a time without worrying that other things will be forgotten. It's much more productive and much less stressful.Regularly reviewing your system is also important, and comes in two flavors: as needed and weekly. You may review your action item list (a.k.a., your ""to do list"") several times a day as needed, if for nothing but that endorphin rush that comes with checking things off as ""done"" and deciding what to tackle next. Weekly reviews are also important, and are different in that you take the time to check on your list of active projects and make sure you have a Next Action item for each and every one.So I really like the book and its system. I'd recommend it to anyone who feels like they're not being productive enough or getting buried in work. Allen only gets mushy and non-specific in a few places that make it seem like he's trying to pad the page count, but the majority of the book is specific, direct, and practical. I also like that Allen is in tune with the modern technology that most professionals encounter. He spends appropriate amounts of time discussing things like e-mail, Outlook and voice mail. He also talks about implementing GTD with high-tech tools like PDAs, Web 2.0 systems, and palmtop computers, but while GTD lends itself well to these kinds of toys, at its heart it is technology agnostic. You could do the whole thing quite effectively with a pen, some paper, and a bunch of file folders. Indeed, some parts of the system, like the tickler file work best that way."

I eventually made the decision to never finish it. I think this is self-explanatory.[Later...]Now I'm reading 26 Reasons Not to Use GTD, and it does a good job of articulating the ""ehhhh""ness that I felt while reading this.[Even later...]And if you think GTD's followers are a little cult-like (see, for instance, the comments on this review), check this out: When David Allen says in the acknowledgments ""deepest thanks go to my spiritual coach, J-R"", he's talking about a man named John-Roger ""the Mystical Traveler"", who believes he is a reincarnation of Jesus, St. Francis of Assisi, and Abraham Lincoln. Allen is a minister in his Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness church. Yup."

I learned about GTD from Merlin Mann's 43 Folders site, and became an instant convert. Because I love folders, lists, diagrams, flow charts, of course, but most of all because with GTD, you have to have a labeller. I love my labeller. I love making labels for my files, and admiring them in their serried ranks, all neat and labelly.And I do actually seem to be getting more done, even when I factor in all the time I spend labelling."
4,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,5,"Probably the best self-help book I ever read - in any case the one I most adapted to the organization of my life. It does not have an annoying religious aura to it like 7 Habits or the selfish haberdashery spirit of How to Win Friends and Influence People, but is down to earth and highly practical. I was able to get to Inbox Zero and have held on to that principal for years now. If folks are interested, I can repost here my own adaptation of the techniques. Still for me a reference!My advice: the inbox method is truly important and infinitely helpful. I figured it out and truly feel less overwhelmed and stressed out by email.Step 1Create folders in your various mail programs called_01 TODO - this is for items that take more than 2 min to read and take action on_02 TO READ - these are for things you want to read later: newsletters, long explanatory emails, etc_03 FOLLOWUP - these are things you cannot completed but are waiting on feedback from someone else_04 WAITING FOR - these are actions you cannot complete and require action from someone else_05 TICKLER - projects you don’t have time for, but you want to get around to in the near future_06 UPCOMING TRAVEL - air, car, hotel, tickets for future events and travelStep 2With a free hour ahead of you, go through your inbox and apply the following rules 1. If you can take action on the item in less than 2 minutes, do it  2. Else, sort according to the rules above Step 3Rinse and repeatLet me know how it goes for you :-)"

If such terms instead have you thinking wistfully of the sweet, enveloping darkness to be found at the bottom of your nearest 300-foot drop onto rocky crags, then you have, like me, found yourself woefully living in the wrong universe. You want to be three branes over, where there is still all this awesome new technology and decentralization of art and science and society but nary a hard-charger to be found. In that universe, if someone wants to help others to be more productive, that someone wouldn't expect their readers to slog through a 400-page book that contains about 370 pages of enthusiastic self-congratulation on the startling effectiveness of the method outlined in the remaining 30 pages. Writers in that universe also don't get bored of their own choking newspeak every two paragraphs or so, needing to take a break for a witty and apropos quote, one-sentence summary or reminder of the previous two paragraphs that passed as ephemerally through their own mind as it will through that of the readers, or to just start a new section on either the same or a new topic, either one, it doesn't matter, no one will notice, it's just the same randomly-generated buzzwords bouncing off their eyeballs.However, in that universe as well as our own, the general concept outlined in this book of turning yourself into an automaton of your own design is still valid. Only in that universe when someone wants to get more done in their life by exporting their brain to external resources, it's done matter-of-factly and with little fanfare, since that universe has also failed to create an entire race of creatures that can't figure out how to function without following explicitly outlined methodologies taught to them by highly paid professional consultants. People in that universe have external brains because it's obviously the thing to do, not because it'll make them more effective entrepreneurs, more successful businessmen, more highly admired community leaders not to mention better partners and parents. Half those things aren't taken seriously in this other universe and the other half are taken even less seriously but still done well. There, they learn how to be alive while they're being alive, by being alive, not from a book they read in middle age in desperation after having already failed miserably at living and this is the thing that'll finally get their shit together, I swear to high heaven this is it, for real, everything's gonna be different from here on out. God I wish I was in that universe. "

It was full of useless details (e.g. listing the types of materials out of which an inbox might be made), redundant to the point of making me crazy, and overflowing with multi-step systems for this, that, and the other (seriously, keeping the 3- or 4- or 6-step filters straight would require flashcards).While it had some useful tips, I can't imagine anyone having the free time to implement the system fully. Clearly, though, I am wrong in this, just google ""getting things done"" or ""gtd"" and check out the millions of results. "
7,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253531-jarrodtrainque,0,"With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, ""flow,""""mind like water,"" and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance./ Not quite. Yes, Getting Things Done offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24//7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible Fast Company has dubbed ""the personal productivity guru,"" suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)/ As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant ""in-basket""/ That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). --Timothy Murphy/"
8,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1244228-josh,5,"I have not had much success applying strategies from productivity gurus. I am referring to books like ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Steven Covey, and other books which share use top-down strategies to order our lives. There are two reasons why these have not worked for me. The first is technical: day-to-day life happens on the level of ""stuff"". The myriad of small tasks of varying importance and in multiple contexts hampers the effectiveness of top-down approaches. The second reason is a personal one. The entire mindset of these books is very unappealing to me. Books which simplify and systemize our entire lives, such as Covey's books, seem to suck the imagination and life right out of living. Peter Pan would barf and toss these books to his crocodile buddy.Incredibly, one productivity book has managed to overcome my objections: David Allen's ""Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"" has succeeded where other books failed. ""Getting Things Done"" (from now on I'll refer to it as GTD) has made quite a splash since its release in 2001. It's influence is already pervasive and some of the most useful blogs on the internet swear by it. I probably see it randomly mentioned every week. So for anyone who doesn't know much about it, I'd like to summarize the book and at the same time show how beneficial Allen's method has been for me.First of all, GTD is not a top-down approach. Allen explains that ""...most people are so embroiled in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger horizon is seriously impaired. Consequently, a bottom-up approach is usually more effective."" Allen is dead on. I already do plenty of big-picture thinking, and it really hasn't helped me deal with the nitty-gritty details of whatever messy projects and tasks are on my plate. Allen admits that a lot of times what is needed are a few tricks. GTD has equipped me to better deal with my responsibilities, and in some cases gave me some trick that helped make all the difference.The second problem I've had with productivity books is more complex. I believe it is important to maintain a little bit of a child-like disposition in life. My impressions of the professional world are that it creates uniformity and kills creativity. It's very easy to figure out where my attitudes come from: I grew up watching Mary Poppins and Peter Pan, and Peter Pan was the first ""big book"" that I owned and read. I think I got that book out of my grandpa's library after his funeral. Both of these stories portray growing up as a very dangerous thing to do, and I've never stopped worrying that I will become old, dry, boring, and bored. But whether I like it or not, life happens, and responsibilities accumulate. And here is how ""Getting Things Done"" succeeds where others fail: without wasting time suggesting a cookie-cutter pattern for my life, it aids in conquering mundane tasks and responisibilities so that my energy can return to the activities that excite me. As I've implemented Allen's method, I've found myself able to mentally relax and in general am feeling a lot more creative again. That's pretty much fantastic!Here is a quick summary of the GTD method. Allen describes a five-stage workflow: collecting anything that commands our attention, processing, organizing the results, reviewing the options, and taking action. Going through these steps for the first time is a huge project; Allen suggests taking several days to do this. It took me quite awhile to get all the papers and ""open-loops"" collected or written down, and several hours of work to organize them. Fortunately, Allen does plenty of hand-holding through this. If someone as absent minded and flighty as myself can do it, anyone can. Allen also includes chapters on developing and tracking projects (really excellent stuff) and deciding what to do next at any given moment. As a manual, it is very well written. It gives brief overviews of everything before going into greater detail. By the time you are implementing it, you already have a decent grasp of the material.Allen sold me in the early chapters, so I dived in with both feet. It took awhile, but the results are wonderful. I have no loose unorganized papers anywhere. Before I did GTD, my mind felt like it was completely in knots. It's felt that way for years. Now that I don't carry the anxiety of lots of unidentified mental baggage and millions of unsorted papers, my mind feels relaxed and focused. GTD also helps me keep a clear picture of any tasks in front of me, and it's much easier to decide what to do next. Tackling a ""next action"" list feels a bit like a game. I hope to get one down to zero someday. I am more productive and am feeling more energetic. The method is also somewhat flexible: everyone's implementation will vary a bit. I use a clipboard with next-action divded by context, big wallets to hold file folders in place of a file cabinet, basic office supplies, a paper calendar, and four trays for ""inbox"", ""next action / outbox"", ""data entry"" (for business cards and such), and ""waiting for"". Very low tech, which is how I like it.Only time will tell what effect all this will have on me. Increased responsibilities will be the real test of GTD's effectiveness. Although GTD will hold special appeal to workaholics and productivity worshippers, it is potentially beneficial to anyone who struggles to keep track of all the little tasks we need to get done. Check it out!"

10,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,5,"Time-ManagementThis is the best Self-Help Productivity book ever written. Well, I think so and I’ve been using it for 13 years. It has had such a profound impact on my working life that to this day, it is a part of my daily practice. I have the GTD apps on my phones and tablets, and it is a default webpage I load automatically in my browser. The greatest fear we have when we’re dealing with so many projects or issues or people is that item that we forget because our brain is maxed out with everything else that is flying at us. We need to get it out of our heads and into a trusted system so we can function clearly – today’s modern technology makes this easier. Plug for Toodledo.I have read the typical time management books and if I hear the ‘big rocks first’ story one more time I’ll hurl one of them at someone. What struck home with me in this book was the recognition of things constantly coming our way throughout the day and more than probably from our bosses, or customers who don’t take kindly to being considered anything but a large rock. This book, therefore, deals with a very pragmatic and defined workflow for managing things we need to get done and understanding the priority. The workflow proffered here is 1. Collect 2. Process 3. Organise 4. Review. The book is well written with a style that is easy to read and provides margin notes and images where appropriate. He tends to use bullet points and flowcharts which help illustrate important concepts. If you can take on-board just some of his concepts you’ll notice the difference immediately.I would highly recommend this book and process for managing the To-Dos in your life."
11,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"This is one of those optimistic books in which YOU THE READER can gain control by your own unaided (well almost unaided, you are meant to delegate) efforts, and which doesn't take account of that your workflow might very well be determined by things entirely outside of your control.Not to mention if your working space isn't under your control at all (for example with hot desking) or is very limited (if you are in a drone-zone) then physically some of the ideas here will be impossible. And of course everything in this book is best suited to someone with a secretary or personal assistant.But there are some practical bits and pieces to take away, I've found it useful to not just write a to-do list but also to write by each item what I'm waiting on or what has to be done next to progress the item and the book inspired me to use the email calender feature to pop up reminders of things to do and people to chase.Beware however, just because you can deal with something within two minutes doesn't mean that you should do so!For an absolutely different vision of how a business can work its worth reading Toyota Production System Beyond Large-Scale Production or anything by W. Edwards Deming.In a wider context this is an entirely depressing and soul destroyingly negative book. It's implicit message is that the modern corporate workplace is a meat mincer. Fresh employees are thrown in at one end, the dead and burnt out, ground down and generally used up ones removed and thrown out on to the scrap heap. A functional view of the workplace might be so bold as to posit that people are employed to do a task which contributes towards the achievement of the overall goals and objectives of the organisation. Allen is writing for readers you have experienced something that is very different, in their world nobody cares. If you are struggling to deal with the task you have been employed to do, nobody will notice let alone step in to assist. Your only possible salvation is the life raft of books like this one, offering salvation from the threatening seas of an unlimited workload. Of peculiar interest is that the book is pitched to persons relatively senior - senior enough that they have secretaries or personal assistants. Bizarrely in Allen's world one is appointed to do a job, but there is no reliable way of knowing if you can cope with it or indeed if the job as defined by the organisation can be done by a single person, nor despite the money spent on the employee and their Personal assistant will anybody check or exercise oversight over one's performance.The workplace in Allen's vision is not rational but the site of a particularly lawless gold-rush. Interestingly to my view enough purchasers agree with him to keep him out of the hamster wheel.Like so many 'business' books it ought to be an A4 or A5 laminated card rather than a book hundreds of pages long but apparently there is no money to be made from people in a hurry or who are struggling to achieve stress free productivity."

Allen talks about the 20,000/50,000 foot view, but without enough detail on how to accomplish these.I'd recommend reading through a summary instead of the whole book. There are people who explain Allen's system better than Allen."
15,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1091983-josh,5,"Before I justify the five-star rating, there are a couple of qualifications:1. This book is written toward a certain audience: well-to-do people, mostly business executives, mostly men, mostly older. The large majority of examples mentioned are male corporate leaders. There is the occasional nod to a housewife using the system to get her chores done (I kid you not), and a single reference that I can remember to someone whose work is purely creative. I feel that if you know this coming in, it will be easier to peel the husk and get to the tasty nougat center. 2. The system advocated here will not help you with amorphous creative projects. If you're a writer, Allen offers nothing in the way of how to parcel out a book into attackable chunks and bang out the pages. What it MIGHT do is help you get a clean brain in order to venture into the fog with confidence. If you're the kind of person who has a hard time focusing on creative work because less-important undone projects are nagging at you, this is a great system.I usually dislike business books for exactly the reasons above. But what Allen does is something more applicable to knowledge workers in general. He recognizes that the amount of potential work is infinite, and then says, ""Okay, you'll never get it ALL done. Let's talk about how you can at least put everything in its place, so you can feel good about what you're NOT doing."" It's way simple, and after using the system for about a month, I can say that it's way effective, at least for me. The essence of Allen's strategy is this: Develop a method for capturing everything you have to do in your life on an ongoing basis, periodically break it all down into actionable steps, arrange those actions in order, and then go to town on them. Let's say you realize one day that you need to get a new computer. In practice it means you should write down ""get a new computer"" in a central repository, and then your brain should be doing something like this:""Okay, I need a new computer. But first I need to figure out whether I'm getting a Mac or a PC. My friend Dana has a Mac and loves to talk about it. My next action on this should be to call Dana."" It was a transformative experience to sit down with all the clutter in my life and break it down into next actions. Last night, I strung my guitar because it finally rose up to the top my big list of things to do. Right now I'm taking the time to write a review of this book because I feel on top of all the other things in my life. I am confident that writing this review is the best thing I could be doing at this exact moment. For the first time I can remember, the miscellaneous open loops in my life are not tugging at my attention. I've closed the ones I can close, and I'm okay with the ones I haven't closed yet. I'll get to them when it's time.In short, if you're a creative person who has any kind of outside commitments (i.e., you don't get to lounge about all day writing or painting or watching the stars), then GTD may be a way to give yourself a clean mental slate when you want to do personal creative work.

16,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274099-ruben,4,"I'm really glad my wife and I read this book together. It's already been very helpful in getting us to look at the reason so many things never get done on time or sometimes not at all. The book is well written. The writing is very clear, with lots of examples, though it's a bit dry in the middle and a little flowery on the ends. (That sounds like a description of a scone or something.) We're still working on getting our system set up (I mean filing cabinets for reference material) so I might need to add more to this in a month's time. I'll let you know then if we're getting more things done. As a matter of fact, that's one test to see whether things are still slipping through the cracks. Read, go!Update: one month later, I can say that I do feel less stressed about things, and I'm getting things done like never before. Mind you, I'm not perfect, but I feel there's been a noticeable upswing in how aware I am of what needs to get done. Just having an organized filing cabinet and inbox and next actions list allows me to see at a glance the things that used to just float around my mind, fighting for attention. My wife and I look forward to our weekly review (Sunday nights at 7:30), when we get to go over every project and make sure that everything's on track. I've been implementing this system in my classroom, too, and that helps with the stacks and stacks of papers I collect as a teacher. I'd love to find some way to teach this to my high school students, who can never remember to do their homework or study for tests. Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

Felt pretty good to leave that last day, right?David Allen teaches you how to live your life this way: take all your to-dos, projects, etc. then organize them out into Projects, Next Actions, Someday/Maybe projects, Read and Review, and more if you want. Take the Next Actions and either do them, defer them, delegate them, and/or delete them. It's really that logical and that simple. Now, make a weekly habit of reviewing all those categories. Now you're ""GTD"".Just like it ought to, the book starts out broad, then each chapter goes into more detail of the system. Unless you're some crazy detail-loving mogul, you only need to read about to the half-way mark. I went a bit further just because I loved it so much. For about three weeks now, it's worked for me both at work and more loosely at home. The chapter on organizing your email and keeping your inbox empty is BRILLIANT! If you want to see this book in action, I'll show you my email and desk. I recommend this book to just about everyone.Read the first chapter. I probably only buy 3-4 books a year -- usually because the library doesn't own it, but I bought this one after reading the first chapter in the library's copy. I knew I'd want my own."

Turns out there's a GTD cult to go with the book, it's SO popular. The book is all practical, all realism. It has nothing to do with thinking about your goals; it leaves that up to you. It's all about how to organize your stuff and your lists to get them done.It's been criticized for being both too general and too detailed, but the generality accommodates complexity, and the details are an essential component of the system.On the whole, I'm a fan. If I weren't already pretty tooled up with mental, emotional, and practical productivity skills, I would not think it worthy of the cult. I don't think it comprehensive enough to be a sole source of a system. What I got out of it was an essential suite of concepts that really filled the gaps in my process, and I'm looking forward to finding more efficiency refinements from it.What was truly life-changing for me, though, was processing all my paper in the prescribed method. My filing system is a functional beauty, and I save SO much time just being able to reach straight for something. THAT was worth every minute."

If I was reviewing the GTD system I'd probably give it 4 stars.This is a book review, though, and while the system may be good, the book is terrible. It's extremely repetitive. I'm convinced the entire 267 pages could be condensed down to less than 10, but I guess nobody would pay $15 for a 10-page leaflet. Having to slog through the huge amount of redundancy made reading this book a real chore. Even the diagrams are repetitive. There are 6 diagrams in the book, and 4 of them are essentially copies of the same diagram!The book also uses a lot of terminology without first defining it. For example he uses the term ""open loop"" all the way through the book, but doesn't define what an open-loop is until about two thirds of the way through. He also uses normal words like ""project"", but about half way through the book he explains that when he says ""project"" he doesn't mean what everyone else means by ""project"".So overall, the book is poorly organized, poorly written, and chock-full of filler. If you want to learn GTD it would be better to just find a summary of the system on the web (eg: search for ""toodledo Getting Things Done"" for a good example)."
22,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1620789-dillon,4,"Five stars for the content, two or three for the way it was delivered. But I suspect the purpose of this book wasn't to write beautiful prose, so I'll cut it a break.Since this is a book about an organizational system I'll talk a little bit about what I've tried to incorporate and how mine works. Hopefully doing so will help me to become more conscious of how I can improve it. In a former life - a stupider one, I tried to capture everything in my head. This had results ranging from moderate success to catastrophic failure. Considerable stress and a nagging feeling of imminent collapse as my constant companions, and sleep escaped me. While this was all going on, in college I started using a blank Moleskine and OneNote to capture more of my thoughts, but still stayed mostly disorganized. At this point I don't think I used either the Moleskine or OneNote very well, and I was still mismanaging my time and thus losing sleep just to keep up. When I got a Mac, before OneNote came out for OSX, I migrated to Evernote for my personal and church things. When I started my current job, I started using Evernote for that as well. Once Evernote decided to charge for cross-device access, I jumped back to OneNote, which was now supported on Mac (the irony is that I don't even use the same OneNote account on more than one device). I use OneNote to keep track of daily to-dos and to keep me accountable to my workday schedule. This change was fairly recent (only barely outside of the past six months, I think) - and it's been evolving since I started with it. It started with just a blank sheet as I would use in college, but then I added daily to-dos, and most recently I added a schedule and weekly to-dos (less specific than the dailies).So for my part, I really like the system he outlines and have made efforts to incorporate it into my own workday and outside-of-work calendar. I particularly like the ""next actions"" concept (I felt like this was half the book) - clearly defining what needs to be done rather than vague ""stuff"" that need to be checked off. This corresponds to my to-do list - it's not a list of projects, but concrete actions. I will try to organize tasks concretly more consciously from now on. Outside of work, I'm not sure that my life is busy enough to warrant organizing ""next actions"" by any further granularity - I just use a small planner for my personal life - though this could be because I haven't captured everything. I also like the idea of having a ""waiting for"" bucket - this was a huge gap in my organizational system and I've added it to my OneNote template. In the short time I've been practicing it, the offloading of mental burdens to an ""external brain"" has been hugely liberating for me. Like he says, one of the biggest humps to overcome is the ""capturing"" phase - for me, if I'm sure I captured everything that needs to be done in a day and the next, I can rest much easier. Also, having the weekly review is a great concept. Without periodic reviews, how can I know if I'm on track or not?We'll see. I'm still in the nascent phase of developing my own organization, but this book has been helpful for me to develop a better framework and ""mind like water"" (I always think of Bruce Lee when he mentioned that phrase in the book). So he had my attention the first time he brought it up.All the good things aside, this book felt much longer than it needed to be - at least from what I took away I think it could have been covered succinctly in five or so chapters, rather than 15. The unnecessary length took away from rather than added to the book - it felt somewhat repetitive and the purpose of one chapter wasn't very clearly distinguishable from the next. Also, the author's face is on the cover and from a distance he looks like another, more famous David (Letterman) - was this a clever marketing ploy to get people to hear what Dave Letterman has to say? If so I'd like to express my disapproval. If not, it's still unusual."

24,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"A colleague recommended this book to me because I was seeing an adult client with ADHD. He also shared that he used the principles in this book to run a skills-teaching group for teens with ADHD, and that he uses this system himself. This recommendation came at a time when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and overloaded at work, so I figured I would try to see if there was anything here that I could adopt so as to better inform my client about how it works while engaging in my own self-improvement.According to David Allen, we feel overwhelmed and distracted because we have too many commitments on our minds rather than taking action on them and/or filing them away in a system where we can revisit them as needed. These commitments remain in the category of unfinished business, or ""open loops,"" which torture us and stress us out because we haven't figured out how to get rid of them. The first step, says Allen, is to take all the things we're supposed to be doing and collect them into a small number of physical or virtual in-baskets (e.g., a wire tray that sits on your desk plus your e-mail inbox). The number of receptacles for collecting unfinished business should be small, and the information in them needs to be processed regularly.Processing involves going through the items, one by one, and deciding what the next action step is on these items. Although it seems obvious, lots of stuff we need to do stays in never-never land because we never figure out, concretely, what the next step is. Sometimes there is no next step, in which case the item should either be trashed or filed (as reference, or as something to be taken care of at a later date). If there is a next step, you need to decide whether to do it (if it can be done in 2 minutes or less), delegate it (if someone else can do it), or defer it. Deferring an item may include placing it onto a category list, e.g., ""calls,"" ""at computer,"" ""errands,"" ""at office,"" ""at home,"" ""agendas"" (for people and meetings), or ""read/review."" You should also keep a list of your ongoing multi-step projects, to be reviewed weekly, with ""next steps"" categorized into the above categories. Another system is a ""tickler file"" for things that need to be done on certain days. The tickler file is a drawer full of file folders that is subdivided into months of the year, with a file folder for each day on the calendar. This allows you to file tasks that will be done on days other than today. Your calendar is used only to mark appointments; if you clutter it with task reminders, it will get overwhelming.Once everything you have to do is thus organized, you start each day by looking at your calendar to get a sense of your appointments and what windows of time you have in between. You then review your tickler file for that day and your general lists of next actions (e.g., calls to make, things to do at the computer, errands, etc.) to think about what can be done today, where, and when. There's also the issue of choosing which actions to take in the moment, which involves evaluating your context (e.g., are you near a phone? are you near your computer? are you in the car and available for errands?), time available, energy available, and priority (i.e., out of all the options you could take now in this context, with this amount of time and energy available, which is the most important?). Another important aspect of this system is the weekly review. A time and place must be set aside once a week to gather loose papers and put them in the in-basket for processing, process any notes, action items, etc., review past calendar dates for actionable items, review upcoming calendar dates, document and categorize all open loops and their next actions, review project lists and evaluate what needs to be done, review next action lists, and review any additional checklists.Basically, this book felt like FLYlady for the office. It was an interesting experience for me, because whereas I can be a total slob at home and found FLYlady invaluable for working on changing that (with admittedly inconsistent commitment and progress on my part), I'm actually pretty on top of things at work for the most part. Although I wasn't formally following David Allen's system, I was intuitively using some of his ideas and applying them in my own way. That being said, I found many of his suggestions quite useful and even went out and bought myself a four-tiered tray to keep on my desk for in-box, processing, and out-box. This small change was surprisingly helpful and went a long way toward increasing my sense of control over what I have to do and decreasing my overwhelm. I also think that, for people who are struggling with staying on top of all the things they have to do, this system could be very helpful. But like any system, you need to be committed to following it. Sometimes, it comes down to whether you'd rather stress over making sure to take all your preventative steps to stay on top of things, or stress over having to scramble. I think that adults who struggle with ADHD could consider trying this system out and seeing if it works for them. But I know that aspects of the system, and even the system as a whole, have been helpful for individuals without a diagnosis who simply want a system that keeps them organized."

I decided to investigate further a little while back, and finally picked up the book two weeks ago. And now I've read it; and I expect I'll go back and re-read this book in a couple months. I may revise my rating at that time.The things that irritate me in this book are exactly the things I expected might irritate me. There are plenty of the obligatory breezy anecdotes about the clients Allen has worked with and how impressed they were with the system; the margins of every page are filled with quotes; there are lapses into business motivation jargon; and there are numbered lists in droves. I skimmed some parts. But at the same time, there is something I didn't really expect: very concrete advice about organizational tricks and tactics, introduced with the words ""let me assure you that a lot of the value people get from this material is good 'tricks.'"" Recognizable meat! No wonder there are so many technical readers who have latched on to this guy.Of course, I still have to see whether I can get the meat to work for me.

27,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5050038-amy,1,"Oy, this guy.If you are a disorganized mess, his book does not have enough step-by-step to help you. If you have a hint of what you're doing, he is quite vague with no actual hands-on tips.Here are his main ideas:-- Your mind is always keeping a running to-do list in the background while you're doing other things. This noise distracts you from what you're doing and makes you feel worried that you should be doing something on that list. Shut out the running to-do list and you can focus on one thing at a time.-- So, empty your head of every to-do, every thought and keep it all in one place. Write one idea on a piece of paper and scribble sub-ideas on the same sheet of paper.-- Decide on what to do and when. Decide on the next action for each major thought and write it down.-- Make a master to-do list and parse it out based on areas of your life (business/personal, calls vs writing, etc.)-- Have your assistant/secretary do a lot of the remembering for you and remind you (oh, wow, that works so well for us peons)-- Oh, and clear off your cluttered mess of a desk. It's mentally distracting you and see point two of gathering up every piece of information laying around.Sound like new ideas? That's because they're not. The whole thing reads like an advert for his consulting business because he gives you just enough information to feel like you don't know what you're doing but not enough concrete tasks to actually get to work. Pretty ironic for a productivity guy. Unless he's trying to drive up the productivity of his consultancy. One more thing -- the guy doesn't even recommend e-mail filters as a time-saver.

This is essentially a 300-page book about managing to-do lists. That should either exhilarate you or cause you to roll your eyes. Depending on which one you are, you either pick this up or stop reading this review. The advice in the book has stood the test of time, but don't expect him to recommend you any system (rather, attributes of one). The main insights for me:* If you are procrastinating an item it's probably because it's not clearly describing the next action. E.g. ""Apply for Canadian citizenship"" is a terrible task. Split it into the 20 tasks that actually requires: ""Get passport photo taken"", ""Fill out travel history for the past 5 years"", ""Find a good source of information for the Canadian history test"" and so on.* If there's more than two tasks associated with something and it takes less than a year to complete it's a project, not a task--a feature most to-do applications support.* Tag everything based on: energy, context, deadline, and time to complete. If you have these tags properly organized, you know what you can do when you're in a waiting room on your phone (low energy, mobile context, and 5 min or less time to complete). If you don't know what's highest priority where you are right now, your system is not serving its function.* Thinking ""about"" things cause stress. If you think about something and it's in your system, you should be able to immediately dismiss it. Put everything in there.* You cannot run a proper to-do system if you don't review all tasks once a week.* If a task takes less than two minutes, just do it now, the graphs cross of system overhead and cost of doing it immediately just around here.* If you don't trust your system, you need to do a complete dump of everything in your life that needs to get done. The book has multiple-page ""triggers"" to make sure everything in your life is captured.If you've ever opened ""Things"" and had no idea what to do, this book is for you. I've used Things for many years, but find now that I am lacking some power and now consider switching to OmniFocus as a result of reading this book.

34,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "

Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"
41,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597186-rada,5,"This was a re-read, I first read this book some 15yrs ago. I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"
42,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040319-denar,4,"Well well well, David's got a point. Stressing out won't get things done, you gotta organize and approach it systematically. I like his analogy of big and small stones falling in water. My key take away is his vertical and horizontal approach to sorting tasks, reminds me of Asana for some reason. Anyways, highly recommended for people who are under a lot of load."

I almost gave up many times, and ended up skimming through a lot of it. It’s so repetitive and there was so much irrelevant information for me.

If you have a friend or colleague that uses the system, I would suggest to start by talking to that person and learning the basics from there, maybe you don’t even need to read the book, really...it’s not that I’m not grateful for all the work that has been done to come up with the system and write the book, I really am.

I learned them through blog posts and other people without being aware that they are of GTD. Some of them I discovered myself, simply because they made sense.The principles of GTD - essential. The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
45,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "
46,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755874-peter,4,"I went through parts of this book/lecture series when I was an undergrad, but am revisiting the audiobook now. It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

It was quite hard work to read, perhaps because I only wanted to read it as fast as I was putting things into practice -- and so it has taken me about 3 years to read it all the way through!! The key ideas have been a) collecting and recording every single input into a trusted system of lists etc b) the 2 minute rule (deal with it immediately if it takes less than 2 minutes) c) the ""Next Action"": never record somthing in vague terms, instead define exactly what needs to be done next. I haven't implemented the whole David Allen system, but it's still proving helpful. One of the best things was that every time I read a chapter it motivated me to be very productive for about a day!"
48,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87050-andrew-horton,2,"While David Allen has a lot of great ideas and the concept of applying a massive productivity program to your life is appealing, the entire book can essentially be summed up as ""1. Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

Mind like water, Grasshopper. I've recommended this book to several people who felt overwhelmed at their jobs and they've all loved it.

55,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
56,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
57,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."

It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

It revolutionized the way I view time management and allows me to accomplish an incredible amount of things in my life. Not that my life is perfect or that I am perfect!!! There are plenty of unproductive days in my life! But when I am following this system, I can literally have 150 things on my to do lists and still feel in control of things and be relaxed and calm. Part of the reason why I'm sure I'll top 150 books this year on top of being a wife, mom, homeschooling 2 children, being a gymnastics meet director, volunteering at our church, traveling a lot (we took a total of 9 trips last year), keeping up with all the housework, organizing lots of activities and trips for other homeschooling families and keeping up with the other dozens of life details, is because Getting Things Done.

Quotes :-------""Not emptying your in-basket is like having garbage cans that nobody has dumped. You just have to keep buying new ones to hold all your trash.""""I recommend that you create a Someday Maybe List... Give yourself permission to populate that list with all the items of that type... You'll probably discover that simply having the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all sorts of creative ideas. You might also be surprised to find that some of the things you write on the list will actually come to pass, almost without your having to make any conscious effort to make them happen.""""We're likely to seize opportunities when they arise if we've already identified and captured them as a probability.""""Your system cannot be static."" ""What most people don't realize is that my lists are, in one sense, my office.""""What is the weekly review? Very simply, the weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again. The weekly review is so critical that it behooves you to establish good habits, environments, and tools to support it. Once your comfort zone has been established for the kind of related control that Getting Things Done is all about, you won't have to worry too much about making yourself do your review - you'll have to get back to your personal standards again.""""Where did the not-so-good feelings come from? Too much to do? No, there's always too much to do... It comes from a different place. How have you felt when someone broke an agreement with you? What are all those things in your in-basket? Agreements you've made with yourself.""""... Every agreement must be made conscious - that is, it must be captured, objectified, and reviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so that you can put it where it belongs... If that doesn't happen, it will take up much more psychic energy than it deserves.""""If [the mind] is only focusing on one thing at a time without distraction, you'll be in your zone. I suggest you use your mind to think about things rather than think of them. You want to be adding value as you think about projects and people, not simply reminding yourself that they exist.""""There's a great difference however between making that decision when things show up and doing it when they blow up.""""I learned this simple but extraordinary ""Next Action"" technique 20 years ago from a long-time friend and management consulting mentor of mine, Dean Aitchison... One day he just started picking up each individual piece of paper on an executive's desk and forcing him to decide what the very next thing he had to do was to move it forward. The results were so immediate and so profound for the executive that Dean continued for years to perfect the methodology using that same question to process the in-basket.""""What's ironic is that it would likely require only about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.""""We are all already powerful. But deciding on and effectively managing the physical actions required to move things forward seems to exercise that power...

Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "
65,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125642-dan-weaver,3,"The author is more productivity than man now, and it's a shame because you'd think that someone who gets paid to help corporate executives go through their backlogs of paperwork would have an anonymizable dirty secret or two to spill, or at least a sense of humor. There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years.

69,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358209-scott-dinsmore,5,"Why You Should Read It: Time is the only real scarce resource. We are all battling for more of it. The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I’m a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity “ah-ha’s” as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I’m excited to implement a few more of Allan’s nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. “What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?” This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"

I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"
72,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040319-denar,4,"Well well well, David's got a point. Stressing out won't get things done, you gotta organize and approach it systematically.

The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
75,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "
76,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755874-peter,4,"I went through parts of this book/lecture series when I was an undergrad, but am revisiting the audiobook now. It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

85,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"

It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."

Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."

It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

You just have to keep buying new ones to hold all your trash.""""I recommend that you create a Someday Maybe List... Give yourself permission to populate that list with all the items of that type... You'll probably discover that simply having the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all sorts of creative ideas. You might also be surprised to find that some of the things you write on the list will actually come to pass, almost without your having to make any conscious effort to make them happen.""""We're likely to seize opportunities when they arise if we've already identified and captured them as a probability.""""Your system cannot be static."" ""What most people don't realize is that my lists are, in one sense, my office.""""What is the weekly review? Very simply, the weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again. The weekly review is so critical that it behooves you to establish good habits, environments, and tools to support it. Once your comfort zone has been established for the kind of related control that Getting Things Done is all about, you won't have to worry too much about making yourself do your review - you'll have to get back to your personal standards again.""""Where did the not-so-good feelings come from? Too much to do? No, there's always too much to do... It comes from a different place. How have you felt when someone broke an agreement with you? What are all those things in your in-basket?

Every agreement must be made conscious - that is, it must be captured, objectified, and reviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so that you can put it where it belongs...

One day he just started picking up each individual piece of paper on an executive's desk and forcing him to decide what the very next thing he had to do was to move it forward. The results were so immediate and so profound for the executive that Dean continued for years to perfect the methodology using that same question to process the in-basket.""""What's ironic is that it would likely require only about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.""""We are all already powerful.

94,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "
95,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125642-dan-weaver,3,"The author is more productivity than man now, and it's a shame because you'd think that someone who gets paid to help corporate executives go through their backlogs of paperwork would have an anonymizable dirty secret or two to spill, or at least a sense of humor. There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years.

99,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358209-scott-dinsmore,5,"Why You Should Read It: Time is the only real scarce resource. We are all battling for more of it. The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I’m a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity “ah-ha’s” as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I’m excited to implement a few more of Allan’s nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. “What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?” This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"

The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content.

105,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "

It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

115,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
116,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
117,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."
118,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31712855-acordul-fin,2,"I do think that some of his ideas are useful (like how important it is to clarify what your goal/project/commitment is and then write down the first physical actions you need to take to complete it), but, quoting another reviewer, the book is ""profoundly American"". It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

It revolutionized the way I view time management and allows me to accomplish an incredible amount of things in my life. Not that my life is perfect or that I am perfect!!! There are plenty of unproductive days in my life! But when I am following this system, I can literally have 150 things on my to do lists and still feel in control of things and be relaxed and calm. Part of the reason why I'm sure I'll top 150 books this year on top of being a wife, mom, homeschooling 2 children, being a gymnastics meet director, volunteering at our church, traveling a lot (we took a total of 9 trips last year), keeping up with all the housework, organizing lots of activities and trips for other homeschooling families and keeping up with the other dozens of life details, is because Getting Things Done.

This book doesnt offer quick recipies, shortcuts or things-to-do list.You can not find valuable information by skimming the book. This book is all about understanding and applying the ""whole system"". By reading is quickly or just by skimming it you will not get the essence of the book. You only remember 2 minute rule, capture, filing or project list etc. Also, you cannot even get the crux of the book by listening to YouTube summaries or presentations. You must read the book again and again until it becomes the part of your understanding. The first sign of getting most out the book is you feel frustrated and overwhelmed. I think it is worth it. I would say it is the bible of productivity. Just like bible different thing resonate at different time and differently to different people. You only need to consult it again and again.

You just have to keep buying new ones to hold all your trash.""""I recommend that you create a Someday Maybe List... Give yourself permission to populate that list with all the items of that type... You'll probably discover that simply having the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all sorts of creative ideas. You might also be surprised to find that some of the things you write on the list will actually come to pass, almost without your having to make any conscious effort to make them happen.""""We're likely to seize opportunities when they arise if we've already identified and captured them as a probability.""""Your system cannot be static."" ""What most people don't realize is that my lists are, in one sense, my office.""""What is the weekly review? Very simply, the weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again. The weekly review is so critical that it behooves you to establish good habits, environments, and tools to support it. Once your comfort zone has been established for the kind of related control that Getting Things Done is all about, you won't have to worry too much about making yourself do your review - you'll have to get back to your personal standards again.""""Where did the not-so-good feelings come from? Too much to do? No, there's always too much to do... It comes from a different place. How have you felt when someone broke an agreement with you? What are all those things in your in-basket? Agreements you've made with yourself.""""... Every agreement must be made conscious - that is, it must be captured, objectified, and reviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so that you can put it where it belongs... If that doesn't happen, it will take up much more psychic energy than it deserves.""""If [the mind] is only focusing on one thing at a time without distraction, you'll be in your zone. I suggest you use your mind to think about things rather than think of them. You want to be adding value as you think about projects and people, not simply reminding yourself that they exist.""""There's a great difference however between making that decision when things show up and doing it when they blow up.""""I learned this simple but extraordinary ""Next Action"" technique 20 years ago from a long-time friend and management consulting mentor of mine, Dean Aitchison... One day he just started picking up each individual piece of paper on an executive's desk and forcing him to decide what the very next thing he had to do was to move it forward. The results were so immediate and so profound for the executive that Dean continued for years to perfect the methodology using that same question to process the in-basket.""""What's ironic is that it would likely require only about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.""""We are all already powerful. But deciding on and effectively managing the physical actions required to move things forward seems to exercise that power... Once you make things happen, you really start to believe that you can make things happen.""."
124,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "
125,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125642-dan-weaver,3,"The author is more productivity than man now, and it's a shame because you'd think that someone who gets paid to help corporate executives go through their backlogs of paperwork would have an anonymizable dirty secret or two to spill, or at least a sense of humor. There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years.

129,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358209-scott-dinsmore,5,"Why You Should Read It: Time is the only real scarce resource. We are all battling for more of it. The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I’m a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity “ah-ha’s” as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I’m excited to implement a few more of Allan’s nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. “What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?” This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"

I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"

I like his analogy of big and small stones falling in water. My key take away is his vertical and horizontal approach to sorting tasks, reminds me of Asana for some reason.

I almost gave up many times, and ended up skimming through a lot of it. It’s so repetitive and there was so much irrelevant information for me. I wish I had read a condensed version of it with just the basics, which are not a lot. If you have a friend or colleague that uses the system, I would suggest to start by talking to that person and learning the basics from there, maybe you don’t even need to read the book, really...it’s not that I’m not grateful for all the work that has been done to come up with the system and write the book, I really am. I just don’t think this is the most engaging intro to it..."

I learned them through blog posts and other people without being aware that they are of GTD. Some of them I discovered myself, simply because they made sense.The principles of GTD - essential. The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
135,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "
136,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755874-peter,4,"I went through parts of this book/lecture series when I was an undergrad, but am revisiting the audiobook now. It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

It was quite hard work to read, perhaps because I only wanted to read it as fast as I was putting things into practice -- and so it has taken me about 3 years to read it all the way through!!

Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

144,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4254869-lauren-james,0,"THE BEST. This is just - my entire jam. All about organisation and to do lists, in what is basically a precursor to bullet journalling."
145,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
146,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."

Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."

It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

154,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.)

There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years. An epilogue detailing possible side-effects of his System would be helpful in a future edition."

In the book, Allen outlines fives stages of workflow and shares a system that helps maximize productivity at each of those stages. And even if you read the book and don’t feel like implementing the system, his basic principles – write things down, put them in the place that makes sense, review your lists, find ways to give yourself reminders in context and keep strong walls around your systems – make total sense in other contexts, too. Don’t let the self-helpy cover turn you off; if you want to be more organized and productive, this one is a must read.(From Books to Make You Happy, Productive, Focused, and Smart by Kim Ukura: http://bookriot.com/2014/12/08/books-...)"

159,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358209-scott-dinsmore,5,"Why You Should Read It: Time is the only real scarce resource. We are all battling for more of it. The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I’m a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity “ah-ha’s” as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I’m excited to implement a few more of Allan’s nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. “What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?” This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"

I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"
162,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040319-denar,4,"Well well well, David's got a point. Stressing out won't get things done, you gotta organize and approach it systematically. I like his analogy of big and small stones falling in water. My key take away is his vertical and horizontal approach to sorting tasks, reminds me of Asana for some reason. Anyways, highly recommended for people who are under a lot of load."

If you have a friend or colleague that uses the system, I would suggest to start by talking to that person and learning the basics from there, maybe you don’t even need to read the book, really...it’s not that I’m not grateful for all the work that has been done to come up with the system and write the book, I really am.

I learned them through blog posts and other people without being aware that they are of GTD. Some of them I discovered myself, simply because they made sense.The principles of GTD - essential. The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
165,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "
166,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755874-peter,4,"I went through parts of this book/lecture series when I was an undergrad, but am revisiting the audiobook now. It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

It was quite hard work to read, perhaps because I only wanted to read it as fast as I was putting things into practice -- and so it has taken me about 3 years to read it all the way through!!

Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

Mind like water, Grasshopper. I've recommended this book to several people who felt overwhelmed at their jobs and they've all loved it.

175,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
176,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
177,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."
178,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31712855-acordul-fin,2,"I do think that some of his ideas are useful (like how important it is to clarify what your goal/project/commitment is and then write down the first physical actions you need to take to complete it), but, quoting another reviewer, the book is ""profoundly American"". It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

It revolutionized the way I view time management and allows me to accomplish an incredible amount of things in my life. Not that my life is perfect or that I am perfect!!! There are plenty of unproductive days in my life! But when I am following this system, I can literally have 150 things on my to do lists and still feel in control of things and be relaxed and calm. Part of the reason why I'm sure I'll top 150 books this year on top of being a wife, mom, homeschooling 2 children, being a gymnastics meet director, volunteering at our church, traveling a lot (we took a total of 9 trips last year), keeping up with all the housework, organizing lots of activities and trips for other homeschooling families and keeping up with the other dozens of life details, is because Getting Things Done. Needless to say, I believe this is a must read for everyone. "

This book doesnt offer quick recipies, shortcuts or things-to-do list.You can not find valuable information by skimming the book. This book is all about understanding and applying the ""whole system"". By reading is quickly or just by skimming it you will not get the essence of the book. You only remember 2 minute rule, capture, filing or project list etc. Also, you cannot even get the crux of the book by listening to YouTube summaries or presentations. You must read the book again and again until it becomes the part of your understanding. The first sign of getting most out the book is you feel frustrated and overwhelmed. I think it is worth it. I would say it is the bible of productivity. Just like bible different thing resonate at different time and differently to different people. You only need to consult it again and again. Even the phrase ""getting things done"" got a deep philosophy in it. The only flaw in this book is it is hard to comprehend in its entirety without a coach.

I generally like the rule, but have found it problematic when something else also comes to mind, and I forget what that was within two minutes =) By the time I came to read this, I had already learned many productivity strategies from other books and programs.

Quotes :-------""Not emptying your in-basket is like having garbage cans that nobody has dumped. You just have to keep buying new ones to hold all your trash.""""I recommend that you create a Someday Maybe List... Give yourself permission to populate that list with all the items of that type... You'll probably discover that simply having the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all sorts of creative ideas. You might also be surprised to find that some of the things you write on the list will actually come to pass, almost without your having to make any conscious effort to make them happen.""""We're likely to seize opportunities when they arise if we've already identified and captured them as a probability.""""Your system cannot be static."" ""What most people don't realize is that my lists are, in one sense, my office.""""What is the weekly review? Very simply, the weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again. The weekly review is so critical that it behooves you to establish good habits, environments, and tools to support it. Once your comfort zone has been established for the kind of related control that Getting Things Done is all about, you won't have to worry too much about making yourself do your review - you'll have to get back to your personal standards again.""""Where did the not-so-good feelings come from? Too much to do? No, there's always too much to do... It comes from a different place. How have you felt when someone broke an agreement with you? What are all those things in your in-basket? Agreements you've made with yourself.""""... Every agreement must be made conscious - that is, it must be captured, objectified, and reviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so that you can put it where it belongs... If that doesn't happen, it will take up much more psychic energy than it deserves.""""If [the mind] is only focusing on one thing at a time without distraction, you'll be in your zone. I suggest you use your mind to think about things rather than think of them. You want to be adding value as you think about projects and people, not simply reminding yourself that they exist.""""There's a great difference however between making that decision when things show up and doing it when they blow up.""""I learned this simple but extraordinary ""Next Action"" technique 20 years ago from a long-time friend and management consulting mentor of mine, Dean Aitchison... One day he just started picking up each individual piece of paper on an executive's desk and forcing him to decide what the very next thing he had to do was to move it forward. The results were so immediate and so profound for the executive that Dean continued for years to perfect the methodology using that same question to process the in-basket.""""What's ironic is that it would likely require only about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.""""We are all already powerful. But deciding on and effectively managing the physical actions required to move things forward seems to exercise that power... Once you make things happen, you really start to believe that you can make things happen.""."
184,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "
185,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125642-dan-weaver,3,"The author is more productivity than man now, and it's a shame because you'd think that someone who gets paid to help corporate executives go through their backlogs of paperwork would have an anonymizable dirty secret or two to spill, or at least a sense of humor. There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years. An epilogue detailing possible side-effects of his System would be helpful in a future edition."

189,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358209-scott-dinsmore,5,"Why You Should Read It: Time is the only real scarce resource. We are all battling for more of it. The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I’m a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity “ah-ha’s” as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I’m excited to implement a few more of Allan’s nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. “What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?” This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"

I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"
192,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040319-denar,4,"Well well well, David's got a point. Stressing out won't get things done, you gotta organize and approach it systematically.

The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
195,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "

It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

205,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
206,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
207,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."
208,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31712855-acordul-fin,2,"I do think that some of his ideas are useful (like how important it is to clarify what your goal/project/commitment is and then write down the first physical actions you need to take to complete it), but, quoting another reviewer, the book is ""profoundly American"". It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

It revolutionized the way I view time management and allows me to accomplish an incredible amount of things in my life. Not that my life is perfect or that I am perfect!!! There are plenty of unproductive days in my life! But when I am following this system, I can literally have 150 things on my to do lists and still feel in control of things and be relaxed and calm. Part of the reason why I'm sure I'll top 150 books this year on top of being a wife, mom, homeschooling 2 children, being a gymnastics meet director, volunteering at our church, traveling a lot (we took a total of 9 trips last year), keeping up with all the housework, organizing lots of activities and trips for other homeschooling families and keeping up with the other dozens of life details, is because Getting Things Done.

This book doesnt offer quick recipies, shortcuts or things-to-do list.You can not find valuable information by skimming the book. This book is all about understanding and applying the ""whole system"". By reading is quickly or just by skimming it you will not get the essence of the book. You only remember 2 minute rule, capture, filing or project list etc. Also, you cannot even get the crux of the book by listening to YouTube summaries or presentations. You must read the book again and again until it becomes the part of your understanding. The first sign of getting most out the book is you feel frustrated and overwhelmed. I think it is worth it. I would say it is the bible of productivity. Just like bible different thing resonate at different time and differently to different people. You only need to consult it again and again.

You just have to keep buying new ones to hold all your trash.""""I recommend that you create a Someday Maybe List... Give yourself permission to populate that list with all the items of that type... You'll probably discover that simply having the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all sorts of creative ideas. You might also be surprised to find that some of the things you write on the list will actually come to pass, almost without your having to make any conscious effort to make them happen.""""We're likely to seize opportunities when they arise if we've already identified and captured them as a probability.""""Your system cannot be static."" ""What most people don't realize is that my lists are, in one sense, my office.""""What is the weekly review? Very simply, the weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again. The weekly review is so critical that it behooves you to establish good habits, environments, and tools to support it. Once your comfort zone has been established for the kind of related control that Getting Things Done is all about, you won't have to worry too much about making yourself do your review - you'll have to get back to your personal standards again.""""Where did the not-so-good feelings come from? Too much to do? No, there's always too much to do... It comes from a different place. How have you felt when someone broke an agreement with you? What are all those things in your in-basket? Agreements you've made with yourself.""""... Every agreement must be made conscious - that is, it must be captured, objectified, and reviewed regularly in full conscious awareness so that you can put it where it belongs... If that doesn't happen, it will take up much more psychic energy than it deserves.""""If [the mind] is only focusing on one thing at a time without distraction, you'll be in your zone. I suggest you use your mind to think about things rather than think of them. You want to be adding value as you think about projects and people, not simply reminding yourself that they exist.""""There's a great difference however between making that decision when things show up and doing it when they blow up.""""I learned this simple but extraordinary ""Next Action"" technique 20 years ago from a long-time friend and management consulting mentor of mine, Dean Aitchison... One day he just started picking up each individual piece of paper on an executive's desk and forcing him to decide what the very next thing he had to do was to move it forward. The results were so immediate and so profound for the executive that Dean continued for years to perfect the methodology using that same question to process the in-basket.""""What's ironic is that it would likely require only about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.""""We are all already powerful. But deciding on and effectively managing the physical actions required to move things forward seems to exercise that power...

214,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "
215,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125642-dan-weaver,3,"The author is more productivity than man now, and it's a shame because you'd think that someone who gets paid to help corporate executives go through their backlogs of paperwork would have an anonymizable dirty secret or two to spill, or at least a sense of humor. There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years.

The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I’m a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity “ah-ha’s” as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I’m excited to implement a few more of Allan’s nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. “What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?” This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"

The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content.

225,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "
226,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755874-peter,4,"I went through parts of this book/lecture series when I was an undergrad, but am revisiting the audiobook now. It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

It was quite hard work to read, perhaps because I only wanted to read it as fast as I was putting things into practice -- and so it has taken me about 3 years to read it all the way through!! The key ideas have been a) collecting and recording every single input into a trusted system of lists etc b) the 2 minute rule (deal with it immediately if it takes less than 2 minutes) c) the ""Next Action"": never record somthing in vague terms, instead define exactly what needs to be done next. I haven't implemented the whole David Allen system, but it's still proving helpful. One of the best things was that every time I read a chapter it motivated me to be very productive for about a day!"

Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

234,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4254869-lauren-james,0,"THE BEST. This is just - my entire jam. All about organisation and to do lists, in what is basically a precursor to bullet journalling."
235,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
236,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
237,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."

It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

244,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "

There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years.

Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"
251,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597186-rada,5,"This was a re-read, I first read this book some 15yrs ago. I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"
252,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040319-denar,4,"Well well well, David's got a point. Stressing out won't get things done, you gotta organize and approach it systematically. I like his analogy of big and small stones falling in water. My key take away is his vertical and horizontal approach to sorting tasks, reminds me of Asana for some reason. Anyways, highly recommended for people who are under a lot of load."

I almost gave up many times, and ended up skimming through a lot of it. It’s so repetitive and there was so much irrelevant information for me. I wish I had read a condensed version of it with just the basics, which are not a lot. If you have a friend or colleague that uses the system, I would suggest to start by talking to that person and learning the basics from there, maybe you don’t even need to read the book, really...it’s not that I’m not grateful for all the work that has been done to come up with the system and write the book, I really am. I just don’t think this is the most engaging intro to it..."

I learned them through blog posts and other people without being aware that they are of GTD. Some of them I discovered myself, simply because they made sense.The principles of GTD - essential. The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
255,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "
256,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755874-peter,4,"I went through parts of this book/lecture series when I was an undergrad, but am revisiting the audiobook now. It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

It was quite hard work to read, perhaps because I only wanted to read it as fast as I was putting things into practice -- and so it has taken me about 3 years to read it all the way through!! The key ideas have been a) collecting and recording every single input into a trusted system of lists etc b) the 2 minute rule (deal with it immediately if it takes less than 2 minutes) c) the ""Next Action"": never record somthing in vague terms, instead define exactly what needs to be done next. I haven't implemented the whole David Allen system, but it's still proving helpful. One of the best things was that every time I read a chapter it motivated me to be very productive for about a day!"
258,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87050-andrew-horton,2,"While David Allen has a lot of great ideas and the concept of applying a massive productivity program to your life is appealing, the entire book can essentially be summed up as ""1. Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

259,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7478358-eric-franklin,5,"A book that helps you see your day to day work differently paired with a highly customized system that allows you to exercise control. Mind like water, Grasshopper. I've recommended this book to several people who felt overwhelmed at their jobs and they've all loved it. Just be careful not to take the system too far - the excitement of something that works will have you spending hundreds of dollars playing with various software programs, tweaking your productivity flow.

265,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
266,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
267,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."

It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

It revolutionized the way I view time management and allows me to accomplish an incredible amount of things in my life. Not that my life is perfect or that I am perfect!!! There are plenty of unproductive days in my life! But when I am following this system, I can literally have 150 things on my to do lists and still feel in control of things and be relaxed and calm. Part of the reason why I'm sure I'll top 150 books this year on top of being a wife, mom, homeschooling 2 children, being a gymnastics meet director, volunteering at our church, traveling a lot (we took a total of 9 trips last year), keeping up with all the housework, organizing lots of activities and trips for other homeschooling families and keeping up with the other dozens of life details, is because Getting Things Done.

I generally like the rule, but have found it problematic when something else also comes to mind, and I forget what that was within two minutes =) By the time I came to read this, I had already learned many productivity strategies from other books and programs. Perhaps I might have walked away with much more if this were one of the first/only books I've read."

You'll probably discover that simply having the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all sorts of creative ideas. You might also be surprised to find that some of the things you write on the list will actually come to pass, almost without your having to make any conscious effort to make them happen.""""We're likely to seize opportunities when they arise if we've already identified and captured them as a probability.""""Your system cannot be static."" ""What most people don't realize is that my lists are, in one sense, my office.""""What is the weekly review? Very simply, the weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again. The weekly review is so critical that it behooves you to establish good habits, environments, and tools to support it. Once your comfort zone has been established for the kind of related control that Getting Things Done is all about, you won't have to worry too much about making yourself do your review - you'll have to get back to your personal standards again.""""Where did the not-so-good feelings come from?

One day he just started picking up each individual piece of paper on an executive's desk and forcing him to decide what the very next thing he had to do was to move it forward. The results were so immediate and so profound for the executive that Dean continued for years to perfect the methodology using that same question to process the in-basket.""""What's ironic is that it would likely require only about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list.""""We are all already powerful.

274,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "

There are a few individual good ideas, but I would rather have heard about them second hand or e.g. just observed a colleague who maintains an empty inbox. Several times I felt the author, imagining his book a hammer, mistook inappropriate things for nails, as when in one of the later chapters he suggests that you occasionally ask your family ""what are the next steps here?"" at the dinner table.The writing is repetitive, as yours might become if you use a system of scraps of papers and little notes and so on to maintain stress free productivity for 20 years.

279,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358209-scott-dinsmore,5,"Why You Should Read It: Time is the only real scarce resource. We are all battling for more of it. The only way to have more is to spend it wisely.Review:I just finished Getting Things Done. I know. I’m a little late to the game. It was a quick read and I loved the premise. There were no doubt some clear productivity “ah-ha’s” as I read. I have spent a lot of time learning and developing my own productivity system over the years and I’m excited to implement a few more of Allan’s nuggets. Most of the things he mentions are not totally novel but the package he puts them in catches an eye.Top 6 Ways to Quadruple Productivity and Have a Little More Time to Enjoy Life:1. “What is the next task that will get me toward my desired outcome?” This is the biggest point Allen drives home. Always ask this question upon completion of a meeting or task. This alone will put your productivity through the roof. Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"

I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"
282,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040319-denar,4,"Well well well, David's got a point. Stressing out won't get things done, you gotta organize and approach it systematically.

The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
285,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "

It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"

It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
297,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."
298,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31712855-acordul-fin,2,"I do think that some of his ideas are useful (like how important it is to clarify what your goal/project/commitment is and then write down the first physical actions you need to take to complete it), but, quoting another reviewer, the book is ""profoundly American"". It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "

It revolutionized the way I view time management and allows me to accomplish an incredible amount of things in my life. Not that my life is perfect or that I am perfect!!! There are plenty of unproductive days in my life! But when I am following this system, I can literally have 150 things on my to do lists and still feel in control of things and be relaxed and calm. Part of the reason why I'm sure I'll top 150 books this year on top of being a wife, mom, homeschooling 2 children, being a gymnastics meet director, volunteering at our church, traveling a lot (we took a total of 9 trips last year), keeping up with all the housework, organizing lots of activities and trips for other homeschooling families and keeping up with the other dozens of life details, is because Getting Things Done. Needless to say, I believe this is a must read for everyone. "
