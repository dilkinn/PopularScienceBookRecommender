0,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5844166-petra,4,"Instead of writing a full review, I'd like to take up some issues with the low-star reviews, which seem to have strong patterns to them that should be adressed. As a disclaimer - I am merely a reader of this book, not a psychological scientist, and I do think negative reviews have their place for ANYTHING that is meant for an audience. And they are important because when reading reviews, you want to know whether the product is something *you* would like to have and may share some of your interests with other reviewers. However, bad criticism based on misconceptions or misunderstandings are worth adressing to be fair to those who are considering the product.1) ""There is nothing new in that."" That's actually the worst argument against that book I have come by - yes, psychology has a thing for scientifically and statistically proving things an alert, smart person will already have realized and experienced all on their own. However, that same alert mind that already knew these things in the book were scientifically/statistically true before it even read about them, should also be able to realize that there are a LOT of people around that do not know these things (in the legal system, for example!) - and who should REALLY read that book. This argument is actually the best justification for the book - ""I SAW this was true before I read the book, because I see the mistakes the people around me make because of these misconceptions."" So, obviously, there is yet some need to have such a book. Also - while many people claim they already knew everything in the book, I wonder whether they really were consciously aware of them.2) ...but those who need to know about these daily illusions of perception will probably say ""the book is boring and I couldn't bring myself to read it"", like other reviewers here have said. Fair enough, so popular science lit on the workings of the mind isn't your thing. What does that say about the quality of the book, though? 3) It's popular science lit, moreover, psychology-based where proper objective tests are hard to come by. How do you rate a person's humor? Exactly, you can't - and the authors acknowledge it and clearly mention the problem, yet try as best as they can to find a way to measure the social value ""humor"" by social standards. Complaining about this strategy is like pointing out a tennis player's lack of skill AFTER he said ""Okay, I'll try to hit the tennis ball, but this frying pan just isn't perfect for this sport.""4) The complaint that the authors were wrong because they were contradicted by another author is always to be taken with a lot of skepticism. Welcome to science: We disagree to figure things out all the time, results and conclusions are updated, interpretations differ. I will not claim expertise in the field myself, nor say I can judge who is right and who is wrong, but anyone who read the book should know that even expert opinions are to be taken with skepticism. Why should that not be true (and perfectly normal) for this book and any other book on the topic, may they contradict each other or not - and are these common problems within science really a problem with the quality of the book? I find it difficult to measure how much detailed contradictory opinion should be included in popular science lit and how much would simply be confusing to the reader, or give a false sense of the scale of any disagreement within science. It may be quite justified to differ with the authors' choices on the matter, but the complaints I read in reviews are only concerned with the authors being ""wrong"", not with their lack of inclusion of contradictory opinions.5) The book is repetitive. Yes, the book lives on example after example to drive the point home - and obviously, some fields in these examples are not entertaining to all readers. I found the anecdotes engaging, mostly BECAUSE they were all different from each other and took on a variety of directions. If I am personally not interested in stock markets - and I am not -, that's actually my problem, but I do appreciate authors who can take their thoughts in all possible directions to engage different kinds of readers. Also, the authors themselves give a warning about anecdotal evidence in the beginning, and the difficulty of obtaining objective evidence on some topics. (see also point 3). The book's contents reflect that, indeed. Maybe it would have been better to write this book 30+ years from now when the evidence is in, but I am actually glad to have it now.6) Political direction... I read a review complaining that certain political people receive ""excuses"" in the book, while others don't and that there may be a political bias in the book. I do not see this political coloration. It merely seemed to me like popular examples were used to drive a point home, nothing more. I also don't agree with the assessment who exactly is ""excused"" and who isn't. 7) No scientist is ever an expert in a broad field. That includes the authors of ""The Invisible Gorilla"". But they are often more of an expert than most laypeople are because they do read the scientific literature and discuss it. Expecting a scientist to be that much of an expert that he or she has published scientific literature in all the topics needed to make a good popular science literature book is slightly utopic. The best you can do then is to include a variety of experts, lengthening the author list - but not everyone is interested in writing popular science lit, nor is everyone capable of adapting to a specific style for a specific book.8) Making a movie for scientific purposes that eventually gets famous on youtube and pops up in a couple of news-sources at some point is not making any scientist popular. Claiming ""The Invisible Gorilla"" got published because that was the authors' claim to fame is at best a red herring. Lastly, a brief review of my own: ""The Invisible Gorilla"" is an interesting glimpse at popular and current psychological science that actually has some interesting implications for our daily lives and understanding of each other and ourselves. Sure, the science seems rather ""new"" at some point (whereas 'new' in science can mean a few decades of research) and the topic is not easy to come by from an objective standpoint, but it would be a pity NOT to have heard of these phenomena. The authors could have reduced the examples and anecdotes, but as they are all neatly sorted and headlined, it is actually pretty easy for readers to skip anything they do not care for and still find a lot they actually do care for. In any case, this is certainly worth reading and thinking - and more importantly - talking about. Many people fall prey to ""everyday illusions"", and even if you are aware of them, having some amunitiont to point them out to others could lead to some really interesting conversations and prevent a few daily mistakes in your vicinity."
1,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"This is a very easy to read, funny yet interesting book. It follows in the line of books that tell us how and why of things, but based on scientific data. This one delves into the difference between reality and perception and how taking our own perception for truth (or believing in other`s for that matter) can catapult us so far away from it. The interesting thing is that (and there are many examples of this in the book); our brains are wired that way, which makes it even harder to abide by science than fiction. And even if you abide by science, we see examples of misuse of data and statistics to bend the truth.So the next time I see a commercial that starts with a story, or someone tries to lure me into buying some idea or thing through their own story, or defends a thwarted causality; I am more equipped."
2,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833260-julie,4,"This was a fascinating book on one of my very favourite topics: why our brains don't work the way we think they do. If you haven't already, check out this video. I, for one, was one of the people who completely missed the gorilla the first time I saw it. (If you've seen this video already, check out this one. Trust me.) The invisible gorilla video is an example of the first of six ""everyday illusions"" Chabris and Simons discuss in their book. In the same way that optical illusions trick us into thinking one thing when we're really seeing another, the mental illusions in The Invisible Gorilla trick us into thinking our minds are more capable than they often are. Here are the six illusions:1. The illusion of attention -- We believe that if something unexpected shows up in our field of vision, we'll notice it. In fact, whether we notice it or not is dependent on what we're focusing our attention on at the time. 2. The illusion of memory -- We believe that if we remember something, especially if we remember it vividly, then that memory is a valid reflection of what actually happened. In fact, memories fade and change over time, and just because a memory is vivid doesn't mean it's accurate. (Fun experiment: Do you remember what you were doing on 9/11 when you found out about the plane crashes? Write it down, and have the people you were with write their memories as well. You might be surprised by the subtle and not-so-subtle differences between memories.)3. The illusion of confidence -- We assume that someone's confidence reflects their level of skill and ability. In fact, there's not necessarily a correlation, and the people who are worst at some skill are often the most overconfident. We tend to follow and believe people who are very confident, but that doesn't mean these people make the best decisions.4. The illusion of knowledge -- We think we understand much more about the world around us than we really do. (Fun experiment: do you know how your toilet, zipper, or bicycle works? If you do, ask yourself ""why?"" a couple of times, and you'll see you don't really know as much as you thought. e.g. Why does the zipper grip the teeth? No clue.) Moreover, because we think we know how complex systems work, we often make predictions and plans that are doomed to fail. (Think about the financial crisis.)5. The illusion of cause -- We see patterns where there are none, and see causation when there might only be correlation or chronology. Also, once we believe in those patterns and causes, it's extremely difficult for scientific evidence or statistics to sway us. This illusion is why there's a huge anti-vaccination movement in the U.S. right now.6. The illusion of potential -- We believe that we only use a small portion or a small potential of our brains, and thus we can become much smarter, much faster. This is the reason for the whole ""Mozart effect"" phenomenon (even though no researchers have replicated the original experiment) and Nintendo's Brain Age. While we can become more skilled at tasks with practice, the idea that there's a ""get smart quick"" solution is an illusion.I think this book is fascinating, and I recommend it. If you read it, you'll start seeing these illusions everywhere, which is I think what the authors intended."
3,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,5,"Bullet Review:Fantastic thoughtful book. I think EVERYONE needs to read this, just to remind us that, hey, everybody's got limitations.Jenny McCarthy, if by some odd chance, you are reading this, I have one thing for you: SHUT UP. Shame on you for deceiving parents into not vaccinating their kids because they MAY get autism - which ISN'T TRUE IN THE SLIGHTEST ANYWAY, but really, autism is WORSE THAN A DEAD CHILD??!?! Do us a favor and go away - after loudly proclaiming what a moron you were for perpetuating this stupid anti-vaccine thing."
4,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3513955-doug,4,"This is a mostly fascinating book which discusses the differences between how we imagine that our minds/brains work and how really do. The authors are the psychologists who did the experiment a decade ago using a movie of two teams of people passing basketballs back & forth between them. They asked people to watch the film and count the number of passes between members of the team in white tee-shirts. Then they asked the watchers if they noticed anything unusual about the film. About half the subjects did not notice that a person in a gorilla suit enters the scene a half minute in, turns to the camera, thumps its chest, then continues off screen again. The gorilla is on screen for about 10 seconds, but half the people missed it! The books discusses the illusions of: attention - we think we see more than we do  memory - we don't remember events accurately  confidence - we tend to overly value confidence  knowledge - do we know as much as we think? cause - does sequence or correlation imply causation?  potential - are there easy ways to 'get smart'? The book makes its points very well & is full of interesting examples of the illusions and the experiments that show how we fall prey to them. "
5,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"If you've not yet gotten around to reading any of the other psychology books that I've recommended to you yet, consider this one. It's fun, and light, but still pretty good science. The authors do have agendas and so do, sometimes, oversimplify a bit to make a point, but as best as I can tell their points are valid.Not all are new points. For example they talk about the phenomenon of 'group-think' as if it's something scientists are just figuring out now. Otoh, maybe this time the points will sink in to some readers. For example, a US intelligence agent revealed ""a method that his group sometimes used to arrive at a shared estimate for an unknown quantity. The members went around the room, each giving his or her estimate [aloud], in order of seniority."" Apparently a similarly ridiculous strategy was part of the problem w/ G.W. Bush and the WMDs (which, you surely know, were never found).In addition to learning how our intuitions, illusions, and blind spots can fool us (but how they're usually effective strategies and that's why we are so accustomed to using them) and some methods to try to overcome them to arrive at intelligent, well-reasoned decisions, the authors debunk many pervasive myths of bad science.1. Vaccinations do not cause autism, and letting your kid become a carrier affects those who have no choice but to skip vaccinations, for example kids with leukemia.2. The worst part of using a cell-phone while driving is not the occupation of your hands, but your attention, and 'hands-free' or Bluetooth is *not* a solution. Just because you can manage the primary task of staying on the road while maintaining a conversation with someone you can't see does not mean you'll be ready for the rare, the unexpected... and it only takes one unexpected event to cause a crash that could be deadly. How many crashes does a distracted driver almost get into, but doesn't because the other drivers are alert? He'll never know, because he's distracted and doesn't notice them.3. Malcolm Gladwell is not worth reading. 4. Epidemiological studies are *not* a substitute for experimentation, because neither correlation nor chronology equate to causation... headlines like ""Bullying Harms Kids' Mental Health"" and ""Housework Cuts Breast Cancer Risk"" certainly do not refer to experiments with a single variable, random sampling, and a control group. Also, one can always imagine other explanations for the 'results' of an epidemiological analysis. Next time you want to stock up on the latest 'superfood' or fitness equipment, consider alternative explanations that could explain the results of the research.5. Confidence often occurs in a reverse r'ship to competence. As the adage goes, 'the more I learn, the more I realize how ignorant I am.' Confidence appeals to patients who want god-like doctors, to readers of business journals who want to emulate the brash leaders who currently at the top of their game, to competitors who have been coached to have a 'winning attitude,' but I would rather have a doctor admit that she wanted to look something up before offering a diagnosis, and I'd rather learn to be a leader or a winner from somebody who's willing to think through strategies, take reasonable risks, listen to input, and acknowledge that random chance ('luck') is very often a factor in success.6. Journalists and others don't need to lie to convince us of cause & effect. If they can reveal sequence in story form, we ""tend to remember a narrative better when we have to draw such inferences"" ourselves. We ""form a richer and more elaborate memory.""7. Brain training games improve our ability to play brain training games. The skills almost never transfer sufficiently widely to be a good use of time. The best exercise for our brains is physical exercise, even a several brisk walks a week help more.etc.Yes, the humor example, cited in several other reviews, sucks. But there are plenty of other reasonable studies and experiments.Frustrating that the notes are so extensive. End notes for bibliographic info. is fine. But. If there's more information than you can manage to incorporate into the text, please put the notes at the end of each chapter or use footnotes. The constant flipping was driving me nuts.I do want to investigate a book mentioned: Super Crunchers: Why Thinking-by-Numbers Is the New Way to Be Smart. And I want to check out the video-game Rise of Nations, listed (but not touted, but still...) as a slow-paced strategy game, possibly good for seniors.But gosh, I've read so much psychology lately, I think it's about time I take a break and let the science make some more breakthroughs and for books to be written about them. Shouldn't take too long at the rate they're going."
6,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"I finished this book much more aware of how limited my mental abilities are. And that's a good thing. As Chabris and Simons state in the conclusion, these mental illusions ""result from mistaken judgments about our limitations."" If we are willing to acknowledge and accept those limitations we are that much more aware of the illusions and better able to see through them.Chabris and Simons discuss several commonplace, everyday illusions which the vast majority of us are not only unaware of, but actively believe don't exist. The illusion of attention explains why driving while talking on a cell phone is dangerous and why hands-free sets aren't any safer than hand-held phones - and why so many people talk on their cell phones anyway. The illusion of memory is one I've run across in my own life several times - our memories change over time and even those details of which we are completely sure can be shown to be wrong when compared to others' memories or a video of the event, so how reliable are they, really? The illusion of confidence has interesting implications for group dynamics and frightening consequences for those accused of crimes by eyewitnesses absolutely sure of what they saw - and absolutely wrong. The illusion of knowledge was particularly striking to me. We don't know what we don't know because ""we rarely bother to probe the limits of our knowledge."" We assume because we use a toilet everyday that we know how and why one works, but our ability to explain the ""whys"" breaks down much more quickly than we think it will.The last two illusions were the weakest chapters for me. After the first four chapters full of interesting revelations about the way the mind works, the illusion of cause was almost disappointing just because it wasn't new. Every high school science class covers the fact that correlation does not mean causation, though there are many people who still have trouble grasping that concept even if they pay lip service to it. Chabris and Simons use the obvious example of the MMR vaccine and autism, complete with references to Jenny McCarthy and Andrew Wakefield, to demonstrate this illusion.The last illusion addressed in the book is the illusion of potential. In my mind, this boiled down to people want simple, guaranteed formulas for weight loss, fading memory, and smart children and so they believe that this pill or mental exercise or Disney DVD will do it for them. Didn't seem all that surprising or earth-shattering to me.They close the book with only a few suggestions for combating these illusions in the reader's life. First, after a few swipes at Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, ""be wary of your intuitions."" And second, ""You can make better decisions...if you do your best to look for the invisible gorillas in the world around you."" In other words, after reading this book you'll be more cognizant that you may not have seen all there is to see, you may not remember exactly what really happened, and you may not know as much as you think you do, especially if you're too confident. Hopefully with that knowledge you can ""proactively restructure"" your environment (i.e., don't talk on a cell phone while driving and don't assume someone is lying if they misremember what exactly happened at a given event) to take these illusions into account.The book provides fascinating insights into how the mind works versus how we think it works, and that awareness is valuable in itself. But I would have appreciated a few more suggestions on counteracting these illusions besides ""be more aware,"" ""use technology,"" and ""trust science."" If goodreads did half stars, this would be a 3.5.For more book reviews, come visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
7,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43915571-julie,5,"i think this is a must read. i had started questioning the way things are even before finding this book but when i did and when i started reading it showed me in how many ways human knowledge is limited, so i think this is one of the books that literally made me a better person.it's a must read for everyone."
8,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,4,"Because I was already familiar with the hidden gorilla experiment demonstrating inattentional blindness, I initially assumed this book would be a rehash. But it delivered a more detailed study of the illusion of attention and six other illusions, and turned out to be an informative source of information on hidden human behavioral patterns. This are:(1) Illusion of Attention—although we think we see what’s in front of us, focus and expectation leads us to often miss the unexpected, even when it is salient, potentially important, and appears right where they are looking.(2) Illusion of Memory—we mistakenly believe that our memories are accurate and precise.(3) Illusion of Confidence—causes us to overestimate our own competency and erroneously interpret it as a valid signal of other people’s competence.(4) Illusion of Knowledge—people tend to think they know more than they do.(5) Illusion of Cause—people often see patterns where they don’t exist, wrongly assume correlation implies causation, and wrongly assume earlier events cause later ones.(6) Illusion of Potential—belief that we have a vast untapped brain reservoir (10% myth) that can be easily accessed with simple techniques (e.g., Mozart effect, subliminal messaging, etc.) (7) Illusion of Intuition—the popular and seductive belief that intuitive methods of thinking and making decisions are superior to analytical methods."
9,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2008190-drowningmermaid,3,"There are some pretty major flaws in the experiments he lists as ""proof"" of his points.-Deciding whether a person has a ""good"" or ""bad"" sense of humor-- based on whether their ratings of jokes correlates with 30 professional comedians? Seriously? Isn't it obvious that the people who score ""poorly"" are just the kind of people who don't go to comedy clubs, or find the dumb jokes on TV funny?-There ARE a variety of ways a chess player can be underscored in the ratings. (Although, it is true that 100 points worth of overconfidence is a wide disparity.)Overall, though, it's a fun refutation of Malcolm Gladwell, and a good overview of logical thought."
10,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409670-gofita,5,"The authors conducted a experiment a while to see how many people would see something right in from of them while focused on another task. People were asked to watch a video. They were instructed to count the number of passes of a basketball between a few people. After the video they asked them how many passes they counted and if they had seen anything strange while watching the video. About half said they had not. But a person in a gorilla's costume passed through the screen and pounded its chest and then left the screen on the other side. How could so many people miss something that was right in front of them?Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, both psychologists, set out to understand the illusions that we are constantly susceptible to and how we can become more aware and thus less susceptible to these illusions in our daily lives.1. The illusion of attention. ""When people devote their attention to a particular area or aspect of their visual world, they tend not to notice the unexpected objects, even when those objects are salient, potentially important, and appear right where they are looking."" p.6-72. The illusion of memory. Are memories are not like DVDs that we can playback at will. Our memories distort over time and change. ""Beware of memories accompanied by storong emotions and vivid details--they are just as likely to be wrong as mundane memories, but you're less likely to realize it."" p.793. The illusion of confidence. We tend to overestimate our own qualities, especially our abilities relative to others. This also causes us to interpret the confidence--or lack thereof--that other people express as a valid signal of their knowledge, and of the accuracy of their own memories.""Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge."" p.86 quoted from Charles Darwin.""...people embrace certainty and reject tentativeness, whether in their own beliefs and memories, the counsel of an adviser, the testimony of a witness, or the speech of a leader during a crisis."" p.94Confidence appears to be a personality trait, has little to do with one's underlying knowledge or mental ability. 4. The illusion of knowledge. We mistake familiarity of an object for genuine knowledge. Draw a bicycle from memory. Do you have every gear, every which way the bike works. Can you show and explain how each piece functions to get the bicycle going? How about a toilet? Play the why game and see where the gaps in knowledge start coming...after one why, two?5. The illusion of cause. Our brains like to see patterns even when they're not there. One of the reasons we're so good at faces. We like to see faces in almost everything. We also tend to believe that earlier events cause later events. And we also like to find evidence that confirms our pre-existing beliefs.When two events tend to happen together ,we infer one must have caused the other. But the only way to definitively test whether an association is causal is to run an experiment. Correlation does NOT imply causation.6. The illusion of potential. This leads us to think that vast reservoirs of untapped mental ability exist in our brains, just waiting to be accessed--if we only knew how. This combines two beliefs: first, that underneath it all the brain harbors higher potential to perform better in various situations, etc and second, that we can release this potential with simple techniques that can be easily implemented. There is no Mozart effect. It will not make your baby smarter.""...there is no known way to measure a person's 'brain capacity' or to determine how much of that capacity he or she uses...when brain tissue produces no activity whatsoever for an extended time, that means it is dead."" p.199""The brain's potential is vast, and you can indeed tap into it, but it takes time and effort."" p.212. Looks like learning and deep knowledge are all possible but it still takes practice, practice, practice, and more practice.And walking a few hours a week is also a great way to keep your brain in shape, especially for cognitive tasks like multitasking and planning.Everyday illusions...all make us think that our mental abilities and capacities are greater than they actually are...we confuse how easily our minds can do something with how well they are doing it. p.230Intuition tells us that we pay attention to more than we do, that our memories are more detailed and robust than they are, that confident people are competent people, that we know more than we really do, that coincidences and correlations demonstrate causation, and that our brains have vast reserves of power that are easy to unlock...[they] are wrong..."" p.230-231""Be wary of your intuitions, especially intuitions about how your own mind works...in many cases, intuition is poorly adapted to solving problems in the modern world."" p.241""Take any opportunity you find to pause and observe human behavior through the lenses we've given you. Try to track your own thoughts and actions as well, to make sure your own intuitions and gut-level decisions are justified. Try your best to slow down, relax, and examine your assumptions before you jump to conclusions.When you think about the world with an awareness of everyday illusions, you won't be as sure of yourself as you used to be, but you will have new insights into how your mind works, and new ways of understand why people act the way they do. Often, it's not because of stupidity, arrogance, ignorance, or lack of focus. it's because of the everyday illusions that affect us all. Our final hope is that you will always consider this possibility before you jump to a harsher conclusion."" p.242Mind-altering book for sure. I will be looking at this one again and again!"
11,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"A highly interesting book! The title refers to the well-known online video in which viewers are urged to count the number of passes made by one basketball team. At one point in the video, a person in a gorilla costume walks through the scene, but many viewers are so busy tracking passes that they don't notice. This book is about some of the hidden biases in the way our brains cope with the world. At least some of these will probably shock many readers. While it's probably impossible to eliminate these perceptual quirks altogether, simply being aware of their existence may help people gain a truer picture of the world. A fascinating book, well worth reading."
12,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction and it falls into the psychology genre. I found this one interesting. He used the study where many observers of one group could NOT see the chest thumping gorilla right in front of them. The brain is so remarkable in doing the task that is at hand that it can sometimes filter out the obvious. I listened to the audio and not once did this feel like a high school science class. So woohoo for that. I liked this. It gave me something to think about, so 4 stars. "
13,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356675-stephen,2,"So...this book got published because it's by a pair of celebrity scientists (not to say that that affects their other work, but I think it effected the book).The problem that I see with it, generally, is that they have a very interesting set of experiments about what they call attentional blindness and the illusion of attention. I.e. the reason that a bunch of people didn't notice a gorilla (well, someone in a gorilla suit) walk through a crowd of students passing around basketballs, and why people are really surprised that they would miss the gorilla just because they're paying attention to something else in the video.Now, generally, I won't complain about that, clearly the authors know a thing or to. But their book is about 5 other illusions as well (five other chapters) to deal with. And though the authors have vague fingers in those other illusions, they aren't experts. This was driven home to me on a few occasions where I could spot some significant (and not so significant but chapter beginning) problems.The second chapter is about the illusion of memory - basically the idea that our memories aren't as trustworthy as we think they are. Which is fair enough and true (and something I was already aware of--I might be less critical if I didn't know about it). But they make mistakes about so called flashbulb memory, our more vivid memory, and more accurate memory, of shocking situations--the reason we can all say where we were and what were we doing on 9/11. Chabris and Simons actually claim that flashbulb memory is just as faulty as any other memory. While I am not an expert, I did read an expert on the subject right before this book. James L. McGaugh, who wrote Memory and Emotion, while not the expert on flashbulb memory is the expert on why flashbulb memory comes into play--basically that heightened stress works a lot like repetition in solidifying long term memories.Now, I'll say this for Chabris and Simons; their job is to tell people that the accuracy of our memories is an illusion, so their focus is on reminded us of that. But that doesn't mean they need to exaggerate that innaccuracy, to confuse the inaccuracy of normal memory with well ingrained memory. While McGaugh doesn't deny that flashbulb memories are imperfect, but he does have numbers for how accurate those memories are and can tell us when the memories will be more or less accurate.So yeah, that bugged me.Shortly after a section on how technobabble and scientific-ese can be used to say nothing but sound good, they opened the next chapter with a nothing explanation of why 'Measles is among the most infectious virus affecting children,' implying that this is because 'When a person with measles sneezes, another person can contract the disease just by breathing the air in the room or touching a contaminated surface.' The problem is that that's pretty much true of a lot of viruses. Influenza, cold viruses for a start.And I do have a bit of a problem with their own subject, the inattentional blindness. They argue that driving while talking on a hands free cellphone is just as dangerous as talking on a handheld cellphone. And while it might be more dangerous than we realize, the authors are awfully quick to dismiss one handed driving as having NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER on our ability to steer sharply and quickly, say, if we need to maneuver to avoid an accident. ""We can drive just find with one hand on the wheel"" Which is true, under normal circumstances when we just need course corrections. But sharper more sudden turns need more control. And while they conducted an experiment to show that handsfree cellphone conversations can distract us and cause us to miss unexpected objects, their rather blithe in assuming that our ability to detect a red cross on a computer screen that subjects thought only had black and white letters is comparable to our ability to detect objects that are effectively speeding at us in a danger situation.(Maybe I was just ornery about their earlier idiocy, and tending to be somewhat unfair, but it's a problem. Considering that they talk about experiments using driving simulations, couldn't they do that here?)The book had its good points, but I'm just too annoyed to mention them.Edited:I also forgot that the inconsistency on confidence - at one point they say that our confidence varies (not directly) with our skill and a few pages later they quote studies that our confidence is more or less constant.Second, I forgot (and this is my favorite) that they use studies which say that there are universal measures of comedy. There is a right and wrong judgment on which jokes are funnier than ever. Hilarious joke. Oh, wait, they're serious? They don't realize that people have different tastes in humor? What's that, you can disagree on what dramas are better than others, but comedy is only rated on an absolute scale that you must adhere to?"
14,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1715224-jessi,4,"This book looks at the things we think we know, but really don't. There are Illusions of Attention, Memory, Confidence, Knowledge, and Potential. Each of the illusions is examined, with examples shown of the differences between what we think happens and what really happens. Attention-Everyone believes that we see everything that happens in the world around us. This is where the famous Invisible Gorilla video comes into play. Check it out. This is just one example of selective attention. We only pay attention to the things we're told to look at. Another example given is when radiologists missed a problematic guidewire after a surgery even though it was prominent in all of their X-Rays. They were only looking for heart problems. We also have inattentional blindness (this is inevitable when we focus on a difficult problem) which can lead us to missing things we don't expect to see. Proof of this is the fact that automobile accidents involving pedestrians and bicycles rise in areas where pedestrians and bicyclists aren't often found. Drivers don't expect to see them, so they don't actively look for them.Memory-Overwhelmingly, people believe that our memories work like DVDs. We can just watch something over and over in our minds without anything ever changing. We also believe that eyewitnesses are some of the best evidence for convicting people. However, it has been proven time and time again that even the best eyewitnesses can be mistaken. Even experiments tracking people’s memories of traumatic events (the Challenger exploding, 9/11) show that the further you get from the event, the less likely you are to remember specific details. The authors even throw in their own memories as proof.Confidence-The most confident people are the ones who know their subjects best, right? Wrong. We have been taught to trust the people who seem the most confident but there is rarely a correlation to those who are the most competent. This is why con men are so darn good at getting away with things. They just appear to be confident in their knowledge and no one asks any questions.Knowledge-Do we really know how the world works? Or we just think we do. The first example given by Chabris and Simons is to think about how a bicycle works. Almost everybody knows that. But try to explain to a five-year-old why moving pedals gets you from here to there and it gets harder to say that you really know what is going on when you hop on a bike. One subset of the Illusion of Knowledge is the Illusion of Cause. We often assume that because two things occur together, there must be a direct cause and effect when often there is a third (or even more) item that may be causing both. The most well-known of these studies is the supposed rate between autism and the MMR vaccine. Potential-Another illusion is that of potential wherein we believe that the human brain has untapped potential if we only use the right key to unlock it. This belief has lead to the rise of “brain exercise” games. However, it’s interesting to note that recent research has proven that physical exercise may actually play more of a role in how well our brain is faring.Parts of this book directly address (and refute) Malcolm Gladwell’s book 
Blink
 wherein the author pushes us to accept our intuition and “go with our guts.” These authors would argue that we should know when we should trust our intuition and when more analyzing would be more beneficial.Readalikes: Even though the authors dismiss parts of his work, I still think that Malcolm Gladwell’s books are worth reading."
15,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,1,"The authors once conducted an experiment where people were asked to count basketballs while another person walked through their field of vision, unnoticed, dressed as a gorilla. The authors concluded that there was an illusion of attention (""inattentional blindness""). They expanded this notion to write this book about the illusions of memory, confidence, knowledge, causal relationships, and potential. Their lesson from all of this is that we need to be wary of our intuitions as they are poorly adapted to the modern world. ""Think twice,"" they advise, ""before you decide to trust intuition over rational analysis....""It's not clear what's new here. Learning to drive a car, we're advised to look twice before turning into traffic to catch what we missed the first time. We're told to pay attention to the car in front because looking is not the same thing as seeing. Concentration on a task will exclude extraneous data. That's the point (and beauty) of concentration. Ask people not to count basketballs and you might get a very different result. As for the other illusions, the problems of selective and false memory have been known for years. Wise people have cautioned forever against false confidence, and about holes in our knowledge and causal logic.As for the remedy, the authors advise the readers to trust rational analysis over intuition. Intuition may have worked in our primal days, they say, but is no longer adequate in these modern days. That advice certainly pertains to, say, pilots being trained to trust their instruments over intuition. But in people relationships, which still largely populate what we do and how we do them, we might be better off by relying less on rational analysis and paying more attention to what our non-rational intuitions are picking up. The arched eyebrow can convey a truer meaning than a rational sentence. "

It's true enough (as this book notes) that correlation does not equal causation, but sometimes correlation can point the way to a workable hypothesis. So here are a few things I noticed about this book. People and things who received positive spin in The Invisible Gorilla: George W. Bush, Chief Justice John Roberts, Jim Cramer, the Iraq War. People who were the subjects of disapproving or snide remarks: certain members of Barack Obama's cabinet, Chris Matthews, Hillary Clinton, Malcolm Gladwell. Enough to prove a bias? Maybe, maybe not. But certainly enough to convince me I'll not be seeking out further writings from these authors. This review is a slightly reworked version of my original review, which was accidentally deleted."

18,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ,3,"Interesting book about about six illusions that influence our lives: the illusions of attention, memory, confidence, knowledge, cause, and potential. These illusions sway our perceptions and decisions everyday, slipping under the radar of our awareness. Some of the fallacies and debunked widespread myths exposed by this book: • believing the testimony of a confident eye witness (even highly vivid memories can be unreliable) • driving while using a hands free phone is fine (not true, highly dangerous) • confident people are competent people, e.g. prefer a confident doctor (false, see quote) • people can feel others staring at them behind their backs (not true) • our brains have vast resources of untapped power, e.g. most people use only 10% of their brain (untested and also not provable) • mind control via persuasive subliminal messages, e.g. in advertising (false) • the Mozart effect, i.e. listening to Mozart’s music improves brain capabilities (false) • cognitive games (e.g. Brain Age) can help in memory and other brain functions (false, training tends to be specific to the task that is trained for and is not transferable to other cognitive tasks).It’s not all negative news, though, here a surprising truth: • Seniors who had walked for just forty-five minutes a day for three days each week preserved much more gray matter in their frontal brain regions than did those who had done stretching and toning. Aerobic exercise actually did keep their brains healthier and younger. It might seem counterintuitive, but the best thing you can do to preserve and maintain your mental abilities may have little to do with cognition at all. Overall I enjoyed this, the author’s arguments are clearly expressed and persuading, the book is, however, rather dry.Fav. Quotes:We will almost never be aware of the more subtle evidence of our distraction. Drivers who make mistakes usually don’t notice them; after all, they’re distracted. The problem is that we lack positive evidence for our lack of attention. That is the basis of the illusion of attention. We are aware only of the unexpected objects we do notice, not the ones we have missed. Consequently, all the evidence we have is for good perception of our world. It takes an experience like missing the chest-thumping gorilla, which is hard to explain away (and which we have little incentive to explain away), to show us how much of the world around us we must be missing.Unfortunately, people often confuse what is easily noticed when it is expected with what should be noticed when it is unexpected.If we are right that inattentional blindness results from inherent limits on the capacity of visual attention, it might be impossible to reduce or eliminate it in general. In essence, trying to eliminate inattentional blindness would be equivalent to asking people to try flying by flapping their arms really rapidly. The structure of the human body doesn’t permit us to fly, just as the structure of the mind doesn’t permit us to consciously perceive everything around us.The best doctors show a range of confidence—they admit when they don’t know and are more confident when they do know. Doctors who willingly consult people with greater knowledge than their own are likely to provide much better care than those who think they can handle any situation on their own.Everyday illusions tell us that we perceive and remember more than we do, that we’re all above average, and that we know more about the world and the future than is justified. Everyday illusions might be so persistent and pervasive in our thought patterns precisely because they lead us to think better of ourselves than we objectively should. Positive illusions can motivate us to get out of bed and optimistically take up challenges we might shrink from if we constantly had the truth about our minds in mind.Neuroscience research is showing that the plasticity of the adult brain—its ability to change in structure in response to training, injury, and other events—is much greater than previously believed. The illusion is that it is easy to unlock this potential, that it can be discovered all at once, or that it can be released with minimal effort."
19,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,5,"To their credit, Chabris and Simons are IG Nobel Prize winners and this book is highly recommended by academics. Since the focus of this book is cognitive psychology and its applications in daily life, I couldn’t help but contrast and compare it with Thinking Fast & Slow. Invisible Gorilla explains the six illusions that plague us, which involve illusions of•	Attention: Our moment-to-moment expectations, more than the visual distinctiveness of the object, determine what we see and what we miss.•	Memory: This further involves o	‘failure of source memory’ i.e. the information retrieved from memory is more like an improvised riff on a familiar melody rather than a digital recording of an original performanceo	‘flashbulb memory’ i.e. an emotionally significant event vividly recalled which makes us confuse the fluency of the memory with its accuracy•	Confidence: Perceiving higher confidence as a benchmark for greater ability•	Knowledge: Our inflated belief in what we know•	Cause: confusing two similar trends as one causing the other, whether the events occur simultaneously or sequentially.•	Intuition: Highly trusting instincts over rational analysisHowever, Kahneman & Tversky highlighted the heuristics or rules of thumb by which we process information. They include:•	Anchoring: Being swayed by irrelevant information presented prior to making a decision. •	Availability: Our tendency of making judgments on the frequency of an event basis ease of recall.•	Representative: making judgments basis a comparison with something else in mind or treating a small sample as a representative of the entire group.•	Regression to the mean: Within the context of psychology, regression to the mean describes our tendency to make biased predictions about the future, i.e. believing in a constant upward or downward trend rather than realising that performance eventually returns to the mean. •	Hindsight bias: our tendency to look back at past events, adjust our worldview to accommodate the surprise and hold the position that “I-knew-it-all-along.” The illusion of memory can be linked to the availability heuristic and the hindsight bias. We retrieve a self-doctored memory, which makes us believe in a certain frequency of an event basis how easily we can remember it. And this memory can be self-doctored when one looks back at, for example, surprising political elections and technological innovations and reframes one’s wrong predictions to match reality. The myth of intuition is similar to the System 1 – System 2 analogy of Kahneman & Tversky. Our reflexive system 1 is what gives us the ‘gut feeling’, however this feeling may not be reliable in situations where one has no prior experience. ‘Gut’ is to be followed more credibly in areas where, due to hours of practice, one has developed pattern recognition skills. However, the other four illusions – attention, confidence, knowledge, and cause – are different from heuristics. One surprising element is the lack of any mention of Thaler and Sunstein’s ‘nudge’ theory. But, this book is very palatable for anyone interested in cognitive psychology. More importantly, it proves that our imperfections are not only due to our limitations but also our mistaken judgments about them."

Obviously the real world doesn't have these things (probably) so in the fictional universe it's explained that people simply look the other way in the face of overwhelming evidence. Why does that sound familiar?As a trope in fiction this phenomenon is known as the weirdness censor, but it's just fiction, right? Just because something is unexpected doesn't mean we wouldn't see it, right? Enter the invisible gorilla experiment. It's a fun experiment, but unfortunately it's one you can't do if you know about it; even knowing the name of the experiment kind of makes doing it pointless. But still, if you want to try it out then it's the first video at this webpage. The other videos are cute little experiments to try too.Done? Okay. The experiment is easy: a 30 second video is shown of six people walking around in a small area. Three of the people wear white, and three wear black. The people wearing white pass a basketball around amongst themselves, and so do the people in black. The task is simply to count how many times the people in white pass the ball. It's harder than it sounds as everyone is constantly moving and there are two balls flying around, but the answer is about 15 passes. That's not the point. The point was: did you notice the person in the gorilla costume walk across the screen about half way through the video? They stopped in the middle of all the people, started at the camera, and beat their chest. If you did see the gorilla your response to this enquiry is probably “Of course I saw the gorilla, how could anyone not see the gorilla?” If you didn't see the gorilla your response is probably more like “Of course there wasn't a gorilla, I think I'd notice something like that.”Knowing that the experiment involves invisible gorillas means you'd almost certainly notice the gorilla, but amongst those people who go into the experiment unprimed, i.e. not expecting to see a gorilla, about half of them don't see the gorilla. And now I've written “gorilla” too many times and it looks funny. Gorilla gorilla gorilla. Dammit.Anyway. Those dry psychology types refer to this real life weirdness censor as inattentional blindness. If you're focusing on one task you can easily be blind to other salient events going on around you. In itself this isn't a problem; the problem arises because of inattentional blindness blindness. Get a large number of people to do the invisible gorilla experiment and about half of them will fail to see the gorilla. But describe the experiment to a large number of people and ask if they would have seen the gorilla and almost all of them will say that they would.This book discusses various ways in which people are both blind to something, but also blind to their blindness. Being pop-science it leans pretty heavily on anecdotes, but hammers home the fact that anecdotes do not good science make. It provides references to experiments when these have been carried out, and freely admits when such experiments either haven't or can't be carried out. The tone sometimes comes across as kind of self-helpy, which is unfortunate since I'm pretty sure that is absolutely not what the authors are trying to achieve. All in all it's a fun, if occasionally depressing, look at the limitations of how people perceive the world and, more importantly, how they perceive themselves."
21,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308672-jeremy,4,"A good read for a plane ride. It puts together several ""illusions"" that are all related to how our brain works. The authors assemble a mountain of academic research in their field, psychology, and several related ones, and package them into compact, wonderfully written chapters. There are deep insights every couple pages. What is admirable throughout is their rigorous commitment to the scientific method, to questioning their own conclusions, and to limiting and qualifying most of their results. Even so, you find yourself taking away important insights into how your brain, and your society, work. Example--we don't notice changes we aren't looking for. We all THINK we would, but data shows we don't. This has micro and macro applications. At the macro level, I wanted to apply it to politics. People who aren't paying attention won't notice radical changes in a political party they are familiar with. I also enjoyed the illusion that our brains had undeveloped potential that could be easily tapped. The authors show you how baloney those claims are, mostly made by hucksters, assisted by less ethical members of the academic community. The ""listen to Mozart"" and get smarter one is so well debunked, it's fun to read as they take down various frauds and delusions that resulted from the single article (that they also debunk). This is a fine example of popularizing a whole set of academic findings, and while you think every now and then that the ""illusions"" frame that they use becomes forced, it always rebounds and convinces you otherwise. Maybe it's an illusion, but a good one!"

It describes the most common ones:The illusion of vision/attention - that we can and see everything we set our eyes on (which is the one shown by the gorilla video and the one that got them the Ig Nobel award);The illusion of memory - we think that our long-term memories don't change (and they do);Confidence - we tend to value confidence a lot more than it's worth, and tend to be more confident about anything we're not familiar with;Knowledge - we think we know more than we actually are (it's shown very well with a ""game"", pick something like a bicycle and try to draw one explain how does it work exactly, and ask questions about all the details and their details - at some point everyone doesn't know the facts and ideas, but thought he/she knew them);Cause - ""correlation doesn't mean causation"", which is also a favorite topic for Nassim Taleb;Potential - that we think there are easy ways to get smart and tons of untapped potential.There are some weak points in the book, and some very strange experiments which seem easily refutable, but all in all it has more than the required amount of scientific backing for what they're trying to explain. The book should be read by anyone who needs to use his/her head, because it would help immensely in understanding your own limitations.(I found this book in the notes of ""Blindsight"" by Peter Watts, and he keeps a longer list of the ways we're wrong, everyone interested can look in his blog)."

I loved the part about the illusion of memory, I loved the part where they warned about correlation becoming causation, and I loved the part about the gorilla experiment. The authors tried to stay neutral on issues like religion in this book, but lots of what was said in this book reminds me of Caveman Logic. Awesome quote:""Parents and scientists seeking a cause for the increase in autism rates spotted this association [between vaccinations and autism:] and inferred a causal relationship. Parents who saw no symptoms before the vaccinations noticed them afterward, a chronological pattern consistent with a causal narrative. They also noticed that increases in vaccination rates roughly coincided with increases in the diagnosis of autism. All three of the major contributors to the illusion of cause-- pattern, correlation, and chronology-- converged in this case. Of course, the increase in the frequency of autism diagnosis also coincided with an increase in piracy off the coast of Somalia, but nobody argues that autism causes piracy (or that pirates cause autism, for that matter).

Another problem is that the book bogs down with lengthy discussion of specific issues (e.g. the science pertaining to vaccinations, the effect of video games on cognitive ability, specific memories of 9/11 etc.) While anecdotes can certainly provide color to, and relief from, abstract analysis, there were too many lengthy stories for my taste; the book didn't impart a commanding scientific flavor (compared to Pinker, Dawkins etc.) Nonetheless, a worthwhile read to help buttress one's knowledge of human limitations.

Thematically similar to ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell, but their conclusions don't often agree.While The Invisible Gorilla has plenty of informative passages, thoroughly evaluating contemporary psychology myths in each part, the book's necessarily negative overtone (subtitled ""And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us"") makes it somewhat dissatisfying as a whole despite valid insights. The book has to be cynical because its unique angle is in its pop-psy contrarianism, explicitly debunking what are picked out as common misconceptions about our minds. Thus, while learning how and why intuitions are misconstrued is enjoyably informative in itself, reading a book fully comprised of false positives about yourself can skew the overall feel toward a sort of reactionary science self-help book. A heavy dose of skepticism might be exactly what you're looking for depending on your own take of modern psychology, but for me it detracted from what is otherwise a scientifically astute book."

I love Gladwell, I love Sheena Iyengar, etc. But I could not finish this book - I had to give up after four tries. The authors present a premise, give an interesting anecdote or research that proves the point, and then proceed to beat the reader over the head with a long-winded narrative to prove the point they already proved. Even worse, the additional narrative usually ends up weakening their argument or even disproving the point/premise! On top of that, the authors have a steep bias for experimental research (which uses a control group) and discount any evidence from quasi-experimental, surveys, and the like, which is a problem because one can rarely do experimental research in the social sciences (i.e. we're going to withhold treatment from alcoholics or food from starving children so we can have a control group).

I listened to this in audiobook form, and I knew it lost me when I started listening to pass the time while doing other tasks, rather than looking FORWARD to listening. Again, I didn't hate it.

Although most of the points in the book are well argued, there are points where the authors jump to conclusions or dismiss proof of countering arguments.

Instead of exploring them, other experiments are explored that showed results in favour of not trusting intuition and then expanded upon without touching on the first set of results again.This is a book that could only benefit someone looking into the downfalls of their own notions of self evaluation in regards to attention, intuition, awareness and preconceptions in these areas. Even though this book is almost a decade old, which makes the scientific value of the research presented diminished a bit, the anecdotes of real events are worth the read alone as an initiation into further reading."
37,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5269102-ron,5,"The Invisible Gorilla by Christopher Chabris and Daniel SimmonsThis book is a great read. It gives six ways that we allow ourselves to be deceived: attention, memory, confidence, knowledge, cause, and potential. The book describes in each of these areas and then lists several case studies that give details on the way we are deceived. It is hard to do this book justice based on all of the case studies that give supporting evidence. A couple of general observations:•	It was amazing how many times a ""study"" was done on something that was faulty, reached a conclusion, published the conclusion, and now is accepted as fact. If further studies were done that refuted the evidence of the first, people still remember the first study.•	It was equally amazing how many studies they had that showed people would agree that somebody else might have a problem (eg, ability to remember details) but ""I"" don't have that problem and am better than the general population (which would then be refuted through a study).The six areas:- Attention: this used the study of a basketball video where you were asked to count the passes by one team and would end up missing a gorilla that ran through the video- Memory: it turns out that we remember things that didn't happen, remember things that did happen incorrectly, change our minds about what we remember over time and can't always tell the difference- Confidence: you can be confident about something and still be wrong - in general, confident people tend to be confident about all aspects of their life- Knowledge: we have been taught that more knowledge is always better, but they give examples where knowing more actually causes you to make worse decisions- Cause: great discussions on how we jump to conclusions - usually associated with us confusing correlation with cause- Potential: we've got all of this untapped potential in our minds that we can train ourselves to use; great examples around video games, listening to Mozart - which are either specific examples (playing video games makes you better at playing video games) or just not tested correctly (only trying Mozart as opposed to any music that relaxes the listener before a standardized test)They conclude with:- There may be important things right in front of you that you aren't noticing due to the illusion of attention. Now that you know about this illusion, you'll be less apt to assume you're seeing everything there is to see.- You may think you remember something much better than you really do, because of the illusion of memory. Now that you understand this illusion, you'll trust your own memory, and that of others, a bit less, and you'll try to corroborate your memory in important situations.- You'll recognize the confidence people express often reflects their personalities rather than their knowledge, memory, or abilities. - You'll be wary of thinking you know more about a topic than you really do, and you will test your own understanding before mistaking familiarity with knowledge. - You won't think you know the cause of something when all you really know is what happened before it or what tended to accompany it.- You'll be skeptical of claims that simple tricks can unleash the untapped potential in your mind, but you'll be aware that you can develop phenomenal levels of expertise if you study and practice the right way."

Think again!As _The Invisible Gorilla_ reveals, we're all deluded by how capable we think our minds are. We've all been under the spell of believing that our brains' abilities and potentials are far greater than they actually are. The reality is that our minds don't work in the ways we think they do. Our ""common sense"" results in us intuitively accepting these six everyday illusions about how our minds work:1. The illusion of attention--believing we experience far more of our visual world than we actually do.Example: Believing we can pay close attention to the road when we are talking on our cell phones and driving.2. The illusion of memory--believing that our memories are more accurate, detailed, and robust than they really are.Example: Assuming that someone who misremembers the past is intentionally lying.3. The illusion of confidence--overestimating our own abilities, and those of others who appear confident.Example: Deciding a doctor is competent based on how confident (s)he appears.4. The illusion of knowledge--believing we understand things at a deeper level than we really do.Example: Thinking we understand how a toilet works when all we really understand is how to work it.5. The illusion of cause--inferring causal relationships from coincidences, and believing earlier events cause later ones.Example: Arthritis sufferers being convinced they have more pain during cold and rainy days.6. The illusion of potential--believing that our brains contain vast amount of untapped abilities that are waiting to be (easily) accessed once we learn how to do so.Example: Buying into ""The Mozart Effect"" which claims that listening to classical music will stimulate learning and improve brain performance. (Hello $100 million/year baby video market!)The authors successfully show how these everyday illusions largely influence our thoughts, decisions, and actions. Their book serves to both warn and inform us:""When you think about the world with an awareness of everyday illusions, you won't be as sure of yourself as you used to be, but you will have new insights into how you mind works, and new ways of understanding why people act the way they do."" (p. 242)So, although the book issues a cautionary (and often shocking!) tale of why we should be skeptical of our intuitions, it also effectively provides the information we need to improve our decisions, actions, and lives--and, of course, to be able to spot the invisible gorillas in our midst."
39,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4094123-victoria-klein,4,"Do you ever feel like your mind is playing tricks on you?You’re not crazy – your instincts are deceiving you (those bastards).My latest rental from the library, The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, provides a jaw-droppingly fascinating perspective into mental illusions that influence our every word, action, and thought.Chabris & Simons, both established cognitive psychologists, are best known for their “Gorillas in Our Midst” study (click the link to try it for yourself!). Their gorilla study (and namesake for the book) is used to illustrate the first of 6 everyday illusions: the illusion of attention. In subsequent chapters, the other 5 illusions are explained in detail: memory, confidence, knowledge, cause, & potential.What we intuitively accept and believe is derived from what we collectively assume and understand, and intuition influences our decisions automatically and without reflection. Intuition tells us that we pay attention to more than we do, that our memories are more detailed and robust than they are, that confident people are competent people, that we know more that we really do, that coincidences and correlations demonstrate causation, and that our brains have vast reserves of power that are easy to unlock. But in all these cases, our intuitions are wrong, and they can cost us our fortunes, our health, and even our lives if we follow them blindly. — Page 231Admittedly, the book may sound like a bit of a downer, but I found it to be extremely intriguing. Included with the extensive explanation of each illusion, Chabris & Simons provide straightforward info on how to break these illusions for yourself. As you might expect, the key is to stop & think before you speak or act, ensuring you are acting from a perspective from of misconceptions.When you think about the world with an awareness of everyday illusions, you won’t be as sure of yourself as you used to be, but you will have new insights into how your mind works, and new ways of understanding why people act the way they do. Often, it’s not because of stupidity, arrogance, ignorance, or lack of focus. It’s because of the everyday illusions that affect us all. — Page 242If you have a curiosity for psychology & the instinctual functions of the human mind, I’m quite sure you will enjoy The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us as much as I did."
40,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6829322-clark-hays,3,"Don’t trust anyone, especially yourself!This book is a quick read about a topic that should interest us all: how notoriously inept we humans are at using the one thing that sets us apart from other animals — our brains. Written by the creators of a classic experiment in which subjects focused on a task (counting basketball passes) fail to see a person in a gorilla suit walk on screen (hence the name), it examines our mental shortcomings in glorious, disheartening detail. As it turns out, we’re terrible observers of events, awful at remembering things accurately, ridiculously influenced by confidence (sadly, regardless of whether that confidence is linked to any kind of expertise at all), prone to dramatically overestimate our own abilities (often with tragic, occasionally comedic, consequences), and willing to form faulty and in some cases implausible (dissonant) logic chains that shackle us to misguided, misinformed and self-defeating beliefs and actions. The authors use familiar stories pulled from the media and a few personal anecdotes — along with a pleasant, avuncular writing style — to start off each chapter and frame the issue, and then use the results of various experiments to unwrap the sources and causes of our self-inflicted delusions. It was fascinating read, but stayed mostly on the surface — as if an in-depth article was expanded to book length — and I found myself wanting more. At least that’s how I remember it, and that’s probably wrong. Still, I recommend it enthusiastically and, since I am clearly an expert book reviewer, my confidence alone should sway you to try it. On an unrelated note, one of my favorite lines was a quote attributed to Darwin: “ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.”For anyone who has studied human nature even in passing, the thought that we are narcissistic simpletons stumbling cluelessly through life should come as no huge surprise. The Invisible Gorilla helps make sense of the shortcomings and offers a few strategies for avoiding the most common mistakes — most notably, don’t trust anyone, especially yourself, until you get past the surface and verify a few facts."

We think we are fully aware of our surroundings, but in fact one of the things that we aren't aware of is precisely the extent to which we are not aware of our surroundings. We think we can remember specific events in full detail, but other people who were there may have completely different memories in perfectly good faith. We trust people who display confidence in themselves and their own judgement, yet in fact they are no more likely to be right or trustworthy than people with lower apparent confidence. We don't know as much as we think we do, and often we don't realise how little we know (the Dunning-Kruger effect). We mistake correlation for causation. And we believe that there may be mental tricks to unlocking our brain's full potential, when in fact the only thing that really has been shown to work for everyone is just keeping fit.Chabris and Simons wittily and forcefully pull apart each of these illusions, fully backed by research and worked examples that you can try on yourself (and on willing friends and relatives). The conclusion is that we must be eternally vigilant, especially about ourselves.I've had some bad luck with popular psychology books recently - in particular a couple of stinkers by Pinker - but this is much better. Recommended."
42,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22355651-rubia,4,"This novel is an adept corroboration of insights and studies attributing to the notion that our minds eye isn’t necessarily all knowing, and perhaps misses the whole picture by lack of peripheral vision, so to speak. In other words, it is insinuated that the illusion of attention distracts us from cues from the vision world. The ice cream bowl/drowning study referenced demonstrates how bias contributed to the illusion of cause. Real world inferences are projected as well, such as the concept of people using their own understanding of a person to fit the event into a pattern, inferring an undeflating cause- case and point the Hilary Clinton faux pas with the Bosnian snipers. Chabris and Simons spend an exorbitant portion of the novel depicting the concept of how the masses are overconfident in their knowledge. They state how confidence has little to do with underlying knowledge or general abilities, and how people tend to believe they are more knowledgeable on a certain topic or ideal because of their innate self assurance. We learn that in a whole, people tend to have an overly positive self evaluation, rather than allocating time and resources to truly have an understanding- which subsidizes to the theory of illusion. The novel concludes with the sentiment that gut responses outperform analytical ones, which was reminiscent of Malcolm Gladwell’s novel Blink. Inasmuch as I personally am a fan, I can attest that much of the content and tone by way of theory and case study in this novel is an homage to Gladwell."

Tail-end because I was ditching another lecture to join in on this one late. I arrived after the video had been played the first time and right when the speaker was telling the audience about the guerrilla in the video that (statistically) half of them missed. The gasp from the audience was huge, then the video was replayed, and when the guerrilla walked by, plain as day, the gasp was even huger. I always wish I knew if I'd have been one of the people to see her. But a book centered around this experiment intrigued me.Unfortunately, I found it sort of scattershot and all over the place. The authors seemed to be trying to pull together a bunch of disperate observations that didn't have all that much to do with each other just by assigning similarly phrased chapter titles.The interesting thing about this book was that it cited a lot of the same studies as How We Decide, but drew different conclusions (both viable conclusions, but I still found it interesting).It was an interesting read— reading about experiment always is— but I'm not quite sure how much I walked away with, other than a reenforced knowledge that we don't always see or remember what is actually there."
44,0307459659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50780835-yuekun-liu,4,"The book talks about our everyday illusions and how these intuitions deceive our understanding. It tells us the “stupid” beliefs that are harmful to our lives. And it reminds us to realize our limits on our ability and to look at the real scientific evidence before we want to believe something. Why we cannot see things that are unexpected? —the illusion of attention. Could our memory be trusted? Or Does our emotion sometimes deceive us the accuracy? —the illusion of memory. Should we take somebody’s confidence as the knowledge/information or just take it as a personality?—the illusion of confidence. (my favourite chapter)Could familiarity deceive us that we think we understand the matter? Test yourself by keeping asking yourself “whys”.—the illusion of knowledge. Why some well educated parents refuse the vaccination for their children? what happened?—the illusion of cause.For real? I could improve my IQ by listening to Mozart. I could actually change the world because I only use 10% of my brain now.

It also offers a lot of acknowledgments to people and footnotes. This is all well and good, but the fact that it offers insight into how you can curb these illusions is the most gratifying conclusion you can expect.While we can’t completely eliminate these illusions around us, we can “override” them by knowing that they are there — if only for brief moments. Chabris and Simons point out that if you take on these everyday distortions head-on, you’ll be able to have a better understanding of why people do what they do. This is an asset when dealing with people that you plan on being eventual with. You’ll be able to not only gauge their receptiveness, but how much you’re going to pay for it in the end. Unless you choose not to see it coming.They also point out that you’ll be less sure of yourself once the veil of the “illusion of attention” is lifted. But I’m still pretty sure of myself even after taking in The Invisible Gorilla, a thought-provoking and well-written book."

They are the illusions of attention, memory, confidence, knowledge, cause, and potential. For each illusion, the authors provide a number of interesting stories that are supported by extensive studies and research. The name of the book comes from one of the most famous psychological experiments ever. This experiment, conducted by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, involved asking participants to watch a video in which two teams, one in black shirts and one in white shirts, are passing a ball. The participants are told to count how many times the players in white shirts pass the ball.Mid-way through the video, a gorilla walks through the game, stands in the middle, pounds his chest, then exits. Then, study participants are asked, ""But did you see the gorilla?"" More than half the time, subjects miss the gorilla entirely. More than that, even after the participants are told about the gorilla, they're certain they couldn't have missed it."

According to Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, I miss a heckuva lot that's going on right in front of my nose, and come to conclusions based on my own state of mind rather than the facts. The book sets out to debunk 6 or so everyday illusions - attention, knowledge, memory,confidence, cause, and potential. In the process it takes down a lot of commonly held beliefs (eg. doing crossword puzzles increases your brain power for other areas of life, or the more vivid your memory of an important event in you life is, the more accurate it must be). Other than a few parts that nearly bored me out of my skull (the stock market stuff and video games), I found this book very interesting and enlightening. In short, I got spanked. I now see that I don't see as much as I think I see, know as much as I think I know, remember as well as...well, you get the picture. Maybe you shouldn't read this book, maybe you prefer your illusions."

And as with most books in this vein, they mix newspaper headlines and anecdotes with scientific psychological research. What I probably appreciated most about the book was how the authors used the lessons to debunk various commonly held but erroneous beliefs: the Mozart effect (playing classical music makes babies smarter), Jim Collins's ""Good to Great"" claptrap about business success, Malcom Gladwell's approach to ""thin slicing"" the decision making process in his book Blink, how weather affects arthritis, and more.

The research and information is quite shocking and more than interesting, and i particularly liked how it even stated out some problems I had for a while seen with a number of the popular business books, especially in these days when it's so fashionable to praise an intuitive leader over a rational one. Warmly recommending it to anybody who wants to improve their thinking/seeing/hearing process of the world. It may raise a number of quite conflicting issues, but in realizing our limitations we can actually build workarounds, as opposed to just ignoring them so i definitely think it's worth knowing more about the things you don't know... and don't know that you don't know because you don't know them."

Right at the onset of an event, it’s remarkable how some artifacts one would assume to be obvious may be completely oblivious & never recorded. How we fill in the blanks (such as assuming a bookshelf was full of books), or don’t capture elements that you wouldn’t expect to be there (such as a giant red gorilla beating it’s chest on a basketball court). The Invisible Gorilla highlights how our minds deceive us, and leaves me with the takeaway to recognize that, as must as we want to believe that our memories are sound, we all have illusions.

It shows how your mind can play tricks on you through a series of stories and anecdotes, such as a rape victim who erroneously testify against a man that she was confident was the rapist or why we fail to see things that happen right in front of our eyes.The book is divided into 6 chapters that describe attention, knowledge, memory, confidence, cause and potential and goes on to debunk our most held believes in each of these areas. What I took away is that we must continually question what we know and what we think to be real and never jump to any casual conclusion between weakly correlated events."

It's a little scary to know that my mind can allow me to completely miss something going on right under my nose or remember things so obviously incorrectly. By midway through the book, however, I began to look forward to finishing it. Perhaps some of my own illusions are so great that I feel a bit insulted when confronted about them.
