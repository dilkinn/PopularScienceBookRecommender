There is no question that Musk is a special individual, someone with BIG dreams and the drive, talent, and money to make them happen. But, like Jobs, and Stark for that matter, he might be an acquired taste on a personal level. In Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future biographer Ashlee Vance gives us a picture of both the dreams and the man, peering back to where Musk began, describing his journey from then to now, looking at how he is impacting the world today, and gazing ahead to where he wants to go. It is a pretty impressive vista. Here is what it says on the SpaceX website
SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.
It might have seemed like visiting another planet when Musk split his home country of South Africa as a teen and headed to North America, anything to get away from an abusive upbringing. He seemed to have been blessed not only with exceptional analytical capabilities, and probably an eidetic memory, but an impressively immense set of cojones. He was able to talk his way into whatever he needed and deftly talk his way out of trouble as well. Sometimes that entailed a bit of truth-bending, but whatever. Ashlee Vance - from HarperCollins Vance take us from his adolescence as a computer geek, bullied at school, through his arrival in Canada, cold-calling to get work, putting together his first dot.com startup, and using the money from that to invest in a banking-oriented company that would become PayPal. It was the mega-bucks from the sale of PayPal that would allow him to begin realizing his big dreams. In 2003, Musk bought into Tesla, then a struggling startup. The company took the early knowledge that lithium ion batteries had gotten pretty good, added some top level engineering, design and programming talent, and, after plenty of mis-steps and struggles, brought the remarkable all-electric Tesla Roadster to the market in 2008. Tesla followed this with the Model S in 2012. Not only did Consumer reports call this a great car, it named both the 2014 and 2015 versions the best overall cars of their years, and the best car they had ever tested. The last time an auto startup succeeded in the USA was Chrysler, in the 1920s. But this is not about simply making a buck on a new car. The long term goal is to shift our petrochemical auto industry to renewable power, and the Tesla is a nifty start. Not only is the car amazing, the company has constructed a nationwide series of charging stations where Tesla owners can recharge their vehicles…for free. Tesla currently (August 2019) reports 1,604 such stations nationwide, with many more planned. Tesla is involved in building battery production factories, hoping to help support a growing electric-car auto-economy. Inside the Tesla Model S - from Tesla Motors But this was not the only big notion that drove Musk. A parallel effort was to develop a solar power business. And with the help of a couple of enterprising cousins, he did just that. SolarCity provides the solar arrays that provide power to the Tesla charging stations, but it has also become one of the largest solar utilities in the nation, installing, maintaining a third of the nation’s solar panel systems. There is obvious benefit to both Tesla and Solar City in sharing gains in battery and other technology. But I expect the third jewel in Musk’s crown is his favorite, SpaceX. Falcon 9 first stage attempting a controlled landing - from WikimediaMusk doesn’t have much going on here, nothing major, only an ardent desire to colonize Mars. But it takes the establishment of an infrastructure in order to be get from point E to point M. Musk saw an opening in the market for satellite launch vehicles. Existing rockets blast things up into orbit and then burn up on their way back down. His idea was to design a rocket that could make its way back to earth in one piece, to be reused. And he has. SpaceX is nearing its goal of launching at least one rocket a month. The manifest available on SpaceX.com lists missions to date. The company also designed a capsule called the Dragon that can be used for cargo, but also for astronauts. The cost of launching a satellite using a Falcon is a fraction of what other options charge. The next step is a larger launch vehicle. Space X has begun launching the Falcon Heavy rocket, offering the biggest load capacity since the Saturn V was last used in 1973. And, while this is definitely good for business in the relatively short term, one must always keep in mind that this is a stage in a bigger plan for Musk. Once the launch infrastructure is established, plans can begin to move forward to put together Mars missions. Not go, look, and explore sorts of adventures, but establishing a colony, a permanent human presence on the red planet. The Dragon Capsule, attached to the ISS - from Musk’s Twitter pageOf course when one has one’s eyes fixed on the stars (yes, Mars is a planet, I know, Geez), there is a large inclination to lose touch with earth-bound reality. In the movie, then play, then movie The Producers Max Bialystock, in order to cope with the absurd success of a play that was designed to fail, suggests to his partner, Leo Bloom, that one solution would be to do away with the cast. ""You can't kill the actors, Max! They're human beings,"" Leo says. ""Human beings? Have you ever seen them eat?"" Max replies. I suspect that there are more than a few folks who feel about Elon Musk the way Max felt about the actors. He is rather notorious for his insensitivity to anyone not living inside his head. For example, here is what potential recruits are told to expect when they meet with Musk.The interview, he or she is told, could last anywhere from thirty seconds to fifteen minutes. Elon will likely keep on writing e-mails and working during the initial part of the interview and not speak much. Don’t panic. That’s normal. Eventually, he will turn around in his chair to face you. Even then, though, he might not make actual eye contact with you or fully acknowledge your presence. Don’t panic. That’s normal. In due course, he will speak to you.
Musk has an amazing capacity for work, putting in monstrous hours as a matter of course. But then he expects the same from those who work for him.
 The rank and file employees…revere his drive and respect how demanding he can be. They also think he can be hard to the point of mean and come off as capricious. The employees want to be close to Musk, but they also fear that he’ll suddenly change his mind about something and that every interaction with him is an opportunity to be fired. “Elon’s worst trait by far, in my opinion, is a complete lack of loyalty or human connection,” said one former employee. “Many of us worked tirelessly for him for years and were tossed to the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought. Maybe it was calculated to keep the rest of the workforce on their toes and scared: maybe he was just able to detach from human connection to a remarkable degree. What was clear is that people who worked for him were like ammunition: used for a specific purpose until exhausted and discarded.”
Musk even fired his loyal assistant, Mary Beth Brown, who had been with him for twelve years, after she asked for a raise. What a guy.Ego is certainly a big piece of the picture here. But I guess if you can do it, it ain’t bragging. Elon Musk is a larger than life figure, a computer geek, an engineer, an entrepreneur, and a dreamer, in addition to being a walking IED as someone to work for. He is one of the inspirations for Robert Downey‘s portrayal of Tony Stark in sundry Marvel Universe films. In fact, Downey came to visit Musk, specifically to get a taste of what a real billionaire techno-industrialist was like. Downey insisted on having a Tesla Roaster on the set of Iron Man, saying, ”Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.” Musk even had a cameo in Iron Man II. The resulting publicity from this connection did little to diminish Musk’s view of himself. Living the high-life in Tinseltown, hanging with, social, economic and media A-listers added more gas to the bag. Part of his ego issue is that he tends to take internal company timetables and announce them to the world as promises (I can see his entire staff jointly rolling their eyes, clutching palms to temples and issuing choruses of “Oh my god” and “WTF” as they spin in place), then holds his employees to those unreasonable schedules. Of course this results in many missed deadlines, much ingestion of antacid and probably the odd nervous breakdown or two.Musk, in an Iron Man II cameo - fromWiredMusk is the sort of guy who shows up with some regularity in science fiction novels, a genre trope, like the researcher who has exactly the sort of experience and insight the President/PM/Chairman/Secretary General needs in order to stave off global catastrophe. He’s the guy who has been secretly building the arc that the world needs to stave off extinction. In this case he is doing it publicly. Of course this raises some issues. Do we as a country, as a planet, really want to be reliant on private companies for our space exploration? Do we want a possible colony on Mars to be a privately held branch of Musk Industries? There are only a gazillion questions that are raised by the privatization of space. What’s good for the bottom line at SpaceX may or may not be good for humanity. We have certainly seen how a reliance on the inherent civic-mindedness and good will of corporations has worked on this planet. Musk is a dreamer, for sure, and I expect his dream of making a better world through the use of renewable energy and his hopes of establishing a human outpost on Mars are pure ideals. But the devil is always in the details, and what would happen should Musk be infected by another virulent strain of malaria and not escape with a near miss, as he did in 2001? Would the replacement CEO share his ideals? Would a replacement CEO be willing to take big risks to support those ideals? Would a replacement CEO look to sell Tesla off to GM to make a few quick billion? One person can move the world, but it takes more than a start to keep things rolling. We could certainly use plenty more people with the sort of drive and ambition that Elon Musk embodies. Innovation is a rare resource and must be cherished. But like any powerful force, it must be, if not tethered, at least monitored, to make certain that it does not run amok. Ashlee Vance has done an amazing job of telling not only Musk’s story, but of making the life history of the several companies with which Musk has been involved fascinating reading. I did get the sense that Vance was, from all the time he spent with Musk, smitten with his subject. While his portrait of Musk is hardly a zit-free one, I got the feeling that there might be a few more skeletons safely tucked away in closets, a few more bodies buried in basements. Nevertheless, Elon Musk is a powerful, entertaining and informative look at one of the most important people of our time. Your personal vision of the future should certainly include checking out this book.=================EXTRA STUFF has been moved to comment #1"
1,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/991644-mark-bao,5,"Excellent and inspiring. This book brought up one key question: do you have to be a bit reckless to be good? Musk was reckless in two areas: in the risks he took, and the way that he manages his companies.As for the first, the number of near-death experiences that Tesla, SpaceX and earlier companies went through is almost a running joke throughout this story. The Falcon 1 failed three times, exhausting the company's funds, before achieving a successful fourth flight. Tesla avoided bankruptcy by taking on a NASA-approved loan from SpaceX plus a last-minute acquisition of a company Musk invested in pulled through, and avoided being derailed by a predatory investor by a bluff on the order of $40 million. Combine these with the many situations where it didn't look like Tesla was going to build anything substantial, plus the negative media attention—the fact that Musk continued to persevere and pull through at times where most normal people would have given up is crazy.This risk undoubtedly took a toll on his life and relationships, through three divorces and the insane sleep deprivation he and the others on the team go through. It brings up the question—when you're doing things as big as this, how reckless do you have to be? Should you have a breaking point? Does the sustainable, get-eight-hours-of-sleep-and-exercise approach really work? Or is the right thing to do actually to push through, get four hours of sleep, and get shit done? Are those that prefer the 'sustainable' option the ones that don't succeed as much, and the reckless ones the ones that actually make progress?As for the second, the way that he manages his companies, he was reckless in what he demanded from people. The most notable story is of SpaceX, where employees worked on a crappy atoll in the Marshall Islands for months to deliver the Falcon 1 rocket launches. In a Jobs-like fashion, his outward personality is cold, demanding, and fearful: employees are on edge all the time and have to have answers. If someone is the bottleneck on a project, there's immense pressure on them to deliver. And you never want to be the deliverer of bad news—and if you are, you better have a solution to back it up: The savvy engineers knew better than to go into a meeting and deliver bad news without some sort of alternative plan at the ready. “One of the scariest meetings was when we needed to ask Elon for an extra two weeks and more money to build out another version of the Model S,” Javidan said. “We put together a plan, stating how long things would take and what they would cost. We told him that if he wanted the car in thirty days it would require hiring some new people, and we presented him with a stack of resumes. You don’t tell Elon you can’t do something. That will get you kicked out of the room. You need everything lined up. (Loc 4277)And while that is actually a good way to work—to have everything lined up—is Musk's approach the right way to manage a company? Is it the only way to be successful on incredibly difficult things? Or are Tesla and SpaceX successful in spite of this way of working—that it actually holds people back?Other than those questions, this is a very good overview of Musk's life and personality, and the trials and tribulations he went through to be successful—a path beset by an immense number of setbacks and late deliveries.What comes through clearly is how much of a genius this guy was. To get a sense of what this guy is like, consider that in his childhood, he ran out of books to read at the local library and the school library, and sometimes would read for ten hours a day. Dude also has a memory that's not only photographic, but he can wrangle images and numbers and relationships between them in his head. Insane. His ability to ingest and retain information, and his approach to knowledge, is nuts: People who have spent significant time with Musk will attest to his abilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless recall. It’s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to work just as well in the present day as it did when he was a child vacuuming books into his brain. After a couple of years running SpaceX, Musk had turned into an aerospace expert on a level that few technology CEOs ever approach in their respective fields. (Loc 3421)What also comes across was how much Musk believes in the technological future and how much he as done to restore that promise to humanity. It's clear that he is one of the top people pushing technology and humanity forward, and that's incredibly inspiring.What I found a bit lacking in this book, which would have made this an excellent book, was more about Musk's inner life. Vance hypothesizes that Musk seems cold and non-emotional because he has a different sort of empathy than others: he emphasizes with the entire human species, and wants to do the most he can for them, but that makes him forget the individuals in front of him. But what does Musk think about this? How does Musk characterize his own values and experiences? Of course, this is something that few biographies do anyway, but for someone as dynamic as Musk, it would have been a welcome addition to the surface-level 'what he did' information.The guy's a genius, and this book, I think, represents that well. The inside look into Musk's life and work from the mid-2000s is thorough and really gives you a fantastic backstory into Musk's experience with Tesla and SpaceX. showing he did to make them successful, making this into an endlessly inspiring biography.FIVE STARS — Changed how I see things"
2,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2450538-louise,3,"3.5 StarsI like the can-do attitude Vance took with hounding Musk and wearing him down till he agreed to cooperate with this biography. I also appreciated all the ""Holy crap, Musk is CRAZY. CRAZY like a fox,"" moments I had while reading this. The only thing that keeps this from being a 4-star book is that the reporting and writing leans too heavily on idolatry. There were passages where I literally cringed at how much of a fanboy Vance sounded like."
3,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,"I found the tale of Elon Musk's childhood all the way through Zip, Paypal, Solar City, SpaceX and Tesla fascinating and inspiring. One thing in particular stood out. He's not motivated by greed. I've met my share of entrepreneurs and there are countless motivations that power these people. Some are narcissists, some like the idea of being in charge (ego), some are battling the demons of their parents (Musk most likely has a piece of this in his psyche), but the best ones are compulsive problem solvers. I liked the quote that Justine Musk mentioned when she said something to the effect: ""He's not trying to make money, it just happens for him."" Also, I'm no Elon Musk but I share his loathing of acronyms. They are blockers of communication. As an editor and a writer, clarity is key. Why lose someone in a meeting when they could be participating and applying to their brainpower to a problem? "

5,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Space. Renewable Energy. Internet. This is a man after my own heart. Out of all the super entrepreneurs and technological legends of the modern era, Musk ticks all the boxes on my dreams and passions, particularly space. Space has always been the frontier that intrigues me the most; for a single man to dream of colonising Mars and actually doing all he can to make that a reality is just simply astounding. And then of course, there is Tesla. Aside from the clean energy technology which I am a huge proponent of, how an electric car can become one of the most desirable and good-looking cars in the world is another example of the visionary genius that Musk is. As with all ideas that are so progressive in nature, the trials and tribulations faced by Musk were so daunting that most would've called it quits. His indomitable will and spirit, however, sets him apart from the ordinary. He is very demanding on himself, being extremely hands-on, and also of his employees. Then again, how else are you going to change the world by compromising on the high standards that one sets for oneself.Notwithstanding his crazy but awesome ideas (first, the Hyperloop and now, Neuralink) the one thing that differentiates him from most current entrepreneurs is that he really seeks to change the world. He is not in it just for short term gain, which is what a lot of businesses are doing right now. A simple case in point is Tesla's open source patent. I'll stop gushing about Musk now and talk a bit about the biography itself. The conversational tone employed by the author translated well into audio, and the narrator did a good enough job that it didn't sound monotonous. The biography was written from extensive interviews conducted with a plethora of his ex-employees, and the people closest to Musk. This enabled a more independent and less biased insight from one which was self-penned (not that I believe Musk will ever have the time to do so). The biography was also quite educational; while I still do not know how to build a rocket or an electric car now I've gained a better understanding of certain technical aspects of these items and how they work.Whether you're a fan of Musk, or just intrigued by his ideas and achievements, or even if you only just desired the Tesla badly, this is a recommended read.This review can also be found at Booknest"
6,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,5,"Let me offer this thought: SpaceX is the coolest and most exciting company in the world at this moment in time.Yes, Tesla is also extremely cool. And inspiring. But nothing can beat that feeling of power, wonder and deep inspiration that SpaceX will give you as soon as you start to understand what that company is actually doing. As Vance says, ""SpaceX IS Elon Musk"". So who is this man? How is it humanly possible to achieve what he has achieved? What else can he achieve in the future? Will he become the richest man on Earth? Or on Mars? Not only this book is written in a very passionate and engaging way. I also find that it is a very important book for anyone who is at least a little curious about our present and our future.In fact, I believe Ashlee Vance’s portrait of Elon Musk is a necessary read for anyone, because of the effect that his companies are having on the automotive, the clean energy, and the space industries. If these companies are not changing the future, at the very least they are accelerating our pace towards it.Vance starts out in a ballsy way, stating that he won't budge: he will write whatever he wants, however he wants it. As I got to the end of the book, I had a strong feeling that this is not exactly the case, and that a lot has been left out. However, the information that is in the book is absolutely fascinating. It is the first biography I've ever read that I would categorize as a real ""page-turner"". The ""missing facts"" that stand out the most in my opinion are:1) Childhood troubles. Musk keeps referring to a very painful and troubled childhood, but in the book all we get is some bullying and social awkwardness. Plus, a father who was ""psychologically"" abusive. There are many unanswered questions there, and I think Vance chose to be respectful and not dig too deeply. Or he just didn’t get anything about that out of Musk. 2) The miraculous last-minute save of both Tesla and SpaceX in 2008: not enough details. Something crucial seems to be missing. Whether it is a few private donors who poured in extra millions, or some other turn of fate. I don't know if Vance knows what is missing there, but something is missing. Overall, Elon Musk comes across as a normal human being with exceptional ambition, exceptional luck, exceptional physical energy, exceptional intelligence and exceptional confidence in his vision. He is an inspiration for many, and beyond Elon Musk, his companies and his vision are a huge inspiration. Did you notice how the most popular fictional depictions of the future (YA, etc.) in this day and age are pessimistic, dystopian, self-hating like teenagers? Well, Elon Musk is offering us a window into a future that is the exact opposite of that. Very similar to Arthur Clarke, my favorite author, another optimistic visionary. Musk's vision of the future is so bright that reminds me of the golden age of science fiction, when Clarke and Asimov were writing, when people had the courage to dream beautiful, positive dreams about the future. It sounds like an advertisement for a soap, but yes ----- with Musk, the future is bright again. Finally, I have a comment about ""being a nerd"": in the first part of the book, the kid Elon Musk is called a ""nerd"" about a million times. Why is it that in America (and in South Africa, as it seems) a very smart kid who is into reading a lot instead of playing sports, invariably, is called a ""nerd""? The fact that this word DOES NOT EXIST and cannot be translated into many European languages tells us something about America. I think Isaac Asimov was onto somehting when he said: ""The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.” -----------------------Btw, great to find out that Robert Zubrin was a big influence on Musk. He is the head of the Mars Society, a man who has been thinking about going to Mars for much longer than Elon Musk has. I read Zubrin's ""The case for Mars"" many years ago, and I was utterly fascinated by it."
7,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4," 4.5 starsBillionaire Elon Musk is a businessman, engineer, and inventor with a radical vision for the future of mankind. In fact Musk wants nothing less than to establish a human colony on Mars.....with a view toward exploring Jupiter's moon Europa someday. Jupiter and EuropaMusk fears there will be another mass extinction event - like the asteroid that destroyed 75% of Earth's species at the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary 65 million years ago - and he wants people to have somewhere to go. There was a mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene BoundaryI agree with Musk that Earth is likely to become inhospitable to humans someday, but I fear we'll ruin the planet ourselves - with over-exploitation, pollution, war, and disease. (And then we'd probably do the same thing to Mars. I'm a skeptic.)In any case, Musk puts his money where his mouth is. In 2002 the audacious entrepeneur founded the rocket company SpaceX. SpaceX is already launching satellites for several countries, and carrying supplies to the International Space Station. SpaceXIn the future, Musk wants rockets to bring people, equipment, and provisions to the red planet.....ideally in the next 50 to 100 years. SpaceX is just one of Musk's far-sighted enterprises. In this book Ashlee Vance explores Musk's various business ventures, and provides insight into the developer's character and personal life. Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971. He had a difficult childhood, being viciously bullied at school and tormented by his father, Errol. The book has few details about Errol's behavior (no one will talk about it), but it's revealing that grandpa Musk isn't allowed to meet Elon's five sons. Elon Musk's father ErrolAs a youngster Elon devoured books, and - with his photographic memory - recalled everything he read. Elon was also an inventive child who built rockets and created video games. Little Elon MuskWhen he was 17-years-old Elon moved to his mother's home country, Canada.....and the penniless teen bunked with relatives, did odd jobs, and went to school. Young Elon MuskEventually, Elon ended up at the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in economics and physics. Musk then moved to California and entered the business world.Vance did extensive research and describes Musk's business projects in elaborate detail, including: how they started; financing; development; failures; successes; leadership; personnel; buy-outs; etc. Musk's trajectory didn't go straight from start-up to billionaire. Far from it. In fact the developer nearly went bankrupt several times....to the glee of naysayers and jealous rivals. Musk carried on, though, and was successul in the end. (So yay Elon!....and pooh on the guys who tried to take him down!)In this brief review I'll just provide a quick summary of Musk's business activities. For a full picture, you'll have to read the book.Musk's first venture after college was Zip2 - a kind of online Yellow Pages/Mapquest that allowed users to find businesses and get directions. When Zip2 was sold, Musk founded an internet banking venture that became PayPal. These were profitable pursuits that provided money for additional investments. Musk founded SpaceX - the aforementioned rocket company in 2002, and co-founded Tesla Motors - which manufactures environmentally friendly electric cars in 2003. Then, in 2006, Musk helped his cousins launch SolarCity - a company that fabricates, markets, and installs solar panels. Among other things, Tesla and SolarCity are meant to reduce the use of fossil fuels and lower carbon pollution....which would help preserve the Earth and its inhabitants. In this vein, Musk also hopes to build 'hyperloops' - high speed trains that travel on a loop between major cities like New York and Washinton DC; and Los Angeles and San Francisco. President Obama is said to be a fan of this project. HyperloopMusk's various ventures require smart, capable personnel and the developer was (and is) always on the lookout for the brightest students, the best engineers, the most foreward-thinking inventors, and so on. Elon Musk giving commencement addressCaltech students Musk is notoriously difficult to work for and - when he wants something done - refuses to hear ""I can't do it."" If you really can't do it, Musk is likely to let you go and do it himself. Musk expects employees to work long hours without complaint.....and has a reputation for upbraiding and firing personnel. Thus, he's quite ruthless on a business level.Elon Musk is notoriously hard to work with In private life, though, Musk is said to be a fun guy who likes to make jokes; laugh; attend costume parties; play video games with his kids; and generally have a good time. Musk has five sons - twins and triplets - from his first marriage to Justine Musk and is now wed to the actress Tallulah Riley. The entrepeneur has a brutal work schedule - he often works 100 or more hours per week - but takes his sons all over the world with him. Musk is also close to his brother and cousins, and often collaborates with them on business projects. Elon Musk's first wife Justine MuskElon Musk with his second wife Tallulah RileyElon Musk with his sonsIn addition to influencing national and international corporations, Musk has impacted popular culture. After the actor, Robert Downey Jr., visited the SpaceX factory, he modeled aspects of his character 'Tony Stark' (Iron Man) on the billionaire entrepreneur. And Musk guest starred on an episode of 'The Simpsons' called 'The Musk Who Fell to Earth.' The Simpsons segment is hilarious and gives a cartoonish - but probably accurate....picture of the entrepreneur as an imaginative inventor and concerned citizen of the Earth. (The episode is available on YouTube.) Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (Iron Man)Elon Musk on The SimpsonsVance's discussions of the ups and downs of Musk's businesses are especially well-researched and interesting. The author explains how Tesla ultimately built an electric roadster that's beautiful, comfortable, kid-seat friendly, and (more or less) reasonably-priced (if you're rich); and how a rocket was finally launched after heartbreaking failures due to mechanical errors, sloshing fuel, and other hard-to-foresee factors. Vance also discusses the problems involved when private companies - like Musk's enterprises - compete with established (though inferior) businesses that have government support. Some corporations are beloved by politicians because of monetary contributions, lobbyists, factories in their districts; etc. It's hard to compete with such companies, and they caused massive headaches for Musk. But, of course, he prevailed in the end. I admire Musk for his brilliance and accomplishments, and I like this book. I'd recommend the book to readers interested in Elon Musk; his far-reaching business ventures; and the future of the planet. You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."

As in Atlas Shrugged. Sure, he's also Dagney, too, or perhaps more like Dagney in that he's unwilling to let humanity roll around in the mud despite all the backstabbing and idiocracy, in that he hasn't said, ""enough is enough"". But the day is young. Wait until we get to Mars. Wait until we really take the man of genius and effort for granted. And THEN we'll see what we'll miss once it is taken away.Ahhh, I don't want to see this man out of classic SF heroes become anything other than his stated goals. I'll be honest here. He's giving me real hope for humanity. Maybe optimism *isn't* unfounded after all.This biography tells me one hell of a great narrative. Is it life imitating art? The best ideals from the grandmasters? Who knows. But right now, I have real hope. I'm holding on to it for my very soul. :)Let's MAKE the future we wanted. Let's NOT let anything stand in our way!HELL YAH!"

“It’s nuts that people would want to vilify Elon. He might say some things that rub people the wrong way, but at some point, the being nice to everyone thing doesn’t work.“
Elon Musk is fascinating. I could simply tick off some biographical points such as him having been married twice and having five children with his first wife (a set of twins and a set of triplets), but that is not why I read biographies and, in fact, why I dislike most of them. Either the people the biographies are about aren’t really interesting (actors barely in their 30s for example) or it really is just a list of facts that I could read on Wikipedia as well.This biography about Elon Musk is different. He is different. He’s only 47 but has lived through and accomplished more than other people could in 3 lifetimes.He grew up during a very violent period in South Africa. Granted, he’s white and the family was never truly poor, but it was still dangerous. He was also bullied in school (like, beaten bloody) and suffered the intense mind games of his father. Later, he went to Stanford university for only one day before leaving again. He, his way of life, his ideas and his ambition are very unconventional. From what I understand, he is still the little boy reading comics and dreaming of humanity conquering and colonizing the stars. And that is his mission in life that he has dedicated everything to. Some might call this silly but great minds like Stephen Hawking agree(d) with Musk that it’s the only way humanity will have a future and we do need a champion that is driving us, giving us a chance at survival. Once upon a time, we all had this dream of reaching the stars, but it has since dwindled thanks mostly to politics and peoples' tendency to give up when something is hard. Musk knows that getting humanity to Mars and beyond also means creating technology that will automatically enhance and better life here on Earth. There are many who can influence consumers and create new trends, but Musk isn’t here for exploiting a moment and getting rich - he’s poured ALL of his money, time and time again, into his businesses when they were in trouble and went much farther than any „expert“ thought sane, just to reach his ultimate goal (a colony on Mars). Simply put: he has proven that he’s not afraid to give up or at least risk everything, unlike most entrepreneurs. It’s no surprise, then, that his three main businesses are Tesla (electric cars), SolarCity (renewable energy), and SpaceX (aerospace industry).Before getting to create the above mentioned companies, he founded zip2, which became part of AltaVista eventually, as well as X.com of PayPal fame, but was forced out. I won’t go into detail but it seems kind of a trend that people get enthused by Musk, get rich by his skills - and then force him out because they simply wish to cash in and don’t share his vision. Backstabbing galore throughout his career. It’s sickening.I admit that it sounds as if he was a very difficult man to work with but that is no excuse for such behaviour and his success shows that his way of doing things works! Every time he has an idea, people say he’s nuts and that it cannot work - and then he proves them wrong.
„Good ideas are always crazy - until they’re not.“ Larry Page, Google co-founder.Short-term, inconsequential goals are trending nowadays from normal people to the highest politicians. In this environment, a radical visionary like Musk steps on many toes and quite often, too.It can’t be easy to be ridiculed and stabbed in the back all the time. However, he thinks that that plus his childhood suffering actually helped him to become who he is today. And I see what makes him think so. Without adversity, there is no challenge to overcome the danger/problem so you stagnate. It sounds a bit like Darwin’s theory of evolution. 
„Elon is one of the few people that I feel is more accomplished than I am.“ Craig Venture, the man who de-coded the human genome and went on to create synthetic lifeforms.Radical. Visionary. Musk has haters and fans alike. He was even called the real-life Iron Man (albeit an Iron Man who sacked his Pepper Potts).His life goals certainly are very compelling if you care about the future at all and refuse to be tied down by the comfortable excuse of it being hard or costly. If you look at historical visionaries that have catapulted humanity forward, I’d say they were all more or less „difficult“ people and especially after seeing the Heavy Falcon rocket being operated successfully only recently (a fact that sadly didn’t make it into this biography as it was published earlier), I believe he can pull it off and certainly hope he can.I, personally, like how well-read Musk is, that he seems to be a technological allrounder, that he is right there in the factories working at least as many hours as he expects from everybody else and getting his hands dirty like any other worker (often ruining expensive Italian leather shoes to the horror of the people around him), that he has such an unbendable will (though I'm sorry it has cost him so much already), that he is playing video games in his spare time when he's not taking care of his kids (because he seems to be quite a good father as well), and that he is a big nerd and geek.As can be seen by him not only shooting one of his sports cars into space, that gets ""steered"" by a ""space man"" (Bowie reference) recently or by him storing a very nice collection of scifi literature onto the car's bord computer, but also by him programming said bord computer to display Douglas Adams' immortal words.This biography was written in a very compelling way by a man with an apparent vast knowledge of the history and inner workings of various industries (the author has worked for several well-known business papers for many years). The book also shows a great deal of research. Some authors manage to bore me even when talking about interesting people but Ashlee Vance has a unique style and I like the red thread throughout the book and that he doesn’t shy away from also showing the more problematic sides of Musk’s character."
10,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24816039-umut-rados,3,"Whether you follow him or his companies/works, Elon Musk is an important innovator of our times, and I would suggest everyone to read this book to get inspired or experience another world. I really admire how Vance captured his biography, which is not an easy thing to do. If you read a little bit, you'll understand Musk is not the most easy going person in the world. The author opens the book in a very intriguing way starting from why Musk allowed him to write his biography, which starts to shed some light into his character. It was really interesting to read about how SpaceX, Tesla and all his other success stories started, how he jumped from one ambition to another, and how he runs his companies. Obviously, Musk is no normal person. He runs after his heart, and his dreams. He's not only after making a lot of money, but he wishes a self-sufficient world before he leaves it himself. I do admire how he uses his intellect, his efforts and resources to do innovations that would be good for the earth. Clean technology, colonisation in Mars, solar power, etc. He's probably one of the most persistent person I've ever read about. All the difficulties he's thrown at would make any one of us to give up, but he still goes after his dreams. He's tough, both on himself and his employees. It's not easy to work for him. But, yet again, it's also not easy to aim to change how the world operates. So, we can't expect ordinary from him. All in all, I would really suggest this book to anybody. It's interesting, fascinating, very well captured inner world of this genius I truly admired even more than before I read this book. Thanks a lot to NetGalley and the publisher for granting a free copy in exchange for an honest review."
11,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6229140-s-tom-cebic,3,"I wish I could rate this book 2.5 stars. It's a great long read Atlantic or Wired piece about a visionary person with an interesting childhood that is at the forefront of a technology shift and an unsuccessful emotional biography. There are a ton of details about Elon's upbringing, especially about his father and brother, who always felt like a mystery to me. I got a good understanding of how Elon's early mentor, a Canadian banking executive, gave him some insights towards starting X.com, a service I had dearly loved but didn't seem to jive with his later projects. There were interesting details on the mind boggling progress SpaceX made when building their initial Falcon rockets. In short I learned a lot about the progress of Elon's companies, but very little about what motivated him to start them or continue after making his first billion. It's hard not to compare this book to Walter Isaacson's 'Jobs, not only because the structure of the book is similar but Vance seems to reach for the same informal and intimate tone. Isaacson was able to give us a real glimpse into Jobs's growth as a person and a real insight into Steve's thinking. Vance gives us a chronology of Elon's life, a superficial overview of the technology that anyone with more than a layman's interest already knows, and adds his own often peremptory commentary on Musk's motivations and accomplishments. It straddles a funny line between objective reporting and jokey insider tell-all. I think it falls on both fronts as Vance does a very skin deep overview of the technology that SpaceX and Tesla have pioneered and a lot of the jokey comments come off as non-sequitor. In a way I learn more about him than Elon. Elon's companies are important enough to our future than any new information about him and his motivations is well worth a read. I hope someone else takes on the topic with a little more depth and a little less personality. "
12,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86362-amar-pai,5,"Really enjoying this book, but I'm struck by how Musk, like Jobs and Bezos, is a total asshole. A Space-X employee missed a work event to witness his child's birth, and Musk calls him on the carpet for it. He expects his employees to have no life and discards people as soon as they're no longer useful. Just a nightmare boss. Not somebody I'd ever want to work with. Apparently I'm not the only one who had this thought. From NY Times: The Bad Behavior of Visionary LeadersAs I was reading Ashlee Vance’s “Elon Musk: Tesla, Space X and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,” I was alternately awed and disheartened, almost exactly the same ambivalence I felt after reading Walter Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” and Brad Stone’s “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.”The three leaders are arguably the most extraordinary business visionaries of our times. Each of them has introduced unique products that changed – or in Mr. Musk’s case, have huge potential to change – the way we live.I was awed by the innovative, courageous, persistent and creative ways all three built their businesses. I also love their products. I own a Mac Pro and an iPhone, and I have been a loyal customer of Apple for 20 years. I buy many books and other products on Amazon, lured by a blend of low prices, ease of purchase and reliably quick delivery. The Tesla Model S is hands down the best car I have ever driven, and it’s all electric, rechargeable in your garage.Plainly, I have bought in to what these guys are selling.What disheartens me is how little care and appreciation any of them give (or in Mr. Jobs’s case, gave) to hard-working and loyal employees, and how unnecessarily cruel and demeaning they could be to the people who helped make their dreams come true.All three of these dudes are clearly geniuses who have advanced the state of the art and changed the world. iPhone, amazon, ehhhh tesla (jury's out). But I have to believe you could get there without treating your employees like shit.Is it a patriarchy/male thing? Who knows. Maybe female billionaire tycoons are all assholes too.Kudos to the first self-made billionaire who manages to change the game multiple times (at the level of iphone/pixar, tesla/space x, amazon/kindle) WITHOUT abusing employees and trampling people's lives. It has to be possible"
13,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3035194-lubinka-dimitrova,5,"This is an incredibly inspiring book, a important look into a game-changing worldview, and a valuable lesson to the world. As Musk says, ""If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.""Strangely enough, I've followed Space X' and Tesla's progress for a very long time, but I never actually read many things about the person behind them. I still cannot believe what a visionary Elon Musk is, and how persistent he's about anything he does. He is a mad scientist, inventor, business mogul and visionary all at the same time, and all these play equally important role in his life. For obvious reasons, his - let's say - philanthropy strikes the most sensitive chord in anyone who's even remotely troubled by what's going on on this planet. His philanthropic vision though does not consist in giving his billions away, but in trying to make his businesses succeed in order to save humanity from itself, before the planet we live on collapses. “He’s the possessed genius on the grandest quest anyone has ever concocted. He’s less a C.E.O. chasing riches than a general marshaling troops to secure victory. Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to ... well ... save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation."" Mr. Vance curbs his enthusiasm and delivers a well-calibrated portrait of Mr. Musk. The best thing about the book is that it tells Elon Musk’s story simply and well. It’s the story of an intelligent man, for sure. But more so it is the story of a determined one. The insights into the respective industries are truly compelling - Mr. Vance brings us up to date on the states of green energy and space launches. He also veers away from his subject just often enough, offering profiles of the frequently brilliant people who work alongside Mr. Musk.I'm so very pleased that many of the things discussed in the book as future plans are already happening (safely reusing rockets is one step nearer after the successful landing of Falcon 9 in April, while the first affordable electric car that's more attractive than the best sport cars was unveiled in March, and it has a price tag of 35 000 USD). I'm too old to hang a poster of Musk in my bedroom, but I've found a new crush, and I'll continue to follow his progress in awe and admiration. Humanity may still have a chance. "
14,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"Google’s Larry Page says that ’Good ideas are always crazy until they are not’ and this is a statement of truth. If before 2007, someone were audacious enough to tell you that a mobile phone made in the US will turn the industry on its head then you would have called that a crazy notion. If prior to 1998, someone would have said that a website will come along and would grow beyond its role as a search engine into a part of life itself that would have been called crazy too. Every other thing from a light bulb to a movie to a car to sliced bread were all crazy ideas at one time. It only took an individual or a group to persist through this period of ridicule and name calling to finally make these crazy notions come to life .Then there is this man : Elon Musk .His dreams of cheaper space travel, sustainable and clean energy and electric cars were laughed off as the dreams of just another batshit crazy Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Elon founded one company, took over another and invested in a third all three of which were called epic fails by the industry pundits. Time however proved Elon right and all three companies (SpaceX, Tesla and Solar City)are now stuff of lore. How did these companies manage to break through against all these odds and how did Elon manage to drive them to achieve more and more- this is the crux of this book.To me this book was more about SpaceX and Tesla than Elon’s biography. I did come across a lot of articles that detailed his management style, the apparent lack of empathy and of pushing people to the last shreds of their performance but the ultimate vision that these companies embody might not be compatible to a softer management style. Take SpaceX, whose stated vision is to make human beings as a multiplanetary race in the days to come. This is one of the grandest, loftiest visions a company can have as its raison d'être . Now this is a binary vision as in you either make it to space and colonize or you fail as a company. The objective is monstrously big and for a company striving to reach it there can be no excuses or compromises. Everybody breaks their back working to get human beings to space. Elon, who heads the company and who formulated the vision then works double hard and puts in twice more than any other employee to move closer to realizing that vision. Slips in performance from individuals or teams will not be tolerated and Musk & Co burn through employees like firewood. You can look at it from the perspective of a conventional organization and say that such a methodology is bad for you but then there are loads of talented people waiting in line to be hired into SpaceX or Tesla to get their hands on these projects. This by no means is a justification for abrasive management practices from Musk or for the gruelling work hours of these firms. But truth be told complacency was what unseated the competitors for both these organizations. Ashlee Vance makes an analogy by comparing the industry placidity that surrounded iPhones. When the iPhone came out, everyone called it an overpriced rich man’s toy and were quick to downcast it. But then it blazed ahead and disrupted the entire mobile phone industry. Even with an iPhone in hand, companies like HTC and Samsung took years to come close to a comparable design or user interface. Now use this perspective in SpaceX and you see Musk & Co. shaking up years of bureaucratic dust when they cut the cost of commercial space flight to a fraction of what it was before and Tesla blows competition out of the water with their automobile design and efficiency.Elon Musk’s ideas for a better future of mankind is cleaner, effective and makes abundant use of technology. Therein also lies its biggest impediment for almost all of it hinges on this one man alone. Musk is not immortal and we really cannot predict what the companies policies might evolve into post his time. They already employ an army of workers and hence bring in tremendous clout in the US but it remains to be seen what these organizations will stand for in the years to come. Humanity is too large and too volatile to be bracketed into users and non-users of these commodities alone.The book is highly readable especially since Elon is enjoying the status of a rock star celebrity at the moment. Vance writes in a way which tries to capture the essence of this man while not sounding like a sycophant. It is only towards the end that I felt Vance tries his hands at speculating as to why Elon is not empathetic and his explanation did not appear all too convincing to me. I suppose a few prejudices of the man himself rubbed off on the author with a most notable case being references to Jeff Bezos. There is no love lost between Musk and Bezos with the end result being that the book does not have a great deal of good to talk about Bezos. It is also very inspiring to know about a man who overcame such huge odds to survive and single-mindedly pursue an objective relentlessly.Recommended."
15,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith,4,"A couple of weeks ago I was glued to my television set as SpaceX launched its Falcon 9 rocket, carrying two astronauts on their journey to the International Space Station. The launch was followed shortly thereafter by the amazing spectacle of seeing the main body of the rocket separate before flipping and completing a descent, culminating in a vertical landing on an autonomous drone ship. This still feels to me like something out of a sci-fi movie – I’m hardly able to believe what I’m seeing! A few days later Audible offered up a cheapie listen to this bio of the company’s founder and driving force, Elon Musk. And, of course, not only is Musk the man behind America’s return to manned space travel he also runs Tesla, a company producing high-end electric cars. Oh, and let’s not forget SolarCity, a subsidiary of Tesla that specialises in providing solar energy services. That’s quite a collection.Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971 and from an early age he demonstrated an ability to absorb and retain a huge volume of information. A prodigious reader, he regularly immersed himself in books for up to ten hours a day. As a young boy he wasn’t considered hugely sociable and his habit of routinely correcting other children was hardly going to help him develop an extensive group of school friends. He developed into a geeky adolescent who enjoyed science fiction and fantasy stories. Shortly before his 18th birthday he set off for Canada on his own and from there made his way to America. After obtaining degrees in physics and economics and completing two internships in Silicon Valley he toyed with the idea of beginning doctorate studies before giving that up to launch a web software company called Zip2, in 1995. After pocketing $10 million from the sale of Zip2 he co-founded an online financial services and email payment company (X.com) which through a merger acquired a money-transfer service called PayPal. A couple of years later Musk was ousted as CEO but in the shakeout he received circa $165 million. This was to be his set-up money for SpaceX and Tesla. Musk had developed into a visionary who believed that to safeguard the human race it would be necessary to build a multi-planetary society – his planet of choice being Mars. Furthermore, he was enthused by the idea building an electric car after test driving a handmade electric sports car. The makers had no interest in mass producing the car but Musk believed in the concept of a future in which cars were no longer powered by petrol or diesel.This book walks us through Elon’s involvement in both companies, and to a lesser extent the development of SolarCity too. Not surprisingly, he comes across as daring and hugely driven. He rates high on his ability to maximise output from his teams – he recruits highly skilled people, expects them to work long days and accepts no resistance to his lofty targets and goals. But he can be harsh in dealing with his employees and it seems that though almost all respect (and often revere) their boss, it doesn’t necessarily mean they like him. As a leader he is adept at developing a big picture strategy but, unusual for high flying CEO’s, he’s also totally comfortable delving into the fine detail. And there are quite a few examples here describing how Musk uses his photographic memory to the consternation of those around him: in one example he provided feedback on a prototype car, listing around 80 elements requiring attention – all without having taken any notes. The book was published in 2015, so it doesn’t cover elements that have made the news in the past few years. But what is clear here is just how daring the man is. He is not afraid to go ‘all in’ when investing in his companies, though this nearly cost him dear in 2008 when both SpaceX and Tesla were on the verge of financial collapse. He has also managed to augment his skills as a physicist and an engineer with an eye for design. He’s a man with a big ego and this can sometimes get in the way but his drive and focus ensure that his eyes (and those of his team) are always firmly set on the prize. It’s a fascinating story and sits beside those featuring the likes of Steve Jobs and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin as another testament to the bright, insightful entrepreneurs Silicon Valley has produced."

However, eventually I extremely relish this book that I cannot put it down.Takeaways:1. There is nothing wrong about being an introvert and enjoying reading books. You will find a lot of inspirations for your career. Don't give up your childhood dream.2. Working hard is the only way that lead to success. I vividly remember that he has to take about 170 flights a year. Thanks for his hard work, he contributes tremendously to our modern world. Musk is the founder of SpaceX, co-founder of Zip 2, Paypal, Tesla and SolarCity.3. Always seek to minimize monopoly in every industry. SpaceX helps US government save a lot of money to lauch satellites, instead of relying on Russian providers."
17,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24868971-cassie,4,"I’m super interested in Elon Musk and this book provided me insight into the way he thinks, what drives him, how he gets things done, etc. Some small criticisms--There were times I noticed information that was being repeated, which made it feel like Vance may have written each chapter separately or without certainty of what order the chapters would be included in the book. Also, while I liked the conversational tone of the writing, it was not what I’m used to from biographies.A larger criticism—I don’t know if Vance intended to write this book as a disinterested third party, but it was evident to me that by the end, he was too close to his subject to do so. Musk’s “failures”—his cold dealings with people, his tendency to lose the trees in the forest (which is 100% not how that saying goes), his ruthlessness with people who have sacrificed a great deal for his business and his dreams—are treated as necessary (and therefore forgivable) for the incredibly amazing things Musk has decided to do with his life and money. And while I think I agree, I’m not sure that I wanted the biographer to make that decision for me. After reading this book, it’s easy for me to forgive all of Musk’s interpersonal failures because I’m inspired by the things he dreams up, the way he pursues the “impossible” things, and the fact that he has found a purpose in life and doesn’t let things like money and celebrity distract him from that purpose. However, I’m not a casualty of these failures and can’t imagine that I’d like to be written off so easily if I was.Okay, this hasn’t sounded like a 4-star review so far, but let me assure you that this book is interesting, well researched, has insight that I presume only Silicon Valley insiders had before, and is incredibly inspiring."
18,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671638-sharon,4,"Ironically, one of the quotes that made the biggest impression on me in Elon Musk: Inventing the Future didn't come from Musk, but from data scientist Jeffrey Hammerbacher: ""The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.""I mean, da-amn. This is so true. (And it stung even more because I'm a marketer.) Where have we gone wrong as a generation? Where is the passion and quest for knowledge? What is the real purpose of innovation? To improve mankind or to become wealthy? Can we have both?I've long been a fan of Musk; his name comes up quite a bit in my geeky circle and is always spoken with reverence: from Tesla, SpaceX, PayPal, Solar City, The Boring Company... this is a techno-utopian fellow who wants to affect real change in the world. Despite any character flaws (and the book points out many), it's real hard not to respect the guy.I listened to the audiobook, and even at 392 pages unabridged, this super-accessible biography felt too short. I couldn't wait to go on my lunchtime walks and weekend drives so I could hear what Crazy Elon was up to next. My biggest issue was how out-of-date the book--published in 2015--already is (gotta be hard keeping up with Musk!). Among my beef: 1) Author Ashlee Vance talks only briefly about Musk's desire to build pod-like vehicles to propel through reduced-pressure tubes (Hyperloop); 2) He doesn't mention The Boring Company (his tunnel-digging company) at all, and 3) Perhaps the most egregious, there is a blue-sky conversation about Musk's desire to reuse rockets (this was done to great fanfare in March of this year), as well as to land these rockets with accuracy on floating launch pads (droneships)... SpaceX has now performed this feat multiple times. This minor annoyance can't really be helped, though. I'd much rather read about Musk now as opposed to waiting until he's done inventing.I'm not even going to attempt to summarize Musk's life or the book - it's a captivating read, and one I'd recommend to anyone interested in Musk, electric cars, space travel and/or colonizing Mars. I've noted some interesting tidbits below (please let me know if there are any inaccuracies; I didn't catch all of the details from the audio):Musk was and still is an avid reader. Among his childhood favorites: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Foundation, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.Musk doesn't characterize himself as an investor; he's interested in making technologies he thinks are important and will change the world in some way. For instance, he seriously considered going into game design and programming, but didn't think the cause was noble enough or that it would help change the world. He's also long been interested in the internet, solar energy and space: he didn't just stumble upon the fields as the ""next hot thing.""His big takeaway from his stint as a banker, pre PayPal: Bankers ""are rich and dumb."" He's demanding and difficult to work with: there's a long line of people who will go on record to say they hate him, and those who will follow him anywhere. He requires little sleep and has an undisputed work ethic. After a particularly grueling period at Tesla, engineers were told by Musk to rework a design yet again, sacrificing their weekends and sleeping under their desks if necessary. An employee pushed back and asked when they would be allowed to see their families. Musk's answer: ""They’ll get to see their families a lot... when we go bankrupt.""Tesla's Model S stereo volume goes to 11: a nod to This is Spinal Tap.He's not a fan of Amazon's Jeff Bezos and scoffed at his secretive Blue Origin space program, particularly irked by Bezos's desire to patent everything under the sun. In summation. ""He's just not a fun guy.""He'd like to spend his final days on Mars and not come back: ""If my wife and I had a bunch of kids, she would probably stay with them on Earth."" (!!!)The retirement of our space shuttle has made us reliant on Russia, who (as of 2015), charge us $70 million per person for the trip to the International Space Station.Musk went to Russia multiple times, looking to buy rockets for SpaceX. When he was repeatedly quoted astronomical (heh) figures, he decided to build his own.He refuses to take SpaceX public until a viable plan to go to Mars (his ultimate goal) is secure.The early engineers of SpaceX were rock stars. They flew to Kwaj (Kwajalein Island, in the Marshall Islands), and were tasked with building a launch site. The early days were likened to Gilligan's Island... with rockets. Musk would agree or refuse essential material requests from the U.S.: one denied request was a paved area that would allow engineers to transport the rocket to the launch site more easily. Engineers were instead forced to go the way of the ancient Egyptians, laying boards down, and wheeling the rocket on top of it, with the last board moved to the front, and then the last board moved to the front again, and so on and so on.United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing (who joined forces because they thought there wasn't enough government work to go around), is pretty much an embarrassment to the U.S. During a 2015 Congressional hearing, Musk claimed ULA charged $380 million per rocket launch. ...with SpaceX charging a mere $90 million ($30 million more than they would typically charge due to strict government protocol)."
19,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,4,"A very insightful account on a man who wants to reach the stars (well, Mars) and save humanity from extinction and global warming, yet often falls short from showing a modicum of kindness toward his employees and prone to going ballistic over typos in emails and abbreviations. Oh, did I mention he is downright mysoginistic as well? He basically said all smart women must breed and he's the alpha in his marriage. The book provides succinct insights on the situation surrounding the industries the mercurial Musk works in: automotive, finance, power generation, and aerospace. Admittedly, most of them had become bureaucratic, imploding, sunset industries, and had not shown any significant achievements for decades. Musk changed it, with his then-crazy ideas and gung-ho attitudes which include over optimistic deadlines and clashes with friends and employees who did not suit him. He made those happened nonetheless. Not just a big talker, but also a doer. I wish he could be more humane about all of it but his vision seems to be more abstract - future humanity - than taking a good care of people surrounding him (including his loyal ex-secretary, his own Pepper Potts) and himself, all the people in the now that could bring that grand vision to life. If you want to bring changes to the world, you need to start from yourself and people surrounding you then work from that gradually. Anyway, I am an idealistic nobody, so what do I know. Semi-philosophical rambling aside, this is a recommended read for those who love innovation (or disrupt) and how to get there. The SpaceX and Solar City chapters were quite entertaining. The Tesla ones were too abstruse for me. The Paypal one was alright, I managed to get through it bexause it reminded me of the excellent Halt and Catch Fire series at AMC - those ICT innovators could be really dramatic especially in the founding stories and creative claims. All in all, I appreciate the way he managed to reach self-sufficiency in Tesla and SpaceX (if I were an American I'd be thankful for the employment opportunity) where his other competitors have to rely on other countries.. I now wonder when his space internet and submarine cars will be finished. Speaking of submarines, I hope he also does something with the oceans. Like a machine that collects plastic waste that is cheap, could be mass produced everywhere, solar charged, etc etc. Just use the SpaceX rockets to deploy them to the far reaches of the ocean surface. Can you do that, Musk, since you said you want to save the world? I challenge you."

I found it very inspiring and motivational, Elon Musk has the potential to change the world we live in forever. His vision and commitment to make the world a better place through is mind-blowing. Reading this book really helped me push myself past limits and work even harder. It's not hard when your know there's someone like Elon putting everything he's got into his big vision, working 16 hours a day for weeks with no breaks and no holidays. I was especially impressed how he kept his composure to rescue his companies facing multiple bankruptcies and never lost faith in the projects. Highly recommended book if you want to glance into the harsh reality of a man who will stop at nothing to change the world for better and the sacrifices he made along the way to his success."
21,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34195976-marla-munkh-achit,5,"I usually don’t write reviews for books but this time I had to. Elon Musk is arguably one of the best innovators in the Silicon Valley if not the world. Before reading this book, I just thought of him as a rich start-up dude who makes rocket ships and electric cars. I wasn’t wrong about that but this book helped me see all behind the curtains and the struggles he had to overcome to get where he is. When you look at today’s Tesla, you wouldn’t know they were nearly bankrupt in 2008 if it wasn’t for Musk. The author did a good job researching his background. You get a pretty good insight of how this man thinks, works and lives. A must read for everyone who is interested in start-ups, technology, space, innovation or this enigmatic individual. I wouldn’t be surprised if one day mankind colonize Mars because of this man’s visions. "

23,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2506768-tiffany,2,"I'm not sure why the reviews are so universally high across the board for this book. I thought it was poorly written and focused on all the wrong things. Each chapter, particularly those towards the end, was repetitive and paced as though it was a stand-alone article, which made the pacing of the book very choppy. The author focused on the failures of each company but completely glossed over what made each product and each company climb the peak to success. I'm assuming the author didn't understand the engineering and science behind why the Tesla Model S and the SpaceX rocket are so amazing and so couldn't explain them. He goes over the failures in detail, but does not talk about the breakthroughs and advancements in nearly enough depth. I got the sense from the book that Musk is a tyrant (which he likely is), but no sense of why he has inspired so many people to work for him or invest in him. This was a really disappointing book. "

26,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36464297-gorab-jain,4,"4+For something which isn't that difficult, there's this phrase : ""It's not rocket science.""Well.... looks like its going to change. Because with SpaceX, rocket science is not going to be rocket science anymore!The ratings are for the biography and not for the man himself. Because any number of stars couldn't do justice to the epic proportions Musk has already reached and aspires to. This is the most fantastic character I have ever read about... including fiction! Impossible to believe its non-fiction, and even more difficult to digest all this feat accomplished by a single person!Pros: Too many. Impossible to list them. I've become a big fan of Musk and would keep sucking up more info on him.Cons : Didn't feel like a ""biography"" of Musk. Rather a bio of companies he found. Most of the info is coming from close sources rather than the man himself (Because he believes in utilising that time for much more important stuff?). That private touch of biography was missing.Overall: Recommended. Especially for techies."
27,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,4,"Ashlee Vance covers the multiple aspects of Elon Musk’s life and work. Since Musk’s work consumes the better part of his life, most of the text is on his business projects, each of which is a breakthrough for its time.His South African childhood was marked by bullies at school, hints of abuse at home and violence over apartheid in his area. His mother has an interesting background; there not much about his father. Although his grim childhood is referred to as influential in his character, the section is too short for the reader to draw conclusions.Musk’s goal was to go to America. He took a chance on finding an “anchor family” (his mother’s relations whom he did not know) in Canada and from there was able to get to the University of Pennsylvania. There is no info on how he (and his brother) managed the visa system or on their current citizenship status, but Musk appears to be in the US to stay.Vance shines in presenting the engineering and business aspects of Musk’s life and evaluating Musk’s products. He walks the reader through their development, financing and the decisions and management style that brought them about. He writes clearly so that non space-geeks can understand the problems of a rocket’s seals, fuel and its weight, specialty parts and the particulars of launch sites and non-car buffs can appreciate designs that do not need a dash board to muffle engine noise and are wired such that repair via the internet is possible.It is an extraordinary person who can write the code for PayPal, understand the physics of a space launch and raise the price of pre-ordered cars. The experience in losing control of PayPal highly influenced his later decisions for keeping a tight rein of SpaceX and Tesla. His personnel management can be and has been brutal. I’d be interested in the forced turnover data. There has to be a trail of paperwork, perhaps litigation.We can pretty much agree that swallowed up by an industry giant there would not be a rocket that can return from a trip built at ½ the cost of its peers or an electric car with the range, style and safety features of a Tesla. These industry giants would certainly would never tolerate talk of a colonizing Mars (which remains a main goal of SpaceX) in their business plans.Vance gives you an appreciation for Musk as an inventor and entrepreneur. You learn about his hard work and the challenges he faced, but you don’t understand much about Musk. This is just about all of what is presented in Musk’s recent personal life: His brother is with him through Zip2 and then he appears now and then and they vacation together. Musk seems to be in business with his cousins. His mother is a model and at 60+ years has covers on fashion magazines. (Is she living in the US? Is she part of his life?) After he suddenly ended his marriage he married almost the first “woman” (23 years old?) he met. He divorced her and married her again and is now again divorced. (From her quotes in this book and her cameo in “Revenge of the Electric Car”, she doesn’t seem like a committed partner.) He banned stuffed toys for his sons at age 7. The hours he claims to spend with his sons don’t add up.The book is a good presentation of Musk and his empire. Filling in the areas it lacks (childhood, family, personnel management) would make it a much longer book, and may be outside the author’s expertise. There are some photos. An index would have been helpful."
28,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28913298-shalini,5,"Inspirational as hell. Undoubtedly, this book is going on my all-time favourites shelf.“Elon Musk : Inventing the future” is not just a biography of Elon Musk, it’s about everything and everyone important who has build SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity - three of the grand business ventures which would be instrumental in changing the future of humanity.Honestly, I still have no idea whether it's Musk's genes or his childhood existential depression or something else that has shaped him in the genius he is. But I'm convinced the stakes of being Musk are quite high which we are not really ready to take. Those sacrifices, passions, obsessions - are what it takes to be Musk. He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone, stay focused in the midst of a crisis like one in 2008 and to make enormous decisions very quickly. And most important of all, his understanding of the basic laws of physics of rockets gives him an edge. He always says, “Take it down to physics”. He picks up really aggressive time schedule and values highly detailed proposals about how the projects will be accomplished with day-by-day and hour-by-hour forecasts. The idea of work-life balance is just meaningless in his context - to him, it is just work which is life.From Zip2 & X.com (PayPal), Musk set out on his adventure to colonize Mars, in between joined Eberhard of Tesla, Rive of SolarCity, J. B. Straubel, Shotwell, Mary Brown and a great number of bright, ambitious people working with Musk “helping develop these wonderful technologies but in relative obscurity”. And no matter what the critics say, he has proved himself constantly through Model S - an electric car with no compromises which was launched in a market where building electric car was considered the shittest business oppportunity and Falcon 9 - a name which changed the face of private aerospace ventures and bought SpaceX a recognition in the eyes of NASA. Now, Musk wants to automate a great deal of the rocket launch process and fly rockets several times a month. There is a guy who dreams the impossible and just makes it happen.Quite true to his nature Elon initially refused to cooperate with the making of this book, but he did commit to it later on. However, it is evident to the reader that his involvement was quite superficial by the fact that the book shares very few glimpses in the mind & insights of Musk.4 stars because this isn’t the best “possible” biography of Elon Musk. Vance himself accepts, “It felt at times writing a proper book about Musk was impossible.”5 stars because this is the best we can ever get, at least we have till now. Vance has done an amazing job in sketching the genius of Elon Musk."
29,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"Amazing to get a glimpse inside the world of one of the more interesting people alive today. Elon has his faults, but in an era where a lot of entrepreneurs are working on problems that can be described more as ""making money"" and not ""making the world better for humanity"", Elon is uniquely trying to solve some of humanity's biggest problems, and he doesn't care at all about making money. He is mission driven on solving our dependence on oil (Tesla), removing our dependence on this single planet (SpaceX), creating clean energy (Solar City), improving transportation (The Boring Company), and more. These are all problems that desperately need solving, and are hard but not impossible to solve. ""What Musk has developed that so many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley lack is a meaningful worldview. He’s the possessed genius on the grandest quest anyone has ever concocted. He’s less a CEO chasing riches than a general marshaling troops to secure victory. Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to . . . well . . . save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.""And he is sincere in being focused on the mission and not generating profits. For instance, Tesla's mission is to reduce dependence on oil, not build a valuable electric car company. Thus, Elon open sourced all their patents and technology so that other car makers could use it too. Admirable. One of the things that I learned and admired about Elon is that when he gets interested in something he just goes deep on the subject until he knows everything about it. He did this at the start of all the businesses he's started - he went and learned everything there was to know about space and rockets, or about electric cars. This gives him a huge advantage and base of knowledge in starting something because he knows the underlying physics and economics of the space. I like this approach :)""When Elon gets into something, he develops just this different level of interest in it than other people. That is what differentiates Elon from the rest of humanity.""One of these deep dives led him to a fascinating conclusion: that the costs to build a decent rocket should be a lot less than they were. Materials science had evolved a lot over the years, but NASA and rocket makers were not trying to take advantage of that to lower costs. SpaceX could deliver rockets at 1/10th the cost! ""Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made much cheaper than what the Russians were offering. """"Musk felt that the space industry had not really evolved in about fifty years. The aerospace companies had little competition and tended to make supremely expensive products that achieved maximum performance. They were building a Ferrari for every launch, when it was possible that a Honda Accord might do the trick.""Another thing I found fascinating was this:""SpaceX manufactures between 80 percent and 90 percent of its rockets, engines, electronics, and other parts. It’s a strategy that flat-out dumbfounds SpaceX’s competitors, like United Launch Alliance, or ULA, which openly brags about depending on more than 1,200 suppliers to make its end products.""Basically, making your own parts let's you make them cheaper, much faster, AND gives you the ability to innovate on them, which is very hard if others are making them. I am not sure if Elon knew this going in or just drove in this direction because it was most cost effective, but it was very interesting to learn about. And the result has been impressive, after many years of crazy hard sounding ups and downs, it got profitable: ""Since getting past its near-death experience in 2008, SpaceX has been profitable and is estimated to be worth $12 billion."""
30,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,2,"Ok. First of all I'm not a huge fan of biographies, autobiographies yes, but not biographies. They usually feel bias. Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
31,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
32,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

He thought years ahead of his generation, made his crazy ideas materialize by his rigor, earnest work and a very capable work force.Undoubtedly Musk is a highly commendable entrepreneur for all he gave to this world, but the way Ashlee Vance has put it into the words, doesn't do much justice to the book. The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting.

However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "
35,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52663173-e-h-nathasia,5,"My first non-fiction read of 2018 and I am rating it a 5! I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
36,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage.

I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
40,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."
41,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4021000-marla,4,I found this very fascinating. I've always been interested in learning more about Elon Musk as I've watched him over the years with Space X and Tesla. He's a very smart person who needs to keep going with his work. I think he can help to make sure there is a future for the next generation.

43,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5614272-licha,1,"Anyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same head-scratching experience. You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "
44,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14943717-indrani-sen,5,"A very well written biography about a man more spectacular than most known superheroes. Be it in intelligence, leadership, interesting backstory, character flaws, Grecian tragedy - it's all there. A man who will stop at nothing to achieve what he envisions. There have been adversaries and critics galore, but the Musk miracles march on.A very inspiring, enlightening and entertaining read. Very highly recommend."
45,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Musk is a really fascinating man. The author is a bit too enamored by his object to show some of the uglier aspects of the man and his businesses. He doesn't leave them out of the story, but he seems to excuse Musk right after saying that what he did was messed up. Still, I think the press is so down on Musk that it's really useful to get a positive version of a man who will probably be remembered as one of the titans of American business."

48,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoufa-ibrahim,5,"The book is about one of the greatest mind in our time: Elon Musk 
""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "
49,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,5,"“He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!
“Good ideas are always crazy until they’re not.”

50,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27681396-krad,1,"(-) Without a doubt, the reader is much better off reading this highly entertaining and informative 'Wait But Why' article series on Musk than this. Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
51,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."

Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk. At the end of the book I found the discussion about Hyperloop and the California Fast Rail or Rocket train most fascinating. Fred Sanders narrated the book."

We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
54,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
55,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."

Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal.

60,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,2,"Ok. First of all I'm not a huge fan of biographies, autobiographies yes, but not biographies. They usually feel bias. Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
61,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
62,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
66,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage. My quick and simple overall: candor and extremely well done lead to a fascinating read."

69,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Wow this book was huge lol I feel like I know alllllll about Elon now lol Which is a good thing because wow his life is so interesting! I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
70,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."
71,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4021000-marla,4,I found this very fascinating.

73,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5614272-licha,1,"Anyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same head-scratching experience. You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "

Be it in intelligence, leadership, interesting backstory, character flaws, Grecian tragedy - it's all there. A man who will stop at nothing to achieve what he envisions. There have been adversaries and critics galore, but the Musk miracles march on.A very inspiring, enlightening and entertaining read. Very highly recommend."
75,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Musk is a really fascinating man. The author is a bit too enamored by his object to show some of the uglier aspects of the man and his businesses. He doesn't leave them out of the story, but he seems to excuse Musk right after saying that what he did was messed up. Still, I think the press is so down on Musk that it's really useful to get a positive version of a man who will probably be remembered as one of the titans of American business."

78,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoufa-ibrahim,5,"The book is about one of the greatest mind in our time: Elon Musk 
""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "
79,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,5,"“He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!
“Good ideas are always crazy until they’re not.”

80,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27681396-krad,1,"(-) Without a doubt, the reader is much better off reading this highly entertaining and informative 'Wait But Why' article series on Musk than this. Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
81,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."

Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk.

We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
84,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
85,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals.

I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
91,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
92,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

He thought years ahead of his generation, made his crazy ideas materialize by his rigor, earnest work and a very capable work force.Undoubtedly Musk is a highly commendable entrepreneur for all he gave to this world, but the way Ashlee Vance has put it into the words, doesn't do much justice to the book. The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting. Halfway through the book, I had completely lost interest in the book, just finished it for the sake of finishing. "
94,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6110237-andreea,2,"I was really looking forward to reading this book and finding more things about Elon Musk. However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
96,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage. My quick and simple overall: candor and extremely well done lead to a fascinating read."

I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
100,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."

You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "

The author is a bit too enamored by his object to show some of the uglier aspects of the man and his businesses. He doesn't leave them out of the story, but he seems to excuse Musk right after saying that what he did was messed up. Still, I think the press is so down on Musk that it's really useful to get a positive version of a man who will probably be remembered as one of the titans of American business."

108,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoufa-ibrahim,5,"The book is about one of the greatest mind in our time: Elon Musk 
""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "
109,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,5,"“He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!

110,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27681396-krad,1,"(-) Without a doubt, the reader is much better off reading this highly entertaining and informative 'Wait But Why' article series on Musk than this. Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
111,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."

The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"

Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."
118,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4888462-ryan,1,"I can't believe how many good reviews this book has. It's absolutely terrible. The initial chapters are so contrived it's unbelievable, they're one liner interviews from Musk's schoolmates and they say things like 'Musk was sat on the step questioning whether banks would ever be paperless.' Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal. There's pretty much the exact same situation when he meets his first girlfriend - 'The first thing Musk said to me was that he though a lot about electric cars. Come on."
119,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,I expected to get informed much more about Musk's thoughts. Most of the book was about the story of the companies musk started and literally I expected to see much more of Musk's involvement. 
120,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,2,"Ok. First of all I'm not a huge fan of biographies, autobiographies yes, but not biographies. They usually feel bias. Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
121,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
122,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting.

However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
126,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage.

I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
130,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."

You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "

""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "

I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!

Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
141,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."
142,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"I found this to be a most interesting book. I enjoyed getting a look at the inside view of Tesla and Space X. Ashlee Vance examines the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most unpredictable and ambitious entrepreneurs. He covers Elon Musk’s early life in South Africa where he was born right up to 2015Vance is a writer at Bloomberg Business Week and is a well known writer on technology. Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk. At the end of the book I found the discussion about Hyperloop and the California Fast Rail or Rocket train most fascinating. Fred Sanders narrated the book."
143,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23802045-vinit-nayak,5,"Amazing, I'd want him to raise my children. We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
144,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
145,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."
148,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4888462-ryan,1,"I can't believe how many good reviews this book has. It's absolutely terrible. The initial chapters are so contrived it's unbelievable, they're one liner interviews from Musk's schoolmates and they say things like 'Musk was sat on the step questioning whether banks would ever be paperless.' Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal. There's pretty much the exact same situation when he meets his first girlfriend - 'The first thing Musk said to me was that he though a lot about electric cars. Come on."
149,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,I expected to get informed much more about Musk's thoughts. Most of the book was about the story of the companies musk started and literally I expected to see much more of Musk's involvement. 
150,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,2,"Ok. First of all I'm not a huge fan of biographies, autobiographies yes, but not biographies. They usually feel bias. Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
151,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
152,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

He thought years ahead of his generation, made his crazy ideas materialize by his rigor, earnest work and a very capable work force.Undoubtedly Musk is a highly commendable entrepreneur for all he gave to this world, but the way Ashlee Vance has put it into the words, doesn't do much justice to the book. The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting.

However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
156,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage.

I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
160,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."

163,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5614272-licha,1,"Anyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same head-scratching experience. You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "

Be it in intelligence, leadership, interesting backstory, character flaws, Grecian tragedy - it's all there. A man who will stop at nothing to achieve what he envisions. There have been adversaries and critics galore, but the Musk miracles march on.A very inspiring, enlightening and entertaining read. Very highly recommend."
165,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Musk is a really fascinating man. The author is a bit too enamored by his object to show some of the uglier aspects of the man and his businesses. He doesn't leave them out of the story, but he seems to excuse Musk right after saying that what he did was messed up. Still, I think the press is so down on Musk that it's really useful to get a positive version of a man who will probably be remembered as one of the titans of American business."

167,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76664436-daniel-saavedra,5,This is a must read book to understand Elon MuskI really liked this book. It's contemplating the key aspects to understand the present and the future of Tesla and SpaceX.
168,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoufa-ibrahim,5,"The book is about one of the greatest mind in our time: Elon Musk 
""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "
169,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,5,"“He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!
“Good ideas are always crazy until they’re not.”

170,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27681396-krad,1,"(-) Without a doubt, the reader is much better off reading this highly entertaining and informative 'Wait But Why' article series on Musk than this. Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
171,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."

Ashlee Vance examines the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most unpredictable and ambitious entrepreneurs. He covers Elon Musk’s early life in South Africa where he was born right up to 2015Vance is a writer at Bloomberg Business Week and is a well known writer on technology. Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk. At the end of the book I found the discussion about Hyperloop and the California Fast Rail or Rocket train most fascinating. Fred Sanders narrated the book."

We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
174,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
175,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."

The initial chapters are so contrived it's unbelievable, they're one liner interviews from Musk's schoolmates and they say things like 'Musk was sat on the step questioning whether banks would ever be paperless.' Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal. There's pretty much the exact same situation when he meets his first girlfriend - 'The first thing Musk said to me was that he though a lot about electric cars. Come on."
179,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,I expected to get informed much more about Musk's thoughts. Most of the book was about the story of the companies musk started and literally I expected to see much more of Musk's involvement. 
180,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,2,"Ok. First of all I'm not a huge fan of biographies, autobiographies yes, but not biographies. They usually feel bias. Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
181,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
182,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting.

However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"

The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture.

I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
190,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."
191,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4021000-marla,4,I found this very fascinating. I've always been interested in learning more about Elon Musk as I've watched him over the years with Space X and Tesla. He's a very smart person who needs to keep going with his work. I think he can help to make sure there is a future for the next generation.

193,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5614272-licha,1,"Anyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same head-scratching experience. You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "
194,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14943717-indrani-sen,5,"A very well written biography about a man more spectacular than most known superheroes. Be it in intelligence, leadership, interesting backstory, character flaws, Grecian tragedy - it's all there. A man who will stop at nothing to achieve what he envisions. There have been adversaries and critics galore, but the Musk miracles march on.A very inspiring, enlightening and entertaining read. Very highly recommend."
195,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Musk is a really fascinating man. The author is a bit too enamored by his object to show some of the uglier aspects of the man and his businesses. He doesn't leave them out of the story, but he seems to excuse Musk right after saying that what he did was messed up. Still, I think the press is so down on Musk that it's really useful to get a positive version of a man who will probably be remembered as one of the titans of American business."

197,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76664436-daniel-saavedra,5,This is a must read book to understand Elon MuskI really liked this book. It's contemplating the key aspects to understand the present and the future of Tesla and SpaceX.
198,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoufa-ibrahim,5,"The book is about one of the greatest mind in our time: Elon Musk 
""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "
199,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,5,"“He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!
“Good ideas are always crazy until they’re not.”

200,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27681396-krad,1,"(-) Without a doubt, the reader is much better off reading this highly entertaining and informative 'Wait But Why' article series on Musk than this. Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
201,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."
202,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"I found this to be a most interesting book. I enjoyed getting a look at the inside view of Tesla and Space X. Ashlee Vance examines the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most unpredictable and ambitious entrepreneurs. He covers Elon Musk’s early life in South Africa where he was born right up to 2015Vance is a writer at Bloomberg Business Week and is a well known writer on technology. Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk. At the end of the book I found the discussion about Hyperloop and the California Fast Rail or Rocket train most fascinating. Fred Sanders narrated the book."

We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
204,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
205,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."

The initial chapters are so contrived it's unbelievable, they're one liner interviews from Musk's schoolmates and they say things like 'Musk was sat on the step questioning whether banks would ever be paperless.' Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal. There's pretty much the exact same situation when he meets his first girlfriend - 'The first thing Musk said to me was that he though a lot about electric cars. Come on."

210,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,2,"Ok. First of all I'm not a huge fan of biographies, autobiographies yes, but not biographies. They usually feel bias. Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
211,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
212,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting.

However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
216,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage. My quick and simple overall: candor and extremely well done lead to a fascinating read."

He really is The Most Interesting Man in The World.All of the stars! ⭐️🏆🙌🏼(Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster and Starman cruise away from Earth in this final photo from the car after its launch on SpaceX's first Falcon Heavy rocket on Feb. 6, 2018.Credit: SpaceX)"
219,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Wow this book was huge lol I feel like I know alllllll about Elon now lol Which is a good thing because wow his life is so interesting! I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
220,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."
221,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4021000-marla,4,I found this very fascinating. I've always been interested in learning more about Elon Musk as I've watched him over the years with Space X and Tesla. He's a very smart person who needs to keep going with his work. I think he can help to make sure there is a future for the next generation.

223,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5614272-licha,1,"Anyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same head-scratching experience. You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "
224,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14943717-indrani-sen,5,"A very well written biography about a man more spectacular than most known superheroes. Be it in intelligence, leadership, interesting backstory, character flaws, Grecian tragedy - it's all there. A man who will stop at nothing to achieve what he envisions. There have been adversaries and critics galore, but the Musk miracles march on.A very inspiring, enlightening and entertaining read. Very highly recommend."
225,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Musk is a really fascinating man. The author is a bit too enamored by his object to show some of the uglier aspects of the man and his businesses. He doesn't leave them out of the story, but he seems to excuse Musk right after saying that what he did was messed up. Still, I think the press is so down on Musk that it's really useful to get a positive version of a man who will probably be remembered as one of the titans of American business."

228,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoufa-ibrahim,5,"The book is about one of the greatest mind in our time: Elon Musk 
""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "
229,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,5,"“He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!
“Good ideas are always crazy until they’re not.”

230,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27681396-krad,1,"(-) Without a doubt, the reader is much better off reading this highly entertaining and informative 'Wait But Why' article series on Musk than this. Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
231,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."

Ashlee Vance examines the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most unpredictable and ambitious entrepreneurs. He covers Elon Musk’s early life in South Africa where he was born right up to 2015Vance is a writer at Bloomberg Business Week and is a well known writer on technology. Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk. At the end of the book I found the discussion about Hyperloop and the California Fast Rail or Rocket train most fascinating. Fred Sanders narrated the book."

We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
234,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
235,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."

The initial chapters are so contrived it's unbelievable, they're one liner interviews from Musk's schoolmates and they say things like 'Musk was sat on the step questioning whether banks would ever be paperless.' Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal. There's pretty much the exact same situation when he meets his first girlfriend - 'The first thing Musk said to me was that he though a lot about electric cars. Come on."

Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
241,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
242,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

He thought years ahead of his generation, made his crazy ideas materialize by his rigor, earnest work and a very capable work force.Undoubtedly Musk is a highly commendable entrepreneur for all he gave to this world, but the way Ashlee Vance has put it into the words, doesn't do much justice to the book. The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting. Halfway through the book, I had completely lost interest in the book, just finished it for the sake of finishing. "
244,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6110237-andreea,2,"I was really looking forward to reading this book and finding more things about Elon Musk. However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
246,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage. My quick and simple overall: candor and extremely well done lead to a fascinating read."

249,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Wow this book was huge lol I feel like I know alllllll about Elon now lol Which is a good thing because wow his life is so interesting! I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
250,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."

You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "

The author is a bit too enamored by his object to show some of the uglier aspects of the man and his businesses. He doesn't leave them out of the story, but he seems to excuse Musk right after saying that what he did was messed up. Still, I think the press is so down on Musk that it's really useful to get a positive version of a man who will probably be remembered as one of the titans of American business."

258,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14485406-raoufa-ibrahim,5,"The book is about one of the greatest mind in our time: Elon Musk 
""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "
259,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,5,"“He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!

260,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27681396-krad,1,"(-) Without a doubt, the reader is much better off reading this highly entertaining and informative 'Wait But Why' article series on Musk than this. Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."
261,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,5,"What a fascinating read. I finished it in three days but have just been too busy to write anything. As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."

Ashlee Vance examines the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most unpredictable and ambitious entrepreneurs. He covers Elon Musk’s early life in South Africa where he was born right up to 2015Vance is a writer at Bloomberg Business Week and is a well known writer on technology. Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk. At the end of the book I found the discussion about Hyperloop and the California Fast Rail or Rocket train most fascinating. Fred Sanders narrated the book."

We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
264,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
265,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."
268,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4888462-ryan,1,"I can't believe how many good reviews this book has. It's absolutely terrible. The initial chapters are so contrived it's unbelievable, they're one liner interviews from Musk's schoolmates and they say things like 'Musk was sat on the step questioning whether banks would ever be paperless.' Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal. There's pretty much the exact same situation when he meets his first girlfriend - 'The first thing Musk said to me was that he though a lot about electric cars. Come on."
269,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,I expected to get informed much more about Musk's thoughts. Most of the book was about the story of the companies musk started and literally I expected to see much more of Musk's involvement. 
270,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,2,"Ok. First of all I'm not a huge fan of biographies, autobiographies yes, but not biographies. They usually feel bias. Such as this one did.  I'm sure that Musk is eccentric but he often comes across as nuts. Since he has done so much to help mankind, I'd rather not see him as nuts.  I'm sure that the writer does a great job as a reporter, but I'm not keen on an article in novel form. That's what this felt like, a really long magazine article. And don't even get me started on the audio. Avoid it at all costs. The guys voice just drones on. "
271,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This could quite possibly be the best book I've read in 2019. It's shocking for me to say that. It's not necessarily the best-written book, but I found the subject matter absolutely rivetting. The author, to his credit, doesn't get in the way of a good story. He also doesn't pass judgment on the man himself, too, which I found very helpful. Ashlee Vance plays the journalist role very well in this book. It's a role he plays so well that I am immediately going to look at some of his other books to see if there is something worthy to read. The book also shined a light on another problem with my reading list -- I don't read enough biographies. One of my very favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles by Barbara Leaming. I read that massive book twice at the tender age of 19. If I liked that biography so much why didn't I read more? That's something I hope to rectify now. As for Musk the man...well, his story, like many of others of great people, speaks a simple truth: so-called ""great"" people are usually horribly flawed. Steve Jobs was a nightmare of a human being. It seems that Musk is much the same. But, such is often the price of aiming for greatness. And both examples demonstrate that there is no good reason not to go for it. So much of adulthood is ugly compromise that when we see adults reaching for their dreams with the abandon of children on a playground, we look in wonder and envy (and often forgive their many sins).Skin in the game means sometimes you get hurt, and unfortunately, get other people hurt too. But given our fragile existence is there any good reason not to go for our dreams? Not going for your dreams is a kind of death too. ""Adults"" in the pejorative sense often strike me as zombies...the living dead sucking off the life of those who still dream. And the old adage by Richard Branson rings true: If you want a life of swashbuckling adventure, become an entrepreneur. (Honestly, the sheer amount of paperwork involved in starting a company strikes me as anything but swashbuckling -- but replace ""an entrepreneur"" with ""novelist"" and you have the equation right for me). A life of swashbuckling adventure must include ample time for reading too! "
272,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"First step on Mars?Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur operating from Silicon Valley and the man behind PayPal 💰, Tesla 🏎, SpaceX 🚀 and other companies.Musk really seems like the ultimate superhuman when it comes to productivity and is often described as the hypothetical child of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. All of them have very complex personalities, tend to be socially difficult and very hard when it comes to office politics. He seems to have an unbelievable strong vision and peruses his ideals to the fullest extend. In fact he almost bankrupted his companies several times and pushes everything to the edge. He engages in extremely high risk behaviors and bets all of his money on the next step. So far this always worked, but if we think of Theranos, we know how the exact same attitude can go horribly wrong. He reminds me extremely of Jobs and his distortion field, strongly believing in things others think of as delusional but making it happen anyways.When it comes to SpaceX I’m a little torn. Having the random idea to build space rockets as a privat person and than actually making it happen after almost being bankrupt is an insane achievement. Now there actually is the opportunity to reach the space stations independently from Russia and to land on ground instead of crushing into water, which was overdue. But his higher ideal is the Mars colonization, to expand and save the elite of human kind. Of course this would only be accessible for millionaires, so that they could create this alternative universe for themselves. I honestly find this thought a little repulsive and completely out of context to the problems of our time and world. When I think about the current pandemic, disease in general, starvation and similar I simply can’t see the justification to spend millions and billions of dollars into those concepts. It’s a luxury that completely points out the manic urge for self improvement of the rich while the poorer have less and less. He is an extremely interesting character to read about and I always consider it important to learn about how the big investors of our time operate and what they spend their money on, so I can absolutely recommend it!"

He thought years ahead of his generation, made his crazy ideas materialize by his rigor, earnest work and a very capable work force.Undoubtedly Musk is a highly commendable entrepreneur for all he gave to this world, but the way Ashlee Vance has put it into the words, doesn't do much justice to the book. The writing style is that of a Chronicles listing of an event. The content is not much binding and could have been more interesting.

However, I believe I should make a clear distinction between the book and the person. Elon Musk is a very interesting individual: he has a vision and has worked really hard to be in the position where he is now. The book is just a decent read, like a very long magazine article with some photos or a short story. To my defence, this is the first biography I read about one of my contemporaries.What I enjoyed is the fact that the book also acknowledges people that have been working together with Musk for Tesla, SpaceX or SolarCity. I discovered really interesting people like Gwynne Shotwell (president and COO of SpaceX) or JB Straubel (Tesla’s CTO). My favourite part of the book was the one describing the beginnings of SpaceX, when its first engineers were spending days in the dessert to test parts of the Falcon 1. A passionate bunch of engineers were willing to give up their personal lives in order to see their work coming to life. The same thing happened when SpaceX started to use Omelek Island for trying to launch Falcon 1. People just spent months on that island, sleeping in improvised places just to make the launch successful. In the book, nothing wrong is said about Musk and most of his faults are somehow turned into qualities. Probably they would have been considered faults if he had failed. "

I am reviewing this from a different perspective as I will touch on a point he said towards the last two pages from epilogue. I actually have an epiphany; that smart people should procreate and have more children. The 'smart' genes need to be passed down to next generation, and the current trend seems to point that the wealthy, the educated and the secular - all bore a low birth rate. Even smart women began to choose to not have children because they choose to focus career, whereas these smart women are the ones who need to pass down their smart genes to their children for the world to be able to maintain its life through smart people. This theory and outlook is, most would think as outrageous, but to think of it rationally, it's true. Although smart doesn't only passed through genes, through hard work, one can acquire the knowledge and skills required to be considered as smart. And smart has various definitions and areas as well. Oh boy, what a read. I feel a tangible loss after finishing the book. Started reading on the first, and finished it on the 5th day of 2018! What a way to start 2018. #optimism"
276,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Loved Ashley Vance's writing style- a journalist to the core who always provided a neutral portrayal of Musk, with every point backed by facts. The book makes you form a love-hate relationship with Musk. You love him for his craziness, absolute conviction and passion for making ideas that are larger than life come alive. But you hate him for not treating those who were insanely loyal to him with mutual reciprocity (my heart broke when he fired Mary Beth Brown- the Pepper Pots to his Iron Man). But then, similar to the views of Larry Page, one ends up looking past Musk's misgivings when one realizes that he genuinely believes he is doing the very obvious and essential things- improving the life of all humankind by working on solar power, electric cars, and cheaper space travel. Musk is quite an inspiring man with a great vision- turning human beings into interplanetary species. Having read this book, I have gained immense respect and admiration for him. Highly recommend it to those wanting to read more on entrepreneurs."

Elon Musk has fascinated me since I first learned about SpaceX, so I have wanted to read this book for awhile now. I really found that this book took a real candor approach to telling Elon’s story and honestly when describing Elon. That is so appreciated when reading a biography because you don’t want to just hear this great things and acts of the subject of the biography; you want to also hear the bad things also to get the whole story and picture. This was such an awesome book to read. It was well researched and the writing was done tremendously with a lot of depth and coverage.

I knew he was someone special but man I didn't know he was a genius and a scifi geek! :D He grew up reading entire libraries of books, and loved the scifi genre. He read some of my favs like:- The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams- The Foundation series by Isaac AsimovAs well as 3 books I've never read before but now I'm adding to my TBR:- The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein- Culture Series by Ian M. Banks- I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonEven though he's kinda weird socially and most of his employee's didn't get a long with him, he seems like a really fun, funny guy to hang out with, he thinks sooooo outside the box, he's a dreamer that actually executes his dreams fearlessly I love it! That's another thing - most of his employee's hated him because he expects the world from you and you have to work 24/7, don't get much sleep, and don't spend much time eating. He even measured the amount of times employee's would go to the bathroom and for how long they would go for lol And even if you delivered what he wanted in the time frame he wanted (which was near impossible) he was still not satisfied, he just wants more more more. BUT all the employee's say that even though they hated him, they immensely respected him and thought him a genius, and that no one can do it better than Elon.He's gone through so much pain, heartache, and still comes through relentlessly with new ideas. I didn't know that he was such a romantic guy either.He doesn't care about the money (although it's nice to have the fanciest cars in the world) he more so cares about the human races existence. That's how big he thinks. It's his life purpose to take humans into interplanetary existence. He want's us to make a colony up in Mars. There's too much risk all of us living on Earth.I realllllly loved this book, and now I want to go buy a Tesla and fly to Mars. :)"
280,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Elon Musk' by Ashlee Vance is very interesting - primarily because Musk is a fascinating man. Love him or hate him - and millions evidently do on both sides of the 'or' equation - he is a legendary personality the equal of Steve Jobs, with arguably more technological advances credited to him and his companies (Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, Solar City, Space X) than Apple. His miracles of technology occur because he entices the top talent and most recent graduates from colleges and technology companies everywhere. The lure is the quick approval by Musk of R&D proposals to go ahead with testing and manufacturing mock-ups to finished product of some outlandish and impossible engineering invention which would normally require layers and years of approval at other engineering companies. The negative is Musk has no mental monitor on his thoughts or tongue if he hates something - plus, engineers and machinists are expected to work 24/7 without stopping for rest or any other requirements of life, including family. Musk actually asks people to recommend possible future employees who are unmarried and are invention/engineering geeks without any other outside interests.Like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk pushed and continues to push a hundred ideas forward, and some stick to the wall. Result? New technological inventions and in-house manufacturing processes developed by Musk employees have changed the focus of invention and manufacturing everywhere. And Musk does it from sheer guts and personality. He risks his entire fortune almost every time he forces forward a new idea onto a factory floor. Musk literally started from nothing. Since he was a bullied South African kid of twelve writing code for a video game (and published) he has shoved past enormous obstacles pushing him back. His family were amazing adventurers and entrepreneurs and his grandparents and parents also have amazing biographies, but it meant a very rough and survivalist childhood. He took complete charge of his life when he unexpectedly showed up in Canada calling up distant relatives for a place to stay when he was seventeen. The first and only time he fit in anywhere was in Queen's University, and then the University of Pennsylvania, as part of various social circles of fellow computer geeks and engineers. He learned to tone down unacceptable aspects of his character and develop some pleasant social skills when with people.Musk used college contacts and friendships to develop fledging computer and engineering startups, but it has been through sheer hard work and force of personality he is what he is today - CEO and legend of several pioneering technology companies. Musk appears to have a unique and peculiar intelligence, plus he works incredibly hard.Personally, I fear he might end up as an unrecognizable and homeless hot mess, mumbling to himself outside a BART train station, telling people he invented a spaceship which will really take people to Mars while pleading for a handout for food in tattered smelly clothes.After putting this book down, Musk's biography reminds me a lot of Nicola Tesla's reputed life of successes and failures. Wikipedia link to Tesla the man: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_.... Only somehow, Musk gets financial backing to continue again and again - often hours away from declaring bankruptcy. He knows business, financial funding and banking practices/requirements, and has many contacts of both haters and admirers who will work with him. He has a quick intelligence and the memory of a super computer apparently, able to grasp engineering ideas and techniques in a moment of study. He consistently makes ideas of his imagination feel plausible to investors and venture capitalists and employees. Yet, he can be a monster to be around. Ffs, if he EvEr decides to concentrate on developing an affordable and automated flying car, I think he will do it, even if I think people should not buy the first ones or the second versions that come out of his factories. He has the fault of promising results in a few weeks which actually end up taking five years to reach. He will flamboyantly announce success when the product barely functions and is held together by tape and spit and luck to get more financing. If he ran out of money and went bankrupt over developing a flying car, I have absolutely no doubt a company could pick up where Musk stopped and make it work continuing from his ideas though. Timelines and running out of money are Musk's largest roadblocks, not his ideas.Musk is a genuine business and engineering genius who pushes through adversity no matter what. He often does so in spite of his worst qualities as an employer and as a person, and relying solely on his best qualities as an inspiring charismatic dreamer of the impossible with a rational-sounding business plan.Robert Downey Jr. really did tour Musk's facilities and base the Ironman character he plays in movies on Musk.'Elon Musk' is a very fascinating book. What really blows my mind is Musk isn't even fifty years old yet. I suspect he is admired even as he is hated in many private homes and boardrooms. How on Earth do insane-genius people like this always seem to make things happen in spite of themselves?!?! They just do. Even Amazon's Jeff Bezos apparently is helping to increase Musk's legend despite their prickly relationship - I got this book for free as a Prime Read from Amazon.Included are a Notes section and three Appendixes."

You're told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne its home. I'ts a bleak part of Los Angeles County in which groupings of run-down houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck?Excuse me? The author here could not be any more wrong in his description of Hawthorne. I really resent the way he described my city. It is nothing like he describes and really makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book. I hate that anyone reading this will come off with such a bad impression of the city of Hawthorne based on what this author wrote here.And that is part of why I had to DNF this book after the first chapter. Aside from that, something about the author rubbed me the wrong way. He tells Musk that he best let him interview him for this book because he is going to write it regardless of whether Elon approves it or not (he knows Elon personally). So the author wants to make sure the reader knows he can talk to Elon like that, which to me came off as show-offy and bully like. Already I'm shutting down on this book, and this is just the first chapter. However, I think I shouldn't let my initial biases stop me from reading about this fascinating man whose SpaceX is centered in my hometown! Maybe I can disregard how offended I am by this author and just keep reading...Yawn. Snoozefest. I'm skimming through all of chapter one cause it's so boring. It reads like a magazine article, and not an interesting one at that. I only managed to finish the chapter because I had nothing to else to read while I waited to do my taxes...Ooh, chapter 2 seems like it may save the book. It's about to finally start in on Elon's early life. Why does the author only mention the year Elon was born but not the actual full date? And why does this bother me that much? It bothers me enough to finally say forget it and shut this book down.Oh well. Perhaps I'll find a much better book about Elon.DNF @ ch. 2 "

""He's a physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor""
*he is also cute He is not just a billionaire as the title describe him.. he is more than this, I find 'Billionaire' insulting actually!Anyway, the book has 11 chapters:
1,2: Elon's World and Africa:
How he was bullied in school and how his father treated him badly,  but Musk found this stage of his life necessary to be who he is now, it even bothers him that his kid won't suffer like him, their school is so 'protective', as he said.  ""what do I do? create artificial adversity? how do you do that? .. The rule is they have to read more than than they play video games. they also can't play stupid video games""  
3,4: Canada and Elon's First Start-up:
 how he went to Canada in order to get to America and how his earlier life was with his borther Kimbal
5,6,7: PayPal, Mice in space, and All Electric:
 Musk's ideas are starting to form, and his first action was PayPal which was inspired during his intern months in a bank.
8:Pain, Suffereing, and Survival:
 SpaceX was few hours from bankruptcy, he lost his child, and many things that devastated Elon ..the most painful chapter in this book! 
9:Lift off:
 Details about SpaceX and how it gained the trust of the government plus we see in this chapter how Elon recruited his employees, after few interviews he must meet Elon for a few questions
""He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.""
more reasons to why his compaines are succeeding and others aren't! This specific part really made me angry, I mean in our countries, your worth is based on your family, who your father is. Taking the chances from qualified people just because you're the son of Apollo!! it's really disgusting!
10:The Revenge of The Electric Car:
 Telsa, the luxury cars plus helping the environment .. Musk went through alot to make this company succeed! and still it's making progress each day  ""I was joking that even if there's some zombie apocalypse, you'll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Telsa supercharger system""  
11:The Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk:
 SolarCity was founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive then Elon joined and adding his touch to the company it's becoming something .. but because this book was published in 2015 we cannot see much progress in the company since in the last 2 years many things happened. -----Lastly, we see that Elon didn't leave a field .. Space, Cars, Green energy.. Anything that excited him he'll start working on itbut there is no one without flaws, and like Jobs before him, Elon is also a heartless CEO  ""He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals""  maybe that's why there are succeeding! and as Jurvetson(invested in Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, worked for Jobs and knows Gates well) said:  ""I'd say he's nicer than Jobs and a bit refined than Bill Gates""  "

I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” I usually don't read Biographies, when I want to know more about someone´s deeds or life, I just watch a good documentary about he /she. Why? Because it is a Real person that we are talking about, so imagination is no good in this case. Seeing them helps me to understand better.But, this time, I decided to read a Biography. And I do not regret it!It´s amazing how Elon Musk was able to create high tech from basicly nothing. All the sacrificies, the pain, the presure, the failures, the ups and downs, everything is very well described in detail.This book is one of the most Inspirational and informative, I had ever read.Musk is definitely a visionary that is inventing and creating a new and magnificent future for Humankind, whether in space tech, transport or clean energies, he and his briliant team are re-writting a new green way of living. This book is also a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams and aspirations, no matter how hard and impossible it may seems, if we believe it with all our heart and work for it, we eventually make it happend!

Here, expect nothing more than an immature, clickbait-y, over-exaggeration of Musk's laudable accomplishments and struggles - the clearest warning would be the addition of this phrase: ""(..)and revealed here for the first time"", for starters. (-) The consistent immature tone of the book was incredibly off-putting - had slurs and swears that were not necessary, especially if a similar biography could handle Steve Job's occasional crass moments with surprising professionalism and honesty.(-) Towards the last third it was extremely hard for the reader to pin down what time frame Musk's projects happened, and furthermore to develop a connection with his passions. The underpinnings of the style broke down well before then as well; there was numerous moments where the author would mention a truly interesting anecdote offhandedly but never took the time to explain it.(-) For such a visionary of unorthodox series of goals, it felt the author purposely sabotaged the potential interest in Musk and further discussion, and instead, riffed from the company sales pitches and meaningless prices. Readers have other resources dedicated to crunching the numbers if they wish; biographies tend to be picked up to reveal insight of personal life and motivation (of which this had none).(+) If only there were more anecdotes similar to the tale of building the Falcon 1 on the Marshall Islands; there was a gripping tale of engineers having to battle Musk's demands and a punishing jungle island with salty humid air that was anathema to the strict climate control the rocket needed to have during construction. In addition, I found the brief story of Franz von Holzhausen (Tesla Model S's lead industrial designer) fascinating, as it outlined what attracted him to Tesla, the events leading up to him being hired, and ends with an intriguing insight as to how he overcame the various (and numerous) issues with design constraints."

As far as business biographies go, I would put this as one of my favourites. Well-researched and splendidly written, Ashlee Vance gives us a balanced view of the man behind the enigma that is Elon Musk.We see the obsessive drive and determination, the willingness to go all-in, the trials and tribulations and the unshakeable self-certainty that believes success is just around the corner, no matter how bleak the current situation seems. I was especially enthralled by the section on SpaceX's initial rocket test failures and eventual success. After reading that, I found all the Falcon 1 launch videos on YouTube. In the video of the first successful launch (I won't tell after how many tries), you can hear the SpaceX staff cheering in the background at the completion of each phase. Never in my life did I think I would ever shed a tear watching a damn rocket launch video. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business bios. 5 well-deserved stars and thanks to Will Byrnes' excellent review for making me bump this all the way up on my TBR non-fiction list."

Ashlee Vance examines the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most unpredictable and ambitious entrepreneurs. He covers Elon Musk’s early life in South Africa where he was born right up to 2015Vance is a writer at Bloomberg Business Week and is a well known writer on technology. Vance examines the life and goals of Musk from his Tesla Cars, SolarCity, to the success of Space X in delivery supplies to the Space Station. Vance discusses his view of the future including trips to Mars. Vance explores Musk’s personal life as well as the visions he has for his companies. The author also examines how Musk manages his failures and successes.The book is well written and well researched including interviews with Elon Musk. At the end of the book I found the discussion about Hyperloop and the California Fast Rail or Rocket train most fascinating. Fred Sanders narrated the book."

We'll written, in the beginning it does seem to put him in the spotlight a bit too much but Vance makes sure to cover the pros and cons (with still more pros). The most interesting parts were seeing the history of SpaceX and Tesla and what they had to endure to get to where they are today. Musk gets the most amount of respect from me not because he has successful companies or that he is unbelievably hard working and intelligent, but because he cares about humanity as a whole to a level which isn't heard about or seen these days. Happy to see that that is his guiding mission"
294,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12911921-petr,5,"I devoured this book in one go as soon as it was released. It's a biography of my hero, the real-life Iron Man, after all. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity and all his other endeavors are covered in this book in an engaging way. I highly recommend this book."
295,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,1,"I came into this book quite hyped because I think Tesla has transformed the car industry and SpaceX has transformed the launch industry. Apart from this, I think that Musk has done some great things and there's no denying that his legacy will reflect on the things that he's done and tried no matter their ultimate outcome. Now on the book itself...Ashlee Vance set out to write a biography about Elon Musk and I would say, as a novice biography reader, that this is a really bad one. Vance starts the book with how it was made clear from Musk that he didn't want Vance to write it and then an 180 turn when Vance was given full access to the Musk's companies, family, friends to write it in exchange for Musk being allowed to put in footnotes in the book with no tampering. This should probably have alerted me a bit more than it did as the entire biography could be compromised by objectivity.Vance starts the book by describing the Musk family, how his Canadian grandfather was an adventurous person and how they relocated to South Africa. This is followed by how Musk was bullied in school, his somewhat challenged relationship with his father, his early childhood obsessions which is the same as the companies he would found (banking with x.com, electric cars with Tesla, space with SpaceX). After Musk arriving in Canada, I found the book going from biography to hagiography. Sure, the stories of the early days of SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal are exciting and fun to read, but I'm reading this book to understand Musk and Vance makes no attempt to deconstruct Musk at all. Instead, Vance serves up an explanation of how Musk was just born this way and his goals are some he had his entire life. Vance claims to have interviewed more than 180 people but we hear from very few of those, and almost exclusively from people who have positive things to say about Musk. In fact, after covering Musk's childhood, it just reads as company history. A few pages cover his divorce of Justine Musk who he was married to a while and had 5 children with, and who he had a child with who died few weeks after birth (which is also covered in about a page). Vance writes about Musk's first marriage with Talulah Riley in a few pages, but when they divorced and remarried that's only given a single sentence. There's little information about Musk's relationship with his children, his brother Kimbal is mentioned throughout but no details about their relationship either. Controversies are also covered superficially, both with Paypal and the ousting of Musk and Tesla where it was alleged that Musk didn't have much to do with the founding of the company. In fact, Vance puts the controversies in the appendix, not deeming it that important to make it part of the book.Vance has simply decided to strip out anything about Musk the human and instead has tried to elevate him into a superhuman who doesn't feel, who cares about humankind and is going to be our savior.Musk seems to have done some great things, and if you read this book, you'll definitely find out all about the companies that he has been involved in. This is great stuff. But as a biography, Vance has completely failed. I am no smarter on Musk after reading this book than I was before it. Perhaps Vance shouldn't have written this while Musk was still alive, perhaps he was intimidated or blinded by admiration when he was given full access to Musk and his life. Whatever the reason is, I do not recommend this at all. If you already admire Musk, you'll read this anyway and find that it was great as it supported your view about him, but if you really seek to understand Musk, skip this book."

297,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7478358-eric-franklin,4,"A well-done business biography with direct access to Musk that depicts him as a ""force of nature"" maniacally focused on solving acute energy resource problems and making the human species interplanetary. The incredible success of Musk, however, has not come without ongoing personal sacrifice, and the book is not simple hagiography - it touches on the cost of this focus to work relations and personal relations (his marriages and children). What makes Musk unique as a human being, and such a fascinating subject, is the level of pain he is willing absorb in order to achieve his goals. It will be interesting to see a followup in another 30 years or so."
298,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4888462-ryan,1,"I can't believe how many good reviews this book has. It's absolutely terrible. The initial chapters are so contrived it's unbelievable, they're one liner interviews from Musk's schoolmates and they say things like 'Musk was sat on the step questioning whether banks would ever be paperless.' Lo and behold he then goes to co-found PayPal. There's pretty much the exact same situation when he meets his first girlfriend - 'The first thing Musk said to me was that he though a lot about electric cars. Come on."
299,0062301233,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,I expected to get informed much more about Musk's thoughts. Most of the book was about the story of the companies musk started and literally I expected to see much more of Musk's involvement.
