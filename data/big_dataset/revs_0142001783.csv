0,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,4,"""Cutting edge"" in the field of applied neurobiology to psychological-emotional development, and the role of synapses in the brain specifically. There is a bunch of Brain-Based Learning (BBL) in the K-12 classrooms, and not all of it is likely good by way of any grounding in scientific data. Still, the idea of ""teaching to the brain"" has taken hold. I used this as a text when it came co-teaching an advanced Cognition and Learning class with a SPED professor back when I was an ""ED prof"" myself. Joseph Ledoux is quite a character with a synthetic mind and an imaginative descriptor of brain workings, and is also a musician who plays in a NYC band when not teaching at NYU. I also heard him at a conference on the brain and education, and he was fantastic! While enjoyed his work immensely, without some background in basic brain neurology, though, it was difficult for a cohort of mostly principals aiming for superintendency jobs to get through and absorb. One great review of the class said ""Ledoux? LeDon't!"" Loved that."
1,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732395-sarah,4,"In simple terms, this book by neuroscientist LeDoux states that we are who we are because of how our brains are connected. Circuitry is more important than the theory of ""chemical/neurotransmitter balance"" Although LeDoux points to the importance of neurotransmitters in modulating synaptic transmission, he thinks that the overall connectivity of circuits is more important. At least, that's what I got from the book.I have to admit to skimming through some parts that were a little above my head, but much of it is perfectly understandable to laypeople, or people in the medical profession. LeDoux points to the research done so far on the brain, and adds to the historical knowledge his own research. He works mainly on the workings of the brain in the presence of fear and states of anxiety, and his findings are based on this research. I had a little trouble reading about the various ways that scientists discover things about the brain. Much of the research is done through animal studies, and often involves destroying parts of the brain to see what happens. (or many times, through learning and conditioning) Monkey and rat research is used mainly, and if you are anti-animal research, you'll find it hard to read about that aspect of the work. Being a person who has dealt with anxiety and depression, as well as chronic low self-esteem, this book had much that interested me. I knew before this that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and biofeedback worked for me, as well as SSRIs. Now I know why. I also feel a sense of optimism, that I really can change my thinking patterns with some hard work. The brain learns things and it can be hard to unlearn those patterns. But the brilliant thing is that the brain *wants* to learn, so creating new patterns is relatively easy with persistence. This is why I feel that meditation, yoga and overall stress reduction is going to be very important to my overall mental health. Psychology and neuroscience are really trying to accomplish the same thing.Here's just a snippet of the amazing things he talks about it one section. (paraphrased here):There's a two regions of your hippocampus called the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus. The hippocampus is known to help with learning and memory processing. When there are elevated cortisol levels, as in Cushing's disease or in chronic anxiety or depressive states, the cells of the CA3 region actually degenerate and die. The cells in the dentate gyrus normally have high rates of neurogenesis, or growth of new cells (which may be key in the forming of new memories or learning). In the presence of high cortisol, these cells do not regenerate. The brains of people with high cortisol have smaller than average hippocampus regions. With therapy or drugs, these regions typically grow again. LeDoux also points here to the work of Mark Sopolosky, who wrote the book ""Why zebras don't get ulcers"", which is on my reading list.LeDoux points out that we learn explicitly and implicitly, that is consciously and unconsciously. While we may not be able to control the implicit learning, we certainly can have an effect by purposely thinking in certain ways, a la cognitive behavioral therapy. So ""positive thinking"" isn't just some hippie guru panacea, it makes real scientific sense. Awesome!My next book is going to be a book on optimism by Michael J. Fox, because I'd like to read more positive things right now! "
2,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"I'm sometimes told that the popular science books I read don't do an adequate job of relaying the true scientific underbelly of the subject being talked about. That everything is being dumbed down and simplified to reach a wider audience and keep things interesting. While there are certainly elements of truth in that philosophy, I think that's being unfair to many of books that really do a fantastic job of introducing people to these concepts without forcing them to be an expert. I say all that to preface the fact that this is NOT one of those books.Synaptic Self, while almost certianly a simplified version of what Ledoux understands about the field, is not for the lay reader. Ledoux talks about neurons, action potentials, neurotransmitters and neuromodulation, different areas and structures in the brain, synaptic plasticity, etc...and while he describes difficult concepts in detail, and uses drawings when applicable, if you have no familiarity with the brain or the nervous system coming in I can imagine getting less than intended out of this book(or alternatively it might force you to do side research on your own and be an incredibly valuable learning experience). If you've read Pinker's How the Mind Works, imagine a more neuroscientific explanation of much of the material covered in that book. Early on Ledoux makes the following statement: My notion of personality is pretty simple: it's that your ""self,"" the essence of who you are, reflects patterns of interconnectivity between neurons in your brain. Connections between neurons, known as synapses, are the main channels of information flow and storage in the brain. Most of what the brain does is accomplished by synaptic transmission between neurons, and by calling upon the information encoded by past transmission across synapses.The rest of the book proceeds to delve into the mechanics of this. He splits the brain up into three main systems(cognition, emotion, motivation), describing how each of them work and then explaining how they all work together(though he uses these three as a simple distinction, and doesn't argue there are just three physical systems within the brain). But while there is some serious neuroscience content in here, Ledoux does a respectable job of zooming in and out and speaking at whatever level is appropriate to get his point across. Understanding the self is more than just understanding neurons, it's understanding systems of neurons, and understanding how the functioning of those systems translates into behavior, thoughts and emotions. Ledoux integrates both psychology and philosophy into the conversation where applicable, and has a great natural ability to help the reader make sense of the more difficult issues. More than anything though, Ledoux's main point is that many of the historical arguments about nature vs. nurture are all asking the wrong question. It's obvious that both are right, but what is important to remember is that underlying instinct, memory, thought, emotion, learning, behavioral change, etc...are the synaptic connections in the brain, and the synaptic changes that occur throughout life. And that if we want to understand how the brain works and how we become who we are, we need to understand how these connections are formed, and how they can be changed. "
3,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/953731-virginia,2,"I would put this book into the category of ""interesting, but not fun to read."" Why? Because I'm interested in all that cool new neuroscience research, but I really had to force myself through some of this. It is very technical, and although it has the appearance of being accessible to the layperson, it truly is not. I have a little background in brain physiology but still found myself having to reread paragraphs and passages to clarify what LeDoux was talking about. The diagrams didn't seem to help much, either. On the upside of things, the chapters on the emotional brain were a little easier to get through. In the end, I'm not even sure I read the whole book because I ended up skipping around until I found something interesting and understandable. Either I need more neuroscience classes or LeDoux needs to dumb it down to make it accessible to the non-scientists among us."
4,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7976644-david-miller,3,"I'm not afraid to say that parts of this book were very complicated. In some of the middle chapters, all I could really comprehend was that there sure was a lot of advanced chemistry going on between brain cells. Chemistry was never my best subject.But the book's central point is very well presented: everything about ourselves is a consequence of how our brains are put together, and how our brains are put together is a consequence of the genes we start with and the fine details of our environment. This fits with what I have come to believe the nature of the mind and the soul to be, so I took to the thesis heartily. The complexity involved in manifesting that principle in a real human brain, however, is nothing short of dazzling.I particularly found the chapter on mental illnesses to be informative. There's a fashionable backlash these days against the over-medication of America that isn't wholly unjustified. LeDoux admits that drugs which act on large areas of the brain, as today's drugs do, are not able to precisely target the intended brain systems and so cause many unpleasant side effects. But the entire book adds up to a solid defense of the principle that drugs are a legitimate approach to dealing with mental illness. If our memories, attitudes, behaviors, and so on are all tied to synaptic activity, and synaptic activity is electro-chemical in nature, then it stands to reason that chemicals can be used to change the mind in beneficial ways. This book is very logical and scientific, particularly in its acknowledgment that much remains unknown and that many conclusions cannot be applied universally. There are frequent references to ongoing experiments and studies, testing new dogma and exploring long-standing questions. Some of those questions may even be answered by now, but the sheer number of them means that exciting research will no doubt continue for a very long time. It's that sense of excitement as we discover more and more about how we tick that animates the book, even in the midst of dense technical vocabulary."
5,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,4,"A wealth of information about the brain and the way that it communicates. The main focus of the book is the synaptic connections within the brain. The most interesting chapters for me were: ""The Most Unaccountable of Machinery"", ""Building the Brain, ""The Emotional Brain Revisited"", and ""Synaptic Sickness"". I thoroughly enjoyed the description of how the brain is built whilst the baby is developing and further on as it grows into an adult. The beginning chapters were essential in order to get an understanding of the basics of neuroscience. My favorite chapter was the Synaptic Sickness chapter as it deals with psychological problems due to chemical imbalances between synapses beautifully. My only qualms with the book are that it is full of the latest speculation. Many theories are examined fully, and most of them are unproven and have many counter theories vying for supremacy. In conclusion, not much is known about the mysterious space between our neurons deemed synapses, and this book is proof of that lack of knowledge. However, I am grateful for whatever is available to us about the latest developments in this intriguing branch of knowledge and I am much richer in having read this rather than having skipped it. "
6,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9884883-m-a-a-florence,3,"Basically, I was hoping for something a bit lighter. And I was disappointed to read about all the testing on animals. I like reading about science and the brain but this book was difficult to slog through. It got technical quickly with chemicals and pathways given throughout the book. I learned a lot but was very discouraged that neuroscience studies involve conducting research on animals. The author often referenced how one result was found after putting lesions in mice brains or a drug was found after locking up monkeys in cages to make them aggressive and anxious. Reading this led me to learn about U.S. experimentation on chimpanzees, which I find really upsetting. I can't believe our country still hasn't passed legislation to totally ban research on chimps. "
7,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,4,"A wildly educational popular-ISH science book for those somewhere between novice and veteran in the field of neuroscience (basic understanding of psychology and chemistry/biology recommended). LeDoux adeptly and thoroughly covers basics of neuroscience and brain anatomy before exploring both the extremely micro synaptic level and the fairly macro applications to theories of consciousness and self-identity. While he is noticeably stronger in the rigorous scientific aspects of the topic, the broader speculations are still great food for thought. The book is well-written and not overly dense, though I'm hesitant to call it ""popular science"" as it's not exactly simplified either. "
8,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177731-layla,1,"An enormous snooze-fest. My dissertation research is essentially about ""what makes us who we are"" so I was really looking forward to reading this book. LeDoux left whole bodies of research regarding early life experience and how it influences later emotionality and the brain completely untapped. It was more like a textbook with related chapters but nothing that connected it all together into a coherent view-point. Super disappointing. "
9,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,2,"This book introduces the idea that we, meaning our memory, is stored in the strength of our synaptic connections.The author is too verbose to suit me, but that may just reflect my previous readings.Bailed half-way through."
10,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57811430-ronnie-li,4,"I wouldn't say that this is a book to read ""for fun."" LeDoux does not do a fantastic job of bequeathing his knowledge and the frontiers of neuroscience research to the layperson. This book gets pretty technical; for example, when he mentions Hebbian plasticity and AMPA/NMDA receptors, the average person without a decent neuroscience foundation will likely get lost and ponder its significance. Nevertheless, because I majored in neuroscience at my university, I was more than well prepared to read this book. I enjoyed the prose, although it seemed like a long and dense research paper at times. This book was actually assigned as a supplementary textbook for my summer neuroscience course when I was a sophomore in high school; therefore, I knew it wasn't supposed to be read for leisure. With no neuroscience background at the time, I found it extremely challenging and put it off for years until I amassed enough knowledge to read it. I'd highly recommend this to those who want a serious, in-depth look at the field of neuroscience. Although this book is old, the same fundamental principles still apply."
11,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57274939-breyen-hyphen,0,"Hard to get into but that may be because it starts off from the psychology POV before it gets to the real neuroscience, and personally, I find psych a little deadening but I really like neuro. I moved thru it faster after it caught up to relatively present-day research. It presents some interesting revelations and information... this book really made me think. I'd say if the author wants to find a broader audience, the prose could be looser. And this isn't for everyone. It's not graduate level science but there's quite a lot of diagrams and references and abbreviations for specific brain regions, circuits, and geographic areas. So it's not always ""entertaining"" and unless you really study it, you're not going to remember all those details. So sometimes it's too much. But in general if you really want to know more about the brain without going back to school, and are willing to put in the work for a read like this, it's well worth it."
12,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69576845-shubhang-goswami,5,"This book is riveting. I had the absolute pleasure reading this. It does get quite technical. It is like a protein bar, very dense, hard to chew, takes time to digest but is packed with goodness. It has a lot of information for a pop science book and is a great way to get introduced to the field of neuroscience. This book has been brilliant, there is so much I learned from this book. The author provides different views on theories and then gives his own opinion on the controversial theories in question. He does a great job of keeping the discussion as neutral as possible. This book complements The Emotional Brain, written by the same author. Synaptic self is part 2.A very good informative book. Please read."
13,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92711422-mr-monahan,3,"I really wish this book had been assigned as a supplement to my otherwise bone-dry introductory Bio-psychology/neurology course. One review has noted that LeDoux's style is dry, but I have to say it is far more lively than the other Neuroscientist's prose. A great primer or supplement of the pre-medical or psychology student. "
14,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69165942-denis-laesker,5,"This book certainly brings about a lot of insight and information about the brain, mind, and the synapses that make us, well, us. By learning about the underlying mechanisms in which our mind learns and behaves, one can start to understand his, or her, own self. Definitely a re-read after reading some of the supplementary literature. "
15,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7653074-asanka,5,"Deep Learning and its use of artificial neural networks is so mainstream nowadays. Everybody in Computer Science know and use them in one way or another. However, it's funny how little we know about how its biological counterpart - the biological neural network. The fault is on us. We were too much into Mathematics since A/L that we thought Biology is a lesser science. We were mistaken.If you are learning or using artificial neural networks and always wondered how exactly the same things are already implemented in the natural world, here's a good book to read. Things such as 'activation functions' are actually out there and they are entirely built on chemical building blocks. And they work perfectly and far more better than our artificial stuff."
16,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487616-peter-aronson,4,A somewhat difficult but worthwhile book on a fascinating topic.
17,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57751703-stephen,5,"A bit heavy on the neuro Jargon, not for the casual reader. This book got my an A on my NeuroPsych final :-)"
18,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58844718-katie,4,"Really interesting but quite dense, doesn't exactly make for light reading!"
19,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11655268-marcos,3,"It was overall a good book, but it didn't wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be. In my opinion the author suffers from the same problem that most hard core scientists who try to write a pop-science book:an overuse of technical language and the assumption that the reader has the basic knowledge to understand what is being discussed. I'm not implying that the authors do this in a conscious manner, but since they're too immersed in they fields is perfectly normal that (even though they try their best oftentimes) they leave many things out that are essential for the understanding of the subject. This knowledge might even be so embedded in their brains and at the same time be so basic that they don't even ""think"" about it. Only those few who can truly dominate the art and science of pedagogy can get rid of this problem. Fortunately I have a strong background in biological sciences, so even though I had to struggle with the content I was able to get the most of it. The other error that LeDoux commits is that of giving examples that are too specific and getting too deep into each of them. I understand that this is a very (I'd say extremely) complicated subject, but the generalities can be explained relatively easily and with much more interesting and general examples than the ones he used. Besides, his writing style is also awkward: I felt as if I were reading a scientific paper most of the time. Sometimes he uses entire sentences just to mention the names of the researchers and institutions that made so and so research. This is understandable if you're writing an official paper, but not if you're attempting to convey some scientific knowledge to the layperson. Sometimes he uses entire pages guiding you through some specific circuit with all the back and forth that characterizes our messy brains, and it does so with a very technical language. This kind of ""digging"" into the intricateness of neuronal paths is what makes very hard to see the overall picture of how neurons make the self. Much of these examples could have been simplified and enriched with some fascinating stories of mental disturbances. Brain diseases, which besides being very interesting, are perfect examples of how the self is ultimately based on the structure of the brain, but the book falls short of these examples too (only one chapter called Synaptic Sickness is devoted to the subject, but most of it is lost in describing neural pathways and very specific biochemical processes). Conclusion: if you have a background on neurobiology +3/5, if you don't the book is a plain 1/5."
20,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8795422-william,5,"LeDoux has a winner againJoseph LeDoux has written an exciting book that captures the current state of research in neuroscience. He makes life easy for the lay reader by thoroughly covering not only his own research and theory but that of most other points of view both contemporary and historical thus helping to place his work in a context that gives the reader the feeling that he is reading something on the cutting edge. He is so thorough that one almost thinks that he gives a little too much time to the philosophical approach but at least he stays away from burying the reader in qualia.In a nut shell, LeDoux makes his argument that Hebbian plasticity is alive and well and that the mechanism for learning and memory is located at the synapses through the action of the neurotransmitters. You almost feel that, by God, he's got it right. The interaction of different neural loci such as the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex are pictured as creating interconnecting networks that craft our responses to the environment, both external and internal. These are all made coherent by wrapping them in the mental trilogy of cognition, emotion and motivation. My only concern is when he mentions the retrieval of stored information and the comparison of present neural information with previously stored experience. This implies that an agent is lurking about conducting these activities. It's the homunculus rearing his ugly head. He also leaves out the interesting research conducted by Benjamin Libet on the disparity between response and the intention to respond. But these are small matters for there is much to fascinate and inform the reader who is fortunate enough to come across this book.LeDoux also provides an interesting chapter on synaptic sickness. This chapter could stand on it's own though it flows elegantly from the previous theory. It gives a cogent explanation for mental illness and the promising approaches to it's treatment at the level of neurotransmitters and synapses."
21,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18310-mark,5,"LeDoux may be a hard-nosed scientist, but he is a great guide to understanding the brain as an integrated system. Having little previous exposure to neurobiology I found it necessary to take some notes (okay, copious notes) while reading for some things to ""stick"", but it was well worth it. He outlines the ways that brain plasticity functions at the level of individual neurons and synapses, which was really eye-opening. I never considered how this could actually work (just a vague notion of neurons firing and ""plasticity""), but it was great to get a feel for the chemical signaling and gene expression that has to take place, and for which regions of the brain are rather malleable and which are not. I was also really happy with his breakdown of the major brain regions (and their circuits) involved in each of three aspects of self: thinking, emotion, and motivation. The science may have a long way to go, but this was a great early overview of the brain and how it can generate a coherent integrated personality.The book has reached the venerable age of 10 years old now, which is ancient given the pace of neuroscience developments these days, but LeDoux was smart enough to resist making any outlandish predictions so the information still seems quite reliable. I'm looking forward to getting updated on more recent developments, since I found the details on the roles of modulators (dopamine, serotonin, norepinepherine, etc) too vague and confusing to make much sense of... I'm hoping Jaak Panksepp's book will fill in some newer details on this. I would recommend this for anyone who is tired of knowing your brain only as a mysterious black box that we cram stuff into and behavior magically comes out the other side. For anyone who wants to look even further into what is really going on in there, this seems like a great jumping-off point before digging into newer developments in neuroscience."
22,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/347152-graham,4,"Synaptic Self was a perfectly challenging read. A scientific background was all but necessary, however little was needed in the areas of biology, chemistry, or neurology. LeDoux is probably the best technical writer I have come across. The book has definitely armed me with a significantly stronger knowledge of how the brain works, from the level of synapses all the way to higher level regions of the brain. LeDoux does an excellent job of building on layers of structural abstractions as the book progresses, while at the same time periodically reminding the reader about implementation details of lower layers. LeDoux also confirmed my hypothesis that Psychiatry and Neurobiology are actually two solutions to the same problem. He constantly reminds the reader that the mind is actually the electrochemical state of the brain. Changes of state can occur via the blood-brain barrier (drugs, hormones, etc.) or as a result of data received from the sensory organs. Both are manipulating the same state.My only complaint is that the title is a bit of a let down. LeDoux jumps several layers of abstraction in the last chapter. While I was happy with the length of the book, a few more chapters would be necessary to do the title justice. The emergence of consciousness from the higher level regions was obscured with some hand-waving in what seemed like a premature ending. Perhaps neuroscience hasn't quite gotten there yet."
23,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2926986-michael,5,"Joseph LeDoux is an active researcher in the areas of amygdala plasticity, fear conditioning and anatomy. His research demonstrated that the connectivity in the lateral amygdala plays a key role in fear conditioning. In this book the author takes an in-depth look at neuroscience staring from it's humble beginnings of the dualist theories of Descartes mixed in with the empirical work of Cajal and Golgi. From there the book builds-up to present day research on synaptic plasticity both from a behavioural and electrophysiological point-of-view. Each chapter is presented with historical perspectives that will give the scientific points a more ""human"" foundation. Added to this each chapter builds upon the last anatomically and historically so in a short space of time the book builds up the brain, it's anatomy, it's connections, how they all interact (with particular focus on the hippocampus, amygdala, perirhinal cortex and prefrontal cortex)and how this mass of connections creates the individual. Having built-up the ideal functioning brain Joseph LeDoux then presents multiple points where healthy functioning can be interrupted to give rise to disease states. This book provides a concise, well-written overview of the brain from the past to the very present and is an approachable read for anyone with the time."
24,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1200583-vicy,4,"The brain is an absolutely incredible thing... So far, the most interesting (and new, to me) part is the section regarding what neuroscience knows about emotional responses in the brain directly effecting memory, regardless of the consciousness of the stimuli. The brain's ""subconscious"" (read: underlying hard-wired programming) really is running the show... most of the time... like it or not. There's also a cool section about ""love"" by studying pair-bonding in prairie voles, which are one of the very few species of mammals that consider monogamy appropriate social behavior. It's a cool book and LeDoux does a great job extrapolating some interesting and pretty viable ""big picture"" conclusions from a variety of research accomplished by hundreds of scientists over the course of many decades. Reading after reading Bruce Lipton's ""Biology of Belief"" helps one continue LeDoux's productive lines of thinking."
25,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3688618-steve-woods,5,"For me this was an amazing book. It was a hard slog at times as I don't have a background in Biology, science or medicine but it became easier as I became familiar with the language. This book makes the impossible understandable. The whole idea of the complexity of the human mind has always been daunting to me but this book provided me with a very valuable key expressed as simply as it copuld be for the uninitiated. For me its real value lay in its explanation of the formation of the sense of self we all carry and the bearing this information has on my Buddhist practice. It provides substance to the understanding that there is no ""self"" in a way that just seemed to slot that particular teaching in at a very deep level. For me one of the most important books I have ever read because it has particular personal relevance. For the ordinary person like myself it took some getting through but it was well worth the effort"
26,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary,4,This book gives good explanations to the reader who may not be incredibly (or at all) experienced with the brain and how it works. I found the science to be well explained. I do question how much I will retain since much of the language used and names of various regions were new to me and without reinforcement am guessing will be lost.A good book to read if you aren't afraid of delving into areas of science with which you are probably not familiar. I left this book with a greater insight as to how the human brain (and animal brains) works which is what I entered wanting to know.It did take me a while to read. I found myself needing to go slow and reread some paragraphs as the sheer number of new terms could be somewhat overwhelming.
27,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27597176-lorenzo-bean,4,"At times overly technical, even for one with a science background. With that said, explanations are coherent and often accompanied by visual representations. Overall this book did a wonderful job in fundamentally describing the brain from biochemistry to mental processing. Also discussed is how our emotional systems emerge and affect the brain and body, the influence of explicit thinking and its regulation by, or regulation of, our unconscious self, and ultimately how all of this ties together to form our unique and ever-changing personalities. This read will be a delight for anyone interested in taking a deeper look into why we are the way we are."
28,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/816260-kathleen,4,"this book is fantastic. it was esp. useful for me because in it LeDoux demonstrates that social constructivism is not incompatible with scientific accounts of the brain/mind. in fact, he notes, they are compatible in deeply important ways due to the brain's property of plasticity. this book has some sections that were a bit inaccessible to me (as i don't know all the brain regions and what they are responsible for). however, it was clear enough that even without a lot of brain anatomy knowledge i was able (i think) to get the point."
29,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28638071-niklas,4,"Superb writing on a difficult and broad subject. In no-way a ""light-reading"", it takes a lot of focusing to read it. However, this makes the book very scientifically accurate and the ideas and theories - which sometimes are very complex - well explained.I would recommend this for someone who already has some background knowledge in neurosciences and wants to dive a bit deeper and tackle also the philosophical questions.For the complete beginner: take something more practical like Buddha's Brain by Rick Hanson."
30,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410659-mariam,5,"Are we a soul and a body OR are we a product of a set of interconnected neurons in our brain? This book explored the latter idea extensively. The book had an overwhelming amount of information, I literally had to take notes to keep it all in my head. However, the information was very nicely organized and it was recited in a story-telling manner that kept it interesting. It is funny that it takes thousands of humans to study the human brain, and still be a million miles away of understanding how it works!"
31,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,4,"LeDoux is an academic neurobiologist and clearly knows his stuff. His work on the wiring and role of the amygdola lays the basis for his ideas, but this is a strong base. To analyze the way the brain creates consciousness and a self is obviously complex, and presently not explicable. We need to begin with simple systems that we have a hope of mastering, and this book fills the bill for us reductionists."
32,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538873-justin-meseraull,5,"This book is a little more on the scientific side than your average pop psych book, but that is precisely what I liked about it. Rather than examining the role of the brain from the top down, LeDoux gives us a very detailed explanation of how synaptic connections make us who we are from the bottom up and the top down. It's an informative read for anyone interested how the workings of the brain develop and define personality."
33,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"A fascinating account of what we know about the brain now. The research has us on the brink of many new insights into communications, empathy, and humans as a social species. LeDoux is very good at presenting the current state of research and helping the reader thread her way through the conflicting ideas and theories. For some readers, this book will be too heavy on the synapses, but if you're interested in the brain, check out Synaptic Self. "
34,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33722695-keijo,5,Good introduction to neuroscience for somebody from another field of study. It might be considered somewhat more technical than your average popular science book but still not nearly as much so as a textbook on the subject.Another positive aspect of the book is that Ledoux provides more than enough references for the interested reader to dive more deeply into the subject and/or check the presented studies and their results (paywall can be a problem in some cases).
35,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177612-john,4,"LeDoux may be one of the finest and most interesting authors on the workings of the brain and the implications for consciousness of synaptic function.I applaud his open-minded and flexible approach to all the complex workings of mind and brain, and recommend this book highly to anyone who is studying the brain, the mind, or consciousness."
36,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2413543-greg-collver,4,I enjoyed the book. The first chapter and last chapter were best. I liked his detailed explanations of the mechanics of the brain's various subsystems. Some of the reports of historical psychological experiments were boring and it was not clear to me how they helped build to his final point in those sections.
37,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18127475-iva-d,5,"Awesome book!! It presents a great introduction into how the brain works - from the basic mechanics to synaptic transmission, and how our brains are formed from birth, to exploring the complexities of memory, to mental diseases. The explanations in the book are very well written, and do not assume any prior acquaintance with neuroscience concepts. "
38,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801033-john-erik,3,"This was a textbook for ""Science of the Mind"". Did anyone else in that class ever read it? A good primer on the brain from a purely physiological standpoint; like an in-depth manual on how an engine works."
39,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,3,"Interesting walk through the organization + function of brain from synapses up to processing circuits, though a little too much traditional psych discussion and ""emotion-centric"" (due to author's research focus)"
40,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2219785-emily,0,"It doesn't seem like I'll ever finish this book. It's like reading a 300 plus page scientific paper. However, it is interesting, I do want to finish it, and I'm already halfway through. So we'll see what happens."
41,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2360294-siladi,3,Fascinating info but only the last chapter (and bits of pieces here and there in the earlier parts) are really applicable to the title of the book. As much as I love learning the nuts & bolts of how the brain works it wasn't my first goal in reading the book. 
42,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419544-brian,4,"A pretty excellent book. I learned a bunch from this book, but since I am a cognitive and brain sciences major, it wasn't life-changing. That's my only real quibble, and I still strongly recommend reading it"
43,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,5,"A neurobiological overview of the self: cognition, motivation and emotion. For me, this book was the ideal balance between accessibility and substantial technical detail. Prefect for the advanced layman fascinated by neuroscience. "
44,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94082-sueper,5,"As a neuroscience novice, I found this book to be a bit challenging at moments but overall a very very good read. It reads like an exciting story while covering lots of basics and background of the neuroscience of memory and emotion. "
45,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13062175-raymond-schrijver,4,"Tough read. But was encouraged by this professor in philosophy of the mind, who stayed at the same Spanish campsite we were at, to finish it. Learned a lot about neuroscience and their way of research."
46,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13144301-jennifer-wang,2,"Maybe a layman can learn something from this book, but for someone who works in the field, this book is very preachy. It spins magical tales of how the mind works based on a handful of facts. LeDoux's book's as bad as his band."
47,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16202416-emma-phillips,4,Got a lot more interesting after the first few chapters. That may be because everything in the first few chapters was covered in my molecular biology class but LeDoux applying the general principals to synapses making up who you are was very interesting.
48,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32344401-alicia-joy,4,I think this has been one of my favorite layperson neuroscience books simply because the author provides very precise explanations about connectivity and patterns of activity. Explanation for self was lacking though.
49,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/742162-allan,4,Another of the books I've read to get an understanding of how the brain forms us. Dense but good.

52,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648135-loren,0,The book worked well to draw me in but then it became clear to me that he wasn't making any specific argument rather rearranging information on synapses and self that we already know.
53,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1816625-tracy,4,A bit too technical for me but has provided a good background for neuroscience. Will definitely keep as reference.

55,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1990111-carolyn,2,"LeDoux is often referenced in neuroscience literature. This book is already somewhat dated though, considering how much new research has emerged since its publication in 2003. "

59,0142001783,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22876109-leland-william,3,A good popular neuroscience book. LeDoux convincingly argues that synaptic plasticity is the basis of all of the wonderful things that brains can do.
