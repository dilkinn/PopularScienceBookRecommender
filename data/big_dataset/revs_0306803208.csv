0,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,3,"Thoughts on accelerated change, the singularity, neuroscience, evolution, and more from a man who refers to the last decade of the 19th century as ""the nineties"".This book is the forerunner to a line of fantastic (yet, at times, exaggerated) works straddling mathematics, machines, and biology, known as the ""cybernetics"" movement. At times, this book suffers from the same affliction that Akira Kirosawa's films do - they seem cliched and unoriginal to the modern reader/viewer who has grown up in a creative world molded by their influence. Nevertheless, it is certainly worth a look for both its historical importance and Wiener's unique interweaving of disparate scientific fields.Wiener is the first instance I've encountered of a writer adopting contemporary technology as a new framework through which to view the world. (I assume that there were others before him, but I suspect they would have been almost nonexistent before the first Industrial Revolution. New paradigms based on technology require huge technological leaps that occur within a generation for inspiration and I'm not sure there were any before then that qualify.) Today, this baton has been passed to those viewing the world as networks (i.e. Steven Johnson) and information (i.e. Seth Lloyd), but Wiener scooped them all.Employing Claude Shannon's new information theory, Von Neumann's thoughts on computers, Gibbs' statistical physics, and his own keen intellect, Wiener muses on humans as patterns of information in the entropic flow of the universe, human ""transmission"" (teleportation), and even the social issues stemming from it, such as the economic leapfrog played by agile third-world economics and the dangers of a wholesale shift away from menial labor (and the ensuing creation of an entire generation with no place in the world). Actually, his awareness of the ethical issues implicated by the changes he describes are outstanding coming from a lifelong theoretical mathematician.He also employs these paradigms in ways I hadn't seen before such as interpreting science as the decoding of nature's secrets. He describes each species and other entity in their world as adopting its own ""secret codes"" to communicate with allies and befuddle enemies (yes, this was the era when every scientist in America was employed by the US war effort in some fashion and Wiener indeed worked on code-breaking). Evolution then progresses as a constant effort for an entity in the world to maintain the integrity and secrecy of those communications against the continual efforts of competitors to decode them. Its a fascinating way to view evolution (both of biological species and non-living evolutionarily stable situations in our universe), but Wiener is careful to point out that it would be a mistake to view nature as seeking to keep her secrets from man. I'm not sure he gave a satisfactory justification for believing this beyond the fact that the entire endeavor of science presupposes that we are not being lead on a wild-goose chase. (Though honestly, the physics we're exploring know sometimes makes you wonder...) Half the battle of science and engineering is simply knowing that a solution to your problem exists. For instance, if Russian scientists were to announce that they had figured out how to encode humans and safely transmit them through broadband lines, half the physicists and computer scientists in the US would immediately drop their projects and focus on figuring out how to do it themselves. One, because no American likes to be beat by the Russians, but two, and more importantly, because they know a solution exists. The scientific endeavor (like many others I imagine) is inevitably plagued by that tiny voice of doubt inside every researchers head that says, ""This cannot be done."" Wiener's sound advice: ignore it.Wiener's careful consideration of the details of early computers also tipped me off to the technological desensitization that occurs with each passing generation. To Wiener, the computer's great limitation was the time investment needed to design a ""tape"" customized to the user's needs. Computers, he suspected, would spread as far as cottage industry but not down to the consumer level because consumers would never be able to afford to a hire a team of technicians to create a ""tape"" suitable to their needs. He never saw desktops, consumers OSs, commoditized software, and ten-year olds programming in their basements... because he never saw past the tape. The shift from ""hard"" software programs like a tape and those we have today is one that's hard to appreciate if you grew up with C++, STL, and a school full of Dells. Each generation marvels at and analyzes the new; the constant or omnipresent is taken for granted and left unexamined. Wiener analyzes that which to us would not seem worth a second glance.My one criticism is against Wiener's stoicism. For such a revolutionary thinker, he can still be quite stodgy. His extremely disciplined childhood seems to have closed his mind to any view of invention and scientific investigation but that of the careful, ever-progressing technician. He outright condemns the idea of an engineer taking apart and building things ""for fun"" when he could be working toward solving the world's problems. While I agree with his statement that its important to prioritize the ""know-what"" over the ""know-how"" question, engineering ""play"" is essential. One, humans are powerful predicting machines but not that powerful and a bit of leeway can lead to many an accidental discovery. Two, science and engineering is not solely for the purpose of progress. Its also a source of pleasure for those who do it. I suspect Wiener would faint like a Victorian duchess in the presence of pot-smoking, bongo-playing Richard Feynman or Dean Kamen and his technotoy paradise island."
1,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38497-chris-wells,5,"(my review for Amazon)More than fifty years after its initial publication, this book remains as relevant and prophetic as it is brilliant and exhilarating.To start, Wiener explains cybernetics in a way that the intelligent layperson can understand; he discusses how human beings, animals, and machines relate to one another through communication and feedback, thus becoming systems that limit or temporarily reverse the universal tendency toward disorganization (entropy). After establishing this framework, he discusses the implications of cybernetics on society. As he takes cybernetic theory to its logical conclusions--that is, accounting for the communication and feedback between human beings, machines, and the environment as a whole--his insights are shown to be profoundly humane and ultimately very inspiring.This is no ordinary scientific text. There are discussions of Augustinian vs. Manichaean worldviews and their implications; the inevitable spread of dangerous information (such as that resulting in the atomic bomb) despite the strenuous efforts of governments; and the need not to rely on machines--non-human machines as well as ""human machines"" such as bureaucracies and corporations--to do the difficult work that human beings must do to remain ethical, responsible, and free.All in all, this is an outstanding book written in lucid, beautiful prose. The book tells us as much about the systems that make up our world as it does about the brilliance, humility, and humanity of Wiener himself. No summary of this book, in blurb or review format, can possibly do justice to Wiener's achievement."
2,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/238473-ben-peters,4,"A brilliant, wild little book from a polymath of prodigious proportions, it summarizes his seminal and baffling Cybernetics (1948) and extends an early critique of the information society. Written amid postwar froth, Wiener vaults a theory of communication and control meant to help stabilize any agent (quantum, chemical, biological, human, mechanical, social) into a sweeping philosophically informed lattice of ""communal information."" A must read for anyone interested in cold war history, philosophy, and politics of information science, technology, and society. "
3,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21203517-philosovamp,3,This is the kind of book that used to be written when scientists and science writers were philosophically literate. 
4,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929972-dan,3,"Wiener’s discussion relates engineering to a number of issues: game theory, language, biology, consumer economy, social theory, art."
5,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28136999-vi-macdonald,3,"Clearly an incredibly significant text in terms of its influence on how we discuss technology, and especially how we discuss its relationship to society. But, unfortunately, the fact it's incredibly influential does detract from the experience of reading it. Almost every discussion point, all of which must have been stunning revelations in 1950, feel completely obvious to contemporary ears. That's the problem with being on the cutting edge: if you're right in your estimations, then your theses will be totally self-evident to the point of being utterly taken for grated within the next 70 years. Still a good and breezy read and an excellent resource for if you're researching the topic. "
6,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7390635-serdar,4,"The individual technical details have dated a little, hence the docked star -- chess computers now routinely beat human players, for one. I also felt the book hopscotches around a little too much -- there isn't as much of a sense of a through-line with all the arguments, so it feels more like an anthology of essays around a single conceit rather than a work conceived formally end-to-end. But the moral, ethical, and social implications that Wiener outlines in this book have only become more urgent with time."
7,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53615102-ask-franck,4,"Very interesting. Provided a solid next step in my curiosity / obsession with information theory. The simultaneous breadth and depth of subject he is able to speak significantly about is astonishing, if a little chaotic at times. Skipped a few pages toward the end that felt too boring and detailed. Otherwise, some very good parts in there, and his ability to put information theory in perspective is great. It’s nice to hear from a guy who was both extremely mathematical, and at the same time very well-read and able to put things in a human, philosophical and historical perspective. "
8,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,4,"In looking back more than 15 years to when I read this book, I find, as is usually the case, that what persists are general impressions more than specific recollections. Instead of attempting to construct some sort of short essay, I'll present a few comments.The word ""cybernetics"" was coined by Norbert Wiener, in 1947 (to use the year specified by the usually reliable Science Fiction Encyclopedia), as an English adaptation of a Greek word, kubernētēs, meaning pilot, steersman, navigator, controller (depending on your source). The history of that Greek word tells us something about Wiener's purposes, though I don't recall whether he puts it this way. From the Greek, the Latin language derived gubernator, which led to the English word ""governor,"" and that word was applied in the 19th century to a component devised to regulate the speed of a steam engine by means of a feedback loop. The feedback loop is a concept central to Wiener's analysis of automatic communication and control processes in biological and mechanical systems (which may have been the limit of his discussion in his original, 1948 book Cybernetics) and in social systems as well. And there you have something that's central to Wiener's broader view: cybernetics is not applicable solely to technology. His work has influenced many fields, including biology and anthropology (the latter through Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead), and it's one of the regrettable, unintended consequences of his coinage that the popular view of cybernetics is limited almost entirely to compounds beginning in ""cyber-"" and denotes nothing beyond vaguely imagined ""computer stuff""…The coinage ""governator,"" applied to Arnold Schwarzenegger in his role as governor of California, is ironic here. It happens to be an almost-exact lift from the Latin gubernator but was conceived only as a combination of ""governor"" and ""terminator."" In the latter role in James Cameron films, I seem to recall that Arnold had defined his character as a cybernetic organism, and in any case that's what a Terminator is. Thus Wiener's influence is detectable even in ""governator""…Wiener's discussion is very wide-ranging and far-seeing. He discusses entropy, aspects of information theory, the potential for machine learning, the inevitability of increasing man-machine interaction, the likelihood of increasing machine autonomy, and the need for human management of machines toward proper, human ends--lest we end up with machine management of humans…One instance of a detail I do recall: Wiener makes an important point about the development of atomic weapons, which is, I remember thinking, the only important point not explicitly discussed by Richard Rhodes in his magisterial account The Making of the Atomic Bomb. It's this: the entire Manhattan Project was conducted in great secrecy, but as soon as the first two bombs were used and reported on, it was apparent to knowledgeable scientists everywhere that they must have employed atomic energy, and the greatest secret, that it was possible to do such a thing, was thereby revealed, for it had not been known ahead of time by anyone whether it was possible or not. Thus any other nation, or non-state agent for that matter, hoping to possess such a weapon no longer needs to determine whether, but only how, it can be done. This has been taken for granted for a long time now, but Wiener was the first author I know to have publicly made the point, and he made it in 1949…"
9,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31252077-sumanth-srinivasan,4,"There are many things I love about this book, but most of all is the fact that Norbert Wiener, then a professor at MIT, wrote this book in 1950. Despite its existence well before its time, 'The Human Use of Human Beings' stands as a great precursor to both information technology and media theory.Analogies fly back and forth throughout the first half of the book, between human individuals, societal systems and machines. He pulls this off especially well, putting an engineer inside fever dreams of sociology and cognition. In the process of evoking thermodynamics, cybernetics, media and information theory, Wiener introduces a very new kind of vocabulary to understand human behavior - in terms of entropy, feedback systems, taping, encoding, transmission and denoising. He does so with the help of fiction, often from the likes of Kipling and Poe, and sometimes the mythical Augustinian and Machiavellian devils.Starting with a complete lack of surprise at automation by citing humans' basic abilities to perform as cogs, Wiener then uses this vocabulary to comment on the trajectory of industrial revolution, early valuations of information and the use of communication machines in sensory prosthetics - often delving into ideas of secrecy, deception, surveillance and malicious jamming. In 'The Human...', Wiener actively warns about the commodification of information itself, and prophecies the militarization of such an industry, resulting in heavy gate keeping and rhetoric of meaningless invention."
10,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"Very surprised to discover how readable Wiener is. As a pop science book from the 1950s, of course much of it is dated, but that’s what makes it even more interesting! This feels more than an exploration of technology and science’s progress in terms of our relationship with the non-human (automation and computer interface, in this case) – it would have been interesting to put Wiener in a time machine and send him to 2019 – to see how much of his descriptions of some of the issues the scientist (and the layman) would be facing in the coming years rang true. The Human Use of Human Beings really explores how man will be communicating with machine and how that relationship will influence ethics, morals, philosophy, the law, and everyday life. He lost me a bit in some of the later chapters but there was such an immense humanity to the writing – Wiener was concerned about what scientific progress would do to the individual and was writing a way to show the benefits and detriments. As with most American writers post World War 2, an underlying concern about fascism comes through. As we have discovered, the inhumanity of fascism dissipates amongst the ignorant, the scared, and the desperate who will cling on to anything that seems like it will increase their own status, with no empathy or concern with those that will fall on the other side of the wall (for lack of a better metaphor). I really feel much of this comes down to an exploration of a Machiavellian approach to life (and government and business) – Mitch McConnell runs for office not to really change things, but to maintain his parties’ power. His re-election is the end. Harvey Weinstein was a titan in the film industry – winning awards, shepherding some of the most acclaimed and financially successful films of the 90’s and 2000’s. His behavior was not even a well-kept secret but he was allowed to continue his actions because his films were successful, and he was a good donor to the Democratic party. Power and money as an end know no political lines. We need to explore in our country if the end does justify the means – I do not believe it does. And if the financial & economic systems that are supported by the end are threatened by not maintaining the bottom line, so be it. As we see, interpretation is all – there is no objective truth that any individual can ever experience or see. This is where the idea God comes into play!Wiener touches on much in this concise book:“ I am writing this book primarily for Americans in whose environment questions of information will be evaluated according to a standard American criterion: a thing is valuable as a commodity for what it will bring in the open market. This is the official doctrine of an orthodoxy which it is becoming more and more perilous for a resident of the United States to question. It is perhaps worth while to point out that it does not represent a universal basis of human values: that it corresponds neither to the doctrine of the Church, which seeks for the salvation of the human soul, nor to that of Marxism, which values a society for its realization of certain specific ideals of human well-being. The fate of information in the typically American world is to become something which can be bought or sold.”And how! At this point in his life, Wiener was already an elder statesman of the scientific community – being a wunderkind (Harvard PhD at 18!) and having lived through two world wars, he recognized the danger of scientific discovery being coopted by government and financial systems whose aims were power and control. He began his career as our understanding of the world was shifting from the classical laws into the labyrinthine laws of probability, relativity, and quantum mechanics. That shift in perception is mirrored in the current gulf between the pre and post internet generations.The internet is the realization of Wiener’s theories on cybernetics and the interface between man and machine. I’m writing on a computer right now, which is organizing information to be shared with others, who will receive this information via their own machine. His foresight was astounding, and the dated aspects of the book endeared it to me as a historical document. His conclusions about the scientific process in the age of probability - in that science by design does not allow for a dogmatic approach to its results, only as a current answer that will remain until further testing disproves it – are only more timely as the mouthpieces of our government and media corporations distort what science is and turn it into “another religion.” “Inductive logic, the logic of Bacon, is rather something on which we can act than something which we can prove, and to act on it is a supreme assertion of faith. It is in this connection that I must say that Einstein’s dictum concerning the directness of God is itself a statement of faith. Science is a way of life which can only flourish when men are free to have faith. A faith which we follow upon orders imposed from outside is no faith, and a community which puts its dependence upon such a pseudo-faith is ultimately bound to ruin itself because of the paralysis which the lack of a healthily growing science imposes upon it."""
11,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7708305-thomas-resing,4,"I love it when I find a book written so long ago that has so much to say about things that are happening today. Often, we think, ""This is something so new, that the only things written about it are just now being written.""Norbert Wiener was a mathmetician, but also much more than that. He explores automation and messaging topics that are very much relevant today. I rarely, if ever, hear people talk about Cybernetics, a term he coined and at the center of the book. However, it's great to be reminded that the study of messaging and autmation has been going on for longer than we often remember.How can automation be used to help? How can it be used to hurt? By exploring these topics, Wiener inspires the reader to think about old challenges in new ways. I hope more people read this book and think about the implications of automated news feeds and the people who control them, for one thing."
12,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3394688-pete,5,"A fabulous and thoughtful discourse on human feedback systems I admit this is a book I have read multiple times. It is a book I have a strong affinity for. I come back to it every few years. Why? Norbert's views of the future were prescient of our times. He does a fine job of hi-lighting the dangers of a ""machine à gouverner"" and the implications thereof. In essence he describes what can happen if you were able to apply probabilistic control to humans and tie this back to feedback systems. The book is wide ranging in its scope of thought and for that reason and more highly recommended. "
13,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,4,"We are in 1949, Wiener is lecturing us on communication of humans and its machines; the scope is broad: from physics to society. Regarding information, humans are patterns trying to perpetuate themselves fighting nature’s probabilistic tendency to disorder (second law of thermodynamics). How we are doing it? Well, the whole discussion unveils the beginning of the information revolution supported by computers. Hey, just 70 years ago, geniuses like Wiener and Von Neumann weren't sure about machines beating humans on chess!"
14,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49055233-jonathan-spies,5,"This book is incredible. Not only does he foresee much of the technology that has come to pass, but he enumerates many of the ethical questions we have needed and still need to muddle through. There are passages that have become outdated but the foundation for thinking about technology doesn't get any stronger than in this book."
15,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168981-douglas,4,Decided to try this one as I read Possible Minds (another collection of essays compiled by John Brockman.

The interesting part is that these 'systems' could be anything from iPhones to human brains to political regimes - and they can be studied in and compared using the same methodologies. The author, a heavyweight MIT scientist, was at the vanguard of this new field. In this book he manages to convey quite complex ideas in a non-technical way. But beyond the science he also goes meta and explores the effect his way of thinking has on the understanding of science itself as well as its potentially harmful approach should it be misused at the political/industrial level. Weiner's incisive ethical critique is refreshing especially when it is considered he was a leading US scientist essentially speaking out against McCarthyism. There's a lot repeated from 'Cybernetics' (by the same author) - which is a book that outlines the same ideas but in much more technical language. There's no need to read both, if you're not scared off by lengthly pages of calculus then read Cybernetics and otherwise read The Human Use of Human Beings. But definitely read one of them. Advances in machine learning and the apparent collapse of the political dogmas established around the time this book was written add further spice. On the latter point I would suggest that 'All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace' by Adam Curtis would be an excellent companion piece as it shows the rise and fall of Cybernetic theory in mainstream politics and economics in the intervening years since this book was published. ps. if you're having trouble getting your head around the theory of information entropy (Shannon's law) then I would recommend watching episode 2 of 'Art of the Problem' on YouTube - which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list..."

Most interesting were the worried thoughts on automation-driven unemployment, but maybe that is just because I just read Boom Bust Exodus.Highly recommended for those who enjoy reading this sort of mid-century pop science and don't mind the everpresent worry of nuclear annihilation that seems to come with it."
39,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/815937-eileen,5,"An important read anyone wanting to understand the relationship between ""noise"" and feedback in the communication process. Totally agree with Chis´s review, way back in the 50´s Wiener explained, in easy to understand language, fundamental communication processes."
40,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784493-j-a,3,"An interesting book that dealt mostly with humanitarianism issues and the use of technology. Covered a lot of things between communications, self-teaching/detecting systems, to the role of scientists and the downfall of (in his day) current scholastic direction."

When Faust asked Mephistopheles what he was, Mephistopheles replied, 'A part of that force which always seeks evil and always does good."" [page 35]"
42,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38530310-tony-poerio,5,"Wiener's foundational text on the discipline of cybernetics. Fascinating, and a relatively quick read given the subject matter.It's been awhile, but I remember the writing being quite lucid.Worth the read for anyone interested. "
43,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46422-tk-keanini,5,Wiener is one of the greatest thinkers. This book addresses the social dimensions. 
44,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,It is way less about cyborgs than I wanted it to be.
45,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1208012-matthew,5,80% of people who read should read this book.
46,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1644127-alan,0,"I am using this text in a class that I am teaching. So far, it has been good to go back and read it again by installment. I'll add to this post after class in a few weeks."
47,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4780400-ismail-n,3,Dry and hard to follow.
48,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,3,"The parts that aren't incredibly dated are intriguing, and there's lots of food for thought. Worth picking up if you're interested in sci-fi &c."
49,0306803208,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5905580-lysergius,3,"I must confess it was ""The Human Use of Human beings"" that caught my attention. Alas Wiener spends little time on the social aspects of cybernetics."
