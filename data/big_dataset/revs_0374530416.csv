0,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575909-aram,3,"(I finished this book a few months ago, so it's not totally fresh in my mind. But I see it on Ilya's to-read list, so thought I should warn him before it's too late.)I'm very mixed about this book. It discusses the application of statistical physics and computer simulations to problems of social science, like traffic jams, segregation, economic behavior, etc. The book stays close to the academic research, and so reads less like a management book than, say The Tipping Point.Its strengths are the strengths of the underlying research. Social sciences don't always model interactions quite right and physics and agent-based computer simulations sometimes have useful things to say. A lot of social science seems stuck with mean-field models (the physics approximation in which one atom responds to the average magnetic field of all the other atoms in the sample, as opposed to a more realistic model where neighbors are more strongly coupled than distant atoms) and incorporating network effects is an important new development.But the research also has weaknesses and the biggest flaw of the book is the credulous approach it takes towards the research it covers. Let's say there's some simulation based on a toy model that reproduces behavior reminiscent of the business cycle, or whatever. Yes, that's interesting, but it doesn't mean we now know how the business cycle works! Similarly with power laws. At first people were really excited about them (and this book echoes some of that excitement when it talks about 'self-organized criticality' and 'small-world networks' and other stuff I've forgotten), but as the new theory found itself, like string theory, unable to generate useful predictions, skepticism grew. Here is a negative but optimistic recent editorial in the journal Internet Mathematics that gives some perspective.And so I think the weaknesses of the research become the weaknesses of the book. This is especially since the weakness of a line of research is often the most interesting place to investigate, either so the problem can be fixed or so we can decide to abandon the line of research. The book would have done well to ask social scientists who are critical of econophysics to comment, and then to ask the physicists to reply. Instead, it doesn't mention the fact that a lot of this physics-based social science work is pretty marginal, and that it's ignored not only because economists don't know physics. For an example of what a debate about model validity looks like within economics, see the papers by Rodrik and Banerjee from this recent conference.Anyway, to sum up, this book did a good job of making me think. Unfortunately, many of the thoughts were hostile."

Ball follows one idea throughout all of these subjects: can physical laws be translated into social laws. He also wants to know if is it worth our while not just to formulate them but to draw not only practical but also ethical decisions from the information we gain.He first reduces free will to the most basic set of variables and turns humans into automata and shows us how individual actions can be generalized to an amazing degree. After which he shows us how the same principals can be used to show us how undesirable society could be. And builds us back up into free thinking humans with the task of making decisions for ourselves.Not only is the book thrilling from an all-round aspect of understanding - broadening horizons and making you think. It shows even lets you get into a feeling of excitement and adventure by first showing the advancements of a theory and its promises, then continuing to show how these are really only short-sighted observations and how much further you need to go to obtain an even greater degree of understanding.this has to be one of the better popular science books that I have read in a couple of years. Absolutely fantastic... I even gave myself extra time just to savor it. "
2,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,3,"‘Critical Mass’ is another non-fiction book that I’ve been meaning to read for about a decade. In fact, I read the chapter on traffic behaviour in 2012 to see if it would be relevant to my PhD. It wasn't, not directly at least. Having finally read the whole thing, I think I'd have gained more from the experience in 2009. As it was, I found it rather odd and intermittently frustrating. The central thesis is broad and elastic in the extreme. Ball begins with a potted history of Western political philosophy, then leaps into physics under the broad umbrella of complexity theories. A central idea that repeatedly occurs is that of phase transition: how these occur in substances in water and also, seemingly, in human contexts like road traffic. Ball draws parallels between physical science and social science in a variety of contexts, bringing in a range of theories and methodologies that I’ve comes across or used in the past decade. In some sections he makes very sensible points; in others the content has dated considerably in the 15 years since publication; in others the analysis is reductive. Nonetheless, I found the whole thing readable enough and it does mention a great many topics that interest me: snowflake formation! Economic theory! Traffic behaviour! Utopian literature! Even the French Revolution gets name-checked, albeit in a simplistic fashion that got on my nerves (...it wasn't 'Robespierre's Terror'). On the other hand, in 2004 Ball called out derivatives as wrongly priced and high-risk due to misunderstanding of market fluctuations, which do not follow a Gaussian distribution. So kudos on predicting the financial crisis, there.I struggled to understand the overall purpose of the book, as it covered so much ground and intersected with such a range of disciplines. Complexity is not, in itself, a specific topic. There is undoubtedly interesting material, however the whole reads now as trying to be a bit ahead of its time. Searching for physical laws in behavioural data is a mainstream idea with the advent of big data, however that data is controlled by the big tech companies and therefore largely inaccessible to researchers. Where it is used to understand behaviour by the firms that control it, the aim is profit maximisation rather than identification of behavioural laws. To generalise, machine learning with big data is a black box filled with layers of correlations. It can be used to make predictions about behaviour, but not to explain why behaviour occurs. And as Ball comments, making predictions about future fluctuations in a market then acting upon them changes the dynamic of the market, requiring further predictions to be made, etc. Oil markets are a classic example here. Fluctuations in the current price of oil occur in part due to changing expectations about the future price of oil. As he puts it, ‘The act of predicting the future (if it is taken at all seriously) is likely to change it’. Ball certainly provides a good critique of oversimplified neoclassical economic models and Homo Economicus in chapter 9. He also explains power laws neatly in Chapter 10, which was helpful as I teach students about the 80:20 Pareto Rule in business contexts. On the other hand, chapter 14 is titled ‘The Colonisation of Culture’ yet discusses models of cultural spread that are completely ahistorical and ignore colonialism completely. Such models seem not just pointless but insulting. The assumption that a culture adopts a feature of an adjacent culture based on its similarity is a ridiculous way to look at history. In the 18th and 19th centuries, I don’t think Africa, Asia, and Oceania chose to adopt European features because of their similarity to existing cultures! Pretty sure they were aggressively conquered, their indigenous cultures suppressed, and their resources stolen. Models that assume social and cultural change always occurs ‘from the bottom up’ through the interaction of agents in grids do not seem remotely aligned with observable reality, any more than neoclassical economic models that treat technological and environmental change as exogenous (external to the economy). I remain to be convinced of the merits of agent-based modelling more generally, although I have colleagues working on it. While a complex nonlinear system can certainly emerge from a simple rules-based setup, I agree with Ball’s caveat that, ‘Some social scientists remain uneasy, suspecting that any particular agent-based model of a social phenomenon risks coming to conclusions that depend on the underlying assumptions. [...] Such models can hardly be expected to provide a sound basis for policy until we can distinguish what is contingent from what is robust.’ The current approach is to throw in as much data as possible, which can create further problems of data-cleaning, bias, and inaccurate measurement.Another minor point that got up my nose concerned the tragedy of the commons. This concept is often stretched to infer that human being cannot manage natural resources communally without destroying them. This is obviously not the case, as in pre-capitalist times, and under capitalism in some places, doing do was and still is essential to survival. Equating common grazing land in Medieval Europe with 21st century overfishing is nonsensical. The difference is a powerful profit motive, which is not the immutable natural law that economists say it is. Managing land did not always mean exhausting it for short-term gain and the phrase 'tragedy of the commons' needs to be used with more specificity. George Monbiot has much more to say on this topic in Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics in the Age of Crisis. The chapters on the internet and social network analysis read in 2019 as endearingly dated. Apparently, ‘it was estimated at the end of 2002 that there were around 3 billion documents then available on the WWW’. Bless. It’s quite impressive that Ball manages to explain the principles of social network analysis (which I’ve come across because a PhD student I supervise is using it) without having social media to reference. Nowadays anyone can get a developer account on twitter, download a huge file of tweets, and use R or similar software to map the network their interconnections represent. At least they could last time I checked. So chapter 16 introduces the theory well, but the application is sadly out of date. I expect there’s plenty of more recent research comparing social media user networks with yeast metabolic networks. Presumably the increasing algorithmic meddling in social media feeds to encourage ‘engagement’ has a measurable impact on this, possibly even changing the nature of such networks. (Thankfully twitter can still be forced to stop this by selecting ‘Latest Tweets’.)More intriguing was the application of game theory principles to the trenches of the First World War, although I’m wary of simplistic applications of game theory principles. This is nonetheless an interesting point:So the choice was simple. Either you fought each other constantly, bombarding the enemy trenches with artillery fire and deploying snipers to pick off anyone foolish enough to put their head above the parapet - while enduring the same treatment from the other side. Or you held fire on the tacit understanding that the enemy would do the same - and meanwhile you hoped to be relieved from the front before the next push came. In the one case you endured fear of sudden death at any moment; in the other you had a quiet life and some hope of going home at the end of it. [...] The fighting was, in other words, conducted on a tit-for-tat basis. Such exchanges are a lethal form of communication: they say, “We will do as we are done by.” This is at the same time both a threat and an olive branch, for it also implies that non-aggression will be greeted with the same.The striking thing here is how unusual this situation is in history. The Western European battlelines of WWI hardly moved for years; both sides had very similar weapons and tactics; neither side was fighting in defense of a specific location, for ideology, or for survival. It was thus an even more pointless war than most, which might be what makes it more amenable to interpretation through game theory. Chapters like this are interesting in isolation, however I remain doubtful of how well the whole book hangs together. If written 5 to 10 years later and infused with use of big data, it would be a lot more cohesive. However I do greatly respect Ball’s distrust of the deterministic social engineering that some of his examples could easily lead to:The notion that we could ever construct a scientific ‘utopia theory’ is, then, doomed to absurdity. Certainly, a ‘physics of society’ can provide nothing of the sort. One does not build an ideal world from scientifically based traffic planning, market analysis, criminology, network design, game theory, and the gamut of other ideas discussed in this book.Tell that to ‘smart city’ advocates. Remaining skeptical and ambivalent about the social implications of the material he presents is the only sensible choice, but one that then calls the structure of the book into question. Had ‘Critical Mass’ claimed the route to utopia is the application of physical laws to social problems, I would have rejected it out of hand. The book is more subtle than that, which makes it worth reading but does not prevent various flaws. Of the theories and examples Ball presents, though, some are manifestly more credible and useful than others. His initial discussion of the Enlightenment is thoughtful, albeit not original. The explanations of concepts from physics and maths are consistently clear and readable. I’d be wary of recommending it, as certain parts have aged badly and the whole is less relevant 15 years later. I also don’t think it needed to be quite so long."
3,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3692137-xing-chen,4,"Critical Mass brings together a collection of interesting studies on social statistics, and places them in the context of economic and political history. Naturally, the examples picked for the book are ones which apply broadly to a range of phenomena, and are fairly pared-down, made accessible to the non-specialist reader. I was impressed at how well these case studies were integrated into the text, and liked that he pointed out their limitations and underlying assumptions, and overall simplicity. However, not being familiar with much of the original literature or the extent to which widely-cited theories have been elaborated on to date, I found myself constantly asking, ‘what results would the data yield if one analysed an additional aspect, or added another level of complexity, or tried an alternative strategy..?’ The book is richly sourced and acts as an excellent starting point for beginners.What I particularly enjoyed was the way principles in physics (thermodynamics, magnetism) were linked to social phenomena that depend on the nature of interactions between a large number of people, in ways I’d never considered. Certain concepts were already familiar- emergence and development of traffic jams, characteristics of small world networks, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, Tit for Tat. The details about how laws of thermodynamics can be applied to human society were revelations.Also extremely enjoyed his inclusion of political history and philosophy (areas that I’ve only learnt about in a piecemeal fashion, rather unsystematically). He introduces ideas from Hobbes, Condorcet, Quetelet, Adam Smith, among many others. He describes the work of physicists in fields such as probability, statistics, particle motion (Poisson, Gauss, Maxwell).I think this quote from the book sums up its content nicely- Ball is commenting on the scope of ‘classical’ thermodynamics: ‘it seeks to account for change, but it can’t actually say anything about the process of change itself. It can only provide prescriptions for the start and end points, and falls silent on the question of what happens in between.’ It is these in-between connections that Critical Mass sketches out.Notes:Quote from Kant’s essay, Idea of a universal history from a cosmopolitan point of view’:'Individual men, and even whole nations, little think, while they are pursuing their own purposes…that they are advancing under the guidance of a purpose of nature which is unknown to them.'As heat is applied to a magnet, the orderly alignment of magnetic spins is disrupted, and magnetic fields of individual atoms cancel each other out on average, making the piece of metal non-magnetic. The temperature at which this occurs (the Curie point) is sharp and well-defined, but the magnet does not switch abruptly from being a strong magnet to being non-magnetic. Instead, its strength (its ‘magnetization’) falls steadily towards zero as the Curie point is approached. This is a genuine phase transition, but one that is different from evaporation, condensation, melting or freezing. Phase transitions that happen as a system passes through a critical point are called critical phase (or ‘second-order’) phase transitions, while ones that involve sudden jumps in a property of the system, such as density, are called first-order phase transitions. The electrical resistance of various metals does not decline smoothly as the temperature approaches absolute zero. Instead it drops abruptly to zero. The metal becomes a superconductor, able to carry a current that is totally unimpeded by electrical resistance. The change to a superconducting state has all the characteristics of a critical phase transition: the resistance plunges swiftly to zero as the superconducting transition temperature is approached, just as the magnetization of iron dips to zero close to its Curie point. If liquid helium is cooled even further below its boiling point, at a little over 2 degrees above absolute zero it develops extremely bizarre properties. It loses all viscosity, and once it begins to flow it never stops. This form of liquid helium will even crawl up the side and out of a container. It becomes a so-called superfluid.‘Universality’- the concept that for some processes in the world, the details do not matter. Two wholly different kinds of systems can display the same pattern of behaviour. Phase transitions, for example, appear to be generic phenomena- they happen in the same way for a wide range of apparently different systems.Metastable states can exist if a system is prepared in the right way, but they are constantly at risk of collapsing into the more stable state. The point at which the metastable state transitions from being possible to impossible is known as the spinodal point. "
4,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249180-eric-rautenbach,2,"Philip Ball, in Critical Mass, explores the possibility of systems always following specific patterns, even to the point where an outcome can be accurately predicted. Such hypotheses can be adequately proven in mathematical models or in chemical reaction up to the point where it becomes an accepted theorem or fact. In this case I found that Philip Ball fails to present sufficient evidence to bring his ideas any further than just being unproven hypotheses.The message I got from this book is that there is a possibility that human behaviour can be predicted collectively, in the same way that gasses can be predicted to react in specific ways under specific conditions. This is a fascinating idea, but to use modelling to predict financial markets, war outcomes and voting outcomes has never been done successfully and most of the studies and examples Philip Ball uses actually highlights this very idea of unpredictability of human behaviour.There are some interesting historical studies and experiments in social science in the book which I found was worthwhile to read about. The points he try to make that human behaviour en-masse can become as predictable as phase transformations in material science, or variability in statistical process control, however, I did not find as convincing. There might be some truth in the idea that collective human behaviour in a psychological sense is predictable, or even in a sociological way, but to try to convince that human behaviour can be pinned down to a mere mathematical model is to try to force that glass slipper on the ugly stepsister’s foot. "
5,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is about applying the methods of physics and mathematics to sociology. There are no equations in this book, and it is easy to follow--but the discussion is unnecessarily verbose as a result. Some equations could have kept the discussion more concise, and perhaps easier to understand, also.The book introduces some of the concepts of statistical thermodynamics and phase transitions. The most interesting aspect of this book is the analogies between many-particle interactions and the ""tipping points"" that occur in human affairs. Whereas Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point contains many interesting examples of tipping points, this book by Philip Ball helps to explain better why they happen. He shows that whereas random phenomena often take on a Gaussian distribution, many-particle interactions take on a power law distribution. He applies these concepts to a wide array of interesting social phenomena, including crowds leaving a room, city expansion and segregation, traffic flow, the stock market, the growth and shrinking of companies, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and politics and voting. The book begins and ends with multiple chapters about political philosophy. Maybe a single chapter would have been desirable, but I thought it was way too much, especially considering that the main theme of the books was about applying quantitative methods to sociology."

So far it has allowed me to gain a grip on how things can be predetermined on the one hand (the predictability of mass behavior), yet allow for unique and creative individuality within those bounds (free will). True, it is not your fast read ""Romance Novel"" with a luscious, enticing bare chested Fabian on the front - but there are some really great ideas made readable to a lay person interested in science's attempts at mapping and understanding human behavior."

(Which physics follows hundreds of years of stupid and/or inhumane theories claiming the name ""social physics""). A love letter to statistical mechanics:
Most people who have encountered thermodynamics blanch at its mention, because it is an awesomely tedious discipline both to learn theoretically and to investigate experimentally. This is a shame, because it is also one of the most astonishing theories in science. Think of it: here is a field of study initiated to help nineteenth-century engineers make better engines, and it turns out to produce some of the grandest and most fundamental statements about the way the entire universe works. Thermodynamics is the science of change, and without change there is nothing to be said...Tools, methods and ideas developed to understand how the blind material fabric of the universe behaves are finding application in arenas for which they were never designed, and for which they might at first glance appear ridiculously inappropriate. Physics is finding its place in a science of society.
Introduces a hundred topics from thermodynamics, economics, econophysics, game theory, and fields which don't have a name yet, including intuitive explanations of fearsome concepts like:   self-organized criticality  the 2D and 3D Ising model  diffusion-limited aggregation in bacteria and cities  Lévy-stability  the business cycle  random walks  superfluidity and supercooling phase transitions  bifurcation theory  traffic flow  Zipf's law  the Small world phenomenon  catastrophe theory ...  Unlike shiny TED-style nonfiction, he refers directly to the original scientific papers and includes small interviews with the original researchers. No equations, but beautiful diagrams relating micro with macro, too: snowflakes to traffic and bacterial colonies to cities.The book's reception, in the main by middlebrow, mathematically illiterate reviewers shocked me a bit: their banner conclusions were ""boo! people aren't particles!!"", a truism which Ball spends much of the book thinking about, and ""aaar horrible people have said they've found the laws of society before!!"", a truism the first fifth of the book is a history of. In their haste to protect ordinary human difference from averages, and the notion of free will from technical explanations, they flee to safe refuges like ""complexity"" and ""reflexivity"", i.e. out of science. Ball can speak for himself though:The notion that we could ever construct a scientific ""utopia theory"" [e.g. classical Marxism] is, then, doomed to absurdity. Certainly, a ""physics of society"" can provide nothing of the sort. One does not build an ideal world from scientifically based traffic planning, market analysis, criminology, network design, game theory, and the gamut of other ideas discussed in this book. Concepts and models drawn from physics are almost certainly going to find their way into other areas of social science, but they are not going to provide a comprehensive theory of society, nor are they going to make traditional sociology, economics, or political science redundant. The skill lies in deciding where a mechanistic, quantitative model is appropriate for describing human behavior, and where it is likely to produce nothing but a grotesque caricature. This is a skill that is still being acquired, and it is likely that there will be embarrassments along the way. But properly and judiciously applied, physical science can furnish some valuable tools in areas such as social, economic, and civic planning, and in international negotiation and legislation. It may help us to avoid bad decisions; if we are lucky, it will give us some foresight. If there are emergent laws of traffic, of pedestrian motions, of network topologies, of urban growth, we need to know them in order to plan effectively. Once we acknowledge the universality displayed in the physical world, it should come as no surprise that the world of human social affairs is not necessarily a tabula rasa, open to all options.Society is complex but that does not place it beyond our ken. As we have seen, complexity of form and organization can arise from simple underlying principles if they are followed simultaneously by a great many individuals.There is a real question about how deep into human behaviour the statistical approach can go. Econophysics, as a term and as a living, funded academic subfield, fizzled out shortly after this book was published. Apparently the SOC results have come in for a lot of criticism, though mostly of their overreach than the method being humanistically inapplicable or whatevs.Even so, I wish I had read this 5 years ago: it would have saved me lots of contortions. it taught me a huge amount anyway. (e.g. the huge moral panic, following the invention of descriptive statistics, about ever using means to describe any human characteristics, since the remarkable stability of e.g. the C17th London crime rate across decades seemed to speak of divine or diabolical insurance.) One of my top 5 books on economics, one of my top 5 books on physics.In one sentence: Social physics had at last begun to make exciting progress on understanding mass human behaviour."

It wasn’t curious. It wasn’t interesting. It was a hard slog. I might have been turned off and slightly roused in the suspicions department by the recommendation from Bill Bryson on the front cover.

On top of that he tries to carry out some of the learnings from science into social sciences and leave us with more open questions. It never answers fully why one thing leads to another in society but I don’t think that was the intention. It does leave us with a bunch of things to think about on how we are influenced by one another. Even though it took me time to get through it all it was with the investment.

As I've expected all the details about power law and state transitions already started to vanish. However, I must say that it's still the best popular text / introduction to complexity theory. I think, it's mainly due to multidisciplinary approach (physics, stats, sociology, economy, in one) and gradual introduction of concepts, which build up to a ... Well that's where the book is coming a bit short. I got a feeling that Philip could have left us with a grim conclusion (i.e. we are going to wipe ourselves out of the surface of the planet in one way or the other? ;-), instead went for much more optimistic warning that models, especially these tackling social issues (big data, AI, deep learning in todays lingo) aren't always correct. Strangely (in context of the author body of work) climate isn't a main future of the book either and sadly it got published a few years before yet another bubble bursting.All in all, superb work, definitely worth the time and a pledge for 2nd edition."
26,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,3,"Here Ball describes how various statistical models from physics can be used to investigate different sociological areas of interest - from crowd flow and the growth of cities to the way that countries aligned themselves in the run-up to WWII and the wisdom or otherwise of Mutually Assured Destruction. ""How intriguing!"", you might be thinking, as I did when I first found the book, but if I may shamelessly nab Ball's theme for a moment, I should caution that I did find my level of interest peaking and falling - a little like a sine wave - around the three-star mark throughout the course of the book, which is a 600-page small monster of a tome. Most fascinating for me were the historical contexts into which these modelling attempts are placed, and the extent to which what seem like modern concerns can be brightly illuminated by the theories of our forebears - Ball incorporates an enormous number of important figures and scientific or philosophical milestones (often quoting the former), but never in a way that feels forced or show-offy; rather, you simply come to realise that these are issues that have been pondered for centuries in one form or another, and that the current states of affairs are not necessarily either inevitable or ideal. Where my attention faltered was during the lengthy descriptions of the models' specifics - I've a fairly scientific background, but after the first 150 pages or so I started skipping over most of the figures, and was even tempted at times to do the same with entire pages of text, although I advise you not to skim-read, as the periodicity of my wave of interest was pretty short - that is, often when I thought I was mired deep in the middle of a lengthy trough of boredom, some interesting tid-bit was waiting just around the corner to nudge me gently back up onto another peak of reading pleasure.I did wonder at times whether some of the topic and model combinations weren't a similie too far, as sometimes the models seemed to reveal little that wasn't obvious, and at other times they seemed to be barely relevant. But part of my doubt may stem from my inability to concentrate during some of the drier passages, so I'll leave it to other, more qualified reviewers to judge Ball on that.Overall, this is a dense but generally very readable and informative book that will leave you considerably more knowledgeable but will probably also make you realise just how much smarter than you some people are - Philip Ball included!Favourite quotes: ""...without change there is nothing to be said.""""...the aim of all utopias, to a greater or lesser extent, is to eliminate real people."""
27,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1066467-bob,2,"I wanted to like this book. I like the premise. And it started out okay. I never knew that there were states of pressure/temperature where matter has an equal chance of branching into either liquid or gas, or liquid or solid. Several chapters kept harping on this same theme. There are actually two states of change, critical states and some other name I don't remember (too bad ""states"" doesn't appear in the Index, nor ""critical"", so good luck trying to look it up.) There's some kind of difference between them: in one the change is instant, one has a steep slope as the change occurs.The first chapters cover things like how paths form in gardens, and how car driver behavior varies in normal and congested conditions. The driving chapter was probably the most interesting one for me, since it concerns one of my daily activities. But then the book moves into economics, the stock market and corporations. It's as if the book decided that maybe it should be a business book; a kind of 
In Search of Excellence
 from the physics angle. Slogging through a series of chapters on these subjects, with nothing that directly relates to my daily life, began to get tedious.The last straw for me was the chapter named ""Join the Club"" which centers on the use of energy landscaping graphs to hindcast why alliances have happened in the past-- among businesses (business again!) and countries in WWII. The author admits that the modeling was simplified, and that data derived most recently to the events being hindcasted resulted in the most accurate hindcasting (which is essentially saying the closer to an event happening that you look toward the event, the more likely you'll know what's going to happen, which is kinda tautological.) As I read the chapter I got the feeling I was witnessing the creation of new predictions of Nostradamus to hindcast past events we already know about. I mean, maybe there is some statistical truth to this, but what about the psychological (in)validity of conjuring a method to discover what's already known? Is there no concept of a double-blind test for judging the validity of statisical hindcasting? More interesting to me would be to know predictions made from the model a few years ago and how accurately they predicted what's unfolded since then.So, at this point I would say the book is definitely a mass, but I don't know how critical it is to my interests."
28,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"In this very interesting book, Philip Ball takes us around through various formalizations of physics, as a method of describing how matter (or energy) is actuated in order to highlight a possible formulation for how society is actuated. Curiously, he starts with Hobbes and then walks through the various material relations. Along the way he notes various new ideas as they describe matter and energy, showing in clear lucid language how this may or may not apply with society.He does come up with some striking similarities for the models, but ultimately this is less a new sociology that is an extension of physics (a new physics) and more of a ""look what I found, isn't this weird?"" kind of text. I would recommend this as a very interesting read, but unlike physics, there isn't an easy correlation of model to actual particulates, in part because while we can see some analogous lines (especially with his prisoner's dilemma or and game theory) he does lack an object of study. Society is too vague, and human agency is not discussed at all. Ball is more interested in how mobs of people have ""emergent properties"" but he does not discuss the role of agency or how these properties might emerge. In this way, despite the thickness of the book, this is more about finding interesting descriptions than it is about creating a working theory with an episteme from which we can build a system of human society. This forms the fatal flaw in the book, if there is one.Thus, if you find this kind of topic interesting, it's well worth the read. It will give you food for thought. Ball writes very clearly, concisely. You get a glimpse at the very interesting but also very diverse fields of study which you may not be aware of. But if you're looking for a manifesto or an outline for how society should work, or how to even approach understanding human groupings as a system, you're bound to be disappointed. Ball seems to find such discussion to be fruitless for himself to contemplate even as he engages the thoughts of others who have attempted such conjecture before.Nonetheless, his revolving around the topic of critical mass or supercritical fluids before phase shifts as a way of describing social relations was of great abstract interest for me. Unfortunately, computer models do not translate well into human interaction in the sense that we have no solid metrics from which to gauge how people vary from one to another."
29,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3012739-bob,4,"How are we (readers) affected by Ball's book ? Such question (although not this particular one) is what the book addresses. From how bacterial colonies form and financial markets crash to how traffic evolves and human behavior is affected by its surrounding, Ball passes over countless of historical facts & scientific details (explained in plain English) showing how many scientists, sociologists, economists & others (even physicists) have been, for ages trying to put down the building blocks (even without a prior knowledge) of a field which is now referred to as ""Social Physics"". One might wonder what social physics aims at. Well, its is not a science yet, but lots of progress has been made over the centuries by countless of investigators (as early as 1600 during which Thomas Hobbes is the key figure in Ball's book) if I may call them so, studying how humans interact (and thus are affected by external & internal influences) & are connected ( through the daily social network or the digital network), companies rise, fall & merge, countries form allies & wage wars, how phase transitions (p.119) changes the behavior of a system or its state & countless of other studies made over the centuries. Through such examples, Ball gives a detailed description of how life in general revolves around his title: Critical Mass. By critical mass, one understands a threshold beyond which the state of a system is abruptly changed. In other words, the critical mass is technically a ""phase transition"". Of course the book doesn't aim at describing phase transition but rather it shows how many of the studies included in the book & many other examples in daily life abide to some kind of phase transition or critical (point) mass. Phase transitions are often also called critical points. Critical points can be found nearly every where in physics. Critical Mass is not a book that belongs to any particular category by itself, but rather dwells into sociology, psychology, physics & statistical physics, mathematics & fractals, chaos & order, game theory & the prisoner's dilemma & many others. It is not just a good read, but one with a great ending [Epilogue:]. It will surely expand your vocabulary & lubricate the traditional thinkers' mind & it's ""linear thinking"" or thought."

Overall, however, I can find no fault with either his approach or the way he presents the information, for he gives a balanced appreciation of both the potential for a 'social physics,' as well as the limitations of such an approach."
31,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,4,"A physics-inspired science of society still seems a bit loopy and unlikely to pan out, at least as a cohesive theory... but this book does collect a bunch of interesting approaches from physics, engineering, economics, computer modeling, math, sociology, etc. Some of it would have been super helpful a year earlier when I was still working in a transportation research lab.Other interesting bits include computer simulation experiments that, while proving nothing, can at least give some indication of how weak your setup can be for you to see an effect. For example, you don't need to assume *severe* racism to end up with a segregated city -- if people have only a very *slight* preference for neighbors of their own race, you're still likely to end up with a lot of mostly-segregated neighborhoods after not-that-many iterations of people moving houses, even if the neighborhoods start out randomly mixed.Not all of it is explained very well, and not all of it sounds like a good idea in the end... but there's a lot of inspiration to be found here for anyone interested in thinking about sociology etc. in new ways."

On the contrary, they are (or at any rate, they once were) often remarkably effective in arranging for goods to be transported, for land to be apportioned between residential, business, and manufacturing districts, and for a lot of activity to be fitted into a small area: 'I retain vivid memories of the astonishment and disbelief expressed by the architecture students to whom I taught urban land economics many years ago when I pointed to medieval cities as marvelously patterned systems that had mostly just 'grown' in response to myriads of individual human decisions. To my students a pattern implied a planner in whose mind it had been conceived and by whose hand it had been implemented. The idea that a city could acquire its pattern as naturally as a snowflake was foreign to them. They reacted to it as many Christian fundamentalists responded to Darwin: no design without a Designer!'''"
33,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18925324-e-k,4,"This is the brief introduction of social physics. The author describes the historical background of the birth of social physics, and many models and case studies that shows how a simple model predicts and gives insights into human collective behaviors. He deals with a wide range of concepts, methodologies and theories: phase transitions, critical states, Ising model, power-law distribution, agent-based model, network theory, and game theory. Such models in social physics provide great analogies for social phenomena. This brings to me an important issue of how to make such abstract models down to earth by introducing more various and complex factors that social science usually considers regarding the same topic.I can tell the author is knowledgeable in philosophy and sociology to some degree. Even though the most of models are not his own, he synthesizes contents from different literature in a well-organized way. This book is very useful to look through the matter of social physics. "

Physical phenomena reveal that characteristic properties emerge from complex systems that can be accurately modeled with tools of modern mathematics; these same mathematical tools also seem to model selected aspects of human society when our actions are considered in large aggregates. This is a math-lite discussion, so those already familiar with power laws, self-organizing criticality, network theory, and the mathematics of phase transitions and extreme value theory won't find this particularly new. But for the rest of us - very intriguing! - Who knew that election outcomes could be studied with the same model used to consider magnet?

Critical Mass is an examination of how individual local interactions give rise to collective behavior that is not predictable and that is influenced by such things as tipping points, paradigm shifts, small world networks, swarming behavior, and game theory. This challenging, and exciting foray dips into physics (phase changes of liquids and solids, critical points, bizarre behavior of superconductors, and statistical mechanics) via historical perspectives and recent publications. It is a great introduction to self organized criticality (SOC), complex adaptive systems, cellular automata and agent based modeling. What makes this book so intriguing is that whether you are a slime mold, a fish swimming in a circular fashion, or a human marching down a busy sidewalk, patterns emerge which are predictable and often eerily similar."

There was a section that described a Bacon number, which is how far away an actor is from acting directly with Kevin Bacon. If he/she acted with him, then his/her number would be 1. If she/he acted with someone who acted with Kevin Bacon her/his number would be 2. and so on down the line. The whole time I was reading this I couldn't help thinking of the Erdos number which is the same scheme only it was with people that wrote a paper with the mathematician Paul Erdos who was famous in the math community for his colaboration with other mathematicians. Another interesting bit was about how we are only six people away from knowing someone who knows someone. There's even a book about those kinds of relationships - Six Degrees by Duncan Watts."

Mr. Ball notes a return to such a scientific view of the social sciences and he examines the application of physical laws to economics and politics.However, it is strange to see how he makes the two mostly unrelated concepts seem very related. For example, how a city grows in size looks like how mold grows on a culture and shows pictures of the two side by side. Many similarities. It is a long read but worth the comparison of hard sciences with social sciences. Is there really a way to predict human behavior using his concepts?"

Halfway through I am about to give up, since it's taken at least that long to ascertain its purpose! Boring. I guess if you were excited by quantum mechanics etc it might have an appeal, but then, humans are not machines, and I find astrobiology more exciting than astrophysics to begin with, now that it's a legitimate field of study.

This book is useful. Knowing ""how one thing leads to another"" (or at least, were we stand on this subject) will give you tools to read and maybe even understand (some of) the world around you.

Applying physics to societies and human behaviours, in other words.Interesting, and worth reading to learn a little more about the math and science. Unsure as yet of the validity of the application to people, however.

Ball gives a reasonable attempt, drawing from mathematical models in physics, chemistry and biology to explain aggregate human behavior. While I like his logic, part of me wants to rebel against what appears to be too pat an explanation for complex behavior. His explanations why collective behavior are not the sum of aggregate behavior are compelling. The book drags in places where he seems to labor a little too hard to prove his case, and it is a bit repetitive about the themes related to Thomas Hobbes and Adam Smith.

Rather, there are two questions: a) How people tend to behave in certain circumstances b) If they behave that way, what happens.Also, it sparked my interest in using models to study behaviour.The last, but not the least, it is quite easy and entertaining to read - popular science at it's finest."

275,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10808044-chico,5,This is the one book I think anyone working on a college degree should read. Changes the way you view the world instantly. You'll never view a flock of birds or a school of fish the same. Few challenging reads are actually worth it. 
276,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17532659-jane-ostler,5,"Absolutely adored this book. As a failure at maths at primary school, made to feel hopeless, and still finding mental arithmatic a challenge, to be able to visualise the big concepts which really affect people's daily lives, this book changed mine!"
277,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7453407-philski,2,Tries way too hard to shoehorn everything into the 'phase change' paradigm when really I think I've seen most of those examples explained quite well and mathematically by fractals (including phase change).
278,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29443038-jakub-podgajniak,4,Incredibly well written book with interesting ideas and written in a way that even someone who has little understanding in math or marketing would understand perfectly. A definitely recommended read for anyone who still doesn't understand how the modern world reached its current situation. 
279,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1546308-jonathan,4,"I read this entire book, I enjoyed it. If you want to read a book of nonfiction, that will interest you, and expose you to new stories and concepts of ""how"" the world works, this would be a good one to try out. "
280,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23263626-mostafa-badreldin,3,"Interesting concepts presented by the author, though a bit longer than it needed to be in my opinion. Also kind of heavy on the academic aspects, many of which I was unfamiliar with. Not the easiest book to get into, but I was curious enough to get through it."
281,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1268977-brendan,5,"Laudable attempt equates magnets, people."
282,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279391-rachel,5,"one of my favorites, relates theories of physics to phenomena in urban planning, economics, technology, etc. "
283,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1422773-gitta,3,Oh this is such a hard slog... I'm considering allowing myself to skip some bits. 
284,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15042-shahab,0,suggested by an academic! :)
285,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3134404-mark-wiliamson,5,"Superb - a real ""food for thought"" book. Despite covering a great many topics I have read a lot on it provide new insights and ways of looking at things. Highly recommended "
286,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975003-matthew,3,"Something of a slow start, but then, I was trying to read it on a plane. The last 150 pages were the payoff. Very interesting way of considering human behavior."
287,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3179348-cole,5,"Only amazing if you're into statistics, physics, and economics. "
288,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892231-luke,2,"Many interesting ideas, but it didn't hold my attention well so it took over two months to finally finish it. Some of it was a bit tongue and cheek also, but still some new good ideas."
289,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973151-jussi-mononen,3,"A mash-up of sociology and physics. Somewhat heavy going at times (understanding of basic physics is helpful), but insightful and fascinating."
290,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818299-willem-van-der-scheun,4,"Interesting point of view of human interactions that puts to question the individual influence on a lot of social behaviour. A must read for politicians and other ""social engineers."""
291,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724256-p,3,Sometimes interesting but generally disorganized history of applying physics to society and where society lines up with physics. 
292,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7875108-victor,3,"Very interesting reflections on physics models applied to sociology, economics... The first half of the book was very captivating to me, although the last half was, by far much, boring."
293,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6546959-gelbzucht,4,"A compelling, inspiring and deeply insightful read about complexity in science, philosophy, economics, traffic, etc."
294,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16525077-alain-van-hoof,3,Liked the physics but was not always charmed by the way the writer interpreted the qoutations of referenced work.
295,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23838777-christopher-gilmour,4,Not as good as Pinker
296,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4939748-patrick,5,"If you want to read one book on complexity, then read Critical mass. Comprehensive, well written."

298,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19440745-steve-clark,4,"A long, but interesting read. There's a fair bit I've read about elsewhere, but this goes deeper into how the actions of people can be modeled. "
299,0374530416,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10725-severyn,4,"Dense but clear. Science with ethics and philosophy as well, which is great."
