0,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Doing all of science in one book is not an easy task, nor is it obvious how to go about it. William Bynum has chosen to provide us with a breezy high speed canter through the history of science, with the keyword being ‘history’. There is a lot of about the people involved and the context, always good from a popular science viewpoint.Bynum manages to do this in an approachable way – almost too approachable sometimes as the style veers between writing for adults and for children. The bumf says ‘this is a volume for young and old to treasure together,’ but it really is neither fish nor fowl. The approach generally speaking is one that works best for adults, but then you get a sentence like ‘Galen was very clever and was not afraid to say so,’ that sounds ever so Janet and John.Perhaps my biggest problem with the book is that while the history side of it was usually fine, the science was not always so. Some of it was just little factual errors – stating that the human appendix has no function – actually it has recently been discovered to have one – or referring to ‘degrees Kelvin’ like ‘degrees Celsius’ where the unit on the Kelvin scale is just kelvins (no degrees). But the problems were more painful when it came to modern physics – it did rather look like the author really didn’t know what he was writing about.He tells us, for instance, that cyclotrons and synchrotrons were used by Chadwick in ‘smashing high-speed neutrons into heavy atoms’ – but these devices can only accelerate charged particles, and Chadwick used slow neutrons from decaying radioactive substances. He also says that the twins paradox ‘is just a thought experiment and could only happen in science fiction’. Well, no, it’s not, and on a small scale with atomic clocks it has been performed many times. He also seems confused about gravity, commenting that in space ‘there is no gravity. Astronauts and their spacecraft are essentially in free fall.’ The last bit is true, but not because there is no gravity – there’s plenty of gravity at the kind of level that, say the ISS orbits. But that free fall means it isn’t felt.The absolute worst example is a paragraph that I find almost entirely without meaning. I would be grateful if anyone could explain this one to me:As Einstein’s E=mc2 tells us, at ever higher speeds – almost the speed of light – in the accelerators the mass is mostly converted into energy. The physicists found that these very fast particles do some fascinating things. The electron emerges unchanged from the accelerator. It is part of a family of force-particles – the leptons.I am baffled. Overall, then I am not sure what the audience for this book is, nor am I happy that they will get any sensible understanding of modern physics.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk"
1,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,5,"This is a good book that nicely packs the most important work of scientists throughout history. In the 2nd century the Chinese learned how to magnetize iron by a method of high heating and cooling which caused it to point in the North-South direction. The Chinese also invented gun powder by blending charcoal, sulphur and potassium nitrate. In this century the Chinese produced the first medical books. Acupuncture also emerged as a medical treatment at this time. Aristotle’s writings dominated scientific thought for a thousand years after his death. Aristotle separated his science into three parts: the living world, the nature of change and the structure of the heavens. He had four elements as well: air, earth, fire and water. However, a few very important scientists followed in their own direction during Antiquity. The first is Euclid. Euclid described points, lines surfaces and volumes in a masterpiece book called “Elements in Geometry” 200 years before the birth of Christ. The next great scientist was Eratosthenes (c. 284-c.192 BC). He used Euclid’s geometry to measure the circumference of Earth. He measured the angle of the sun on the Summer Solstice at Alexandria. He then used the distance from Alexandria to the city Syene and calculated 25,000 miles as the Earth circumference using geometry. The actual distance, as we now know, is 24,901.55 miles. The last of the great ones is Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100- c. 178). He calculated movements of stars, planets and moons. He also charted the universe’s stars positioning. His book was used for centuries as the main source for astronomer education. There are two giants of Medicine – Hippocrates, who is famous for authoring a number of rules, named the Hippocratic Oath, and Galen. I want to focus on Galen however. Galen believed that to be healthy the body needed to be in a balanced state. He thought that the body consisted of four humours-blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm. These were either hot or cold and moist or dry. So diseases that were hot and moist would be treated with cold and dry methods. Galen also was the first doctor to feel a patient’s pulse. He knew by the strength of it if the person carried a disease. He also studied anatomy. He dissected many animals and was able to produce a book describing human organs, based upon his dissections, and their functions aptly entitled “On the Uses of Parts.”Galen also believed in a three part system of spirits, each associated with the most important body organs (liver, heart and brain). He was also subscribed to a theory that many diseases are creations from our own minds. One of the great Chemists was Paracelsus. He devised three basic principles –salt, sulphur and mercury. Salt gives things shape, sulphur is the reason things burn and mercury causes smoky and fluid substances. He believed that outside forces were responsible for causing disease. This opinion differed from Ancient thought so was mostly ignored during his lifetime but would prove true many years later. He also created a cure for one of the most dangerous diseases of his time, Syphilis, by using trace amounts of mercury. I could go on but with so many great scientists mentioned in the book I am just going to leave my review as is for this terrific book."
2,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,1,"Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.If you don’t actually know much about the history of science, this book might well be for you; for me, it was painfully obvious, hitting exactly the topics I expected, skimming over what I expected it to skim. A worse crime, however, is that the author simply wasn’t accurate: if you’re going to write a non-fiction book, it’s important to make sure you don’t speak beyond your research.It does not take much research to find out that Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters are not pictographic representations of language. (To be perfectly accurate, some of the characters echo in form the thing they name; a cow head shape might mean the word cow, for instance. However, the languages also contain phonetic characters.)I didn’t read beyond that. On that point, I knew the author was wrong — on a subject that isn’t even a particular area of expertise for me; how, therefore, could I trust him to have done his research about anything else? If we’re talking deeply technical details, that’s different, but it is widely understood that Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters are not solely logographic. There’s too little time for something where I distrust the research and editing and I’m bored."
3,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69752651-sidak-grewal,4,"I am 13 years old and I have recently finished reading ‘The little history of science’ by William Bynum. I enjoyed this book beyond words. This book comprises forty chapters and in those chapters the author tells us about the pioneers of science and technology. Each chapter is from three to eight pages long and full of interesting facts and stories. The best thing I liked about this book is the way the author explained about each scientist. The author makes each topic interesting for the reader and enhances the reader’s curiosity. The book is interesting and entertaining without compromising on the details.In conclusion, I would recommend this book to all people who are interested in science and wish to know more about its history and the pioneers who shaped the history. "
4,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12487719-antonis,2,"Bynum tries to imitate Gombrich's classic ""A little History of the World"". He is not successful, although it's a good try. Almost all the right parts are there, but the sum does not satisfy the reader. "
5,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45302017-susan,3,Perfect book for someone from a non-Science background and wishes to start their learning from somewhere. This is a little book that tells a grand tale about Science. It is a story of thousands of years of questions that people have asked.
6,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4054541-wayne-mccoy,3,"Briefly comprehensive is the kind of strange oxymoron that would apply to this book. Written in short, digestible chapters, it attempts to explain human science from the development of numbers to the deciphering of the human genome.Written for younger readers, it's the sort of book, I would have devoured easily when I was 12 years old (and would seem to be recommended for about that age). Nitpickers will always point out what is missing, but for a book of about 272 pages, the only thing that might have been helpful might be a reading list for those looking for further information. Of course, any 12 year old boy can use Google to do their own poking about, but a few formalized resources might have been a nice touch.Easy to read, with some humor injected throughout (as well as some intriguing wood cut prints), it's an easy higher level look at a subject that humans have been studying for at least 4,000 years."

8,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82778232-musa,3,"The chapters on physics are inaccurate or misleading a lot of the time, but I found the bits on medicine/biology to be very interesting."
9,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8196123-kevin-bessey,5,"As the title suggests - and which is of no surprise - this book provides an excellent, but brief overview of the history of science. After reading other reviews, I noticed many people were unhappy with the length or subject matter so I guess I went into this one with lower expectations.My background is in biology, so naturally I'd prefer to read more about the history of life sciences, but I thought Bynum did a fair job of mixing the physical and life sciences together. I was a bit surprised that he didn't go into much detail with geology, but I think in all fairness he wanted to stick to the general themes within physical and life sciences, including medicine.My only complaint was that he didn't go too far into the golden age of microbiology. Naturally, by having a greater interest in the life sciences, I was eager to know more about the history and figures of that era. Bynum briefly mentioned spontaneous generation and I was let down that he never mentioned Francesco Redi's meat jar experiments. Instead he discussed Pasteur's broth/flask experiments, which became the final 'kick in the pants' to spontaneous generation.Altogether, if Bynum would have wrote more about what everyone complained about leaving out, this quick read would've turned into a lengthy text book - giving people something else to complain about. I think this book served a great purpose.Pros: a great overview of mankind's journey through science and why it is important.Cons: a ""for more reading on this topic"" section after each chapter would've been nice.Bottom line: a great read for anyone interested in getting the 10,000 foot perspective of science."
10,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5049109-sharla,1,"Well, I found this book rather disappointing. First of all, I was dismayed to discover that it is pitched at about a Grade 6 level, but I suppose that that is more the book store's fault for not putting it in the right section. This book very much subscribes to the perspective that ""science is the only way"" of knowing about the world -- while it is one way, and the most prevalent way, in use, I don't think it is the only way. This book is often preachy about ""how science should be"" and I wondered if the author was ever going to acknowledge that many scientific advances have had terrible consequences (he finally did -- atomic bombs and eugenics being his examples). The controversy caused by the work of scientists such as Galileo and Copernicus, and even Darwin (which is still with us today) seemed to be mostly glossed over. Because the book is presented in chronological order, the topics jump around a lot -- back and forth between primarily chemistry, physics, and biology. Some key definitions were missing -- for example, the book does give the actual distance measured by a light year, but fails to indicate that this distance is the length that light can travel in a vacuum in one year. I found the explanation of Einstein's theories easy to understand, but other explanations were lacking. An enzyme is more than a protein that has a special job (could not one argue, using that definition, that every protein is an enzyme?). I should stop now, because I'm rambling, and end by again saying -- this book was really disappointing."
11,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719392-josie,1,"I love books that look at the history of ideas and was quite disappointed by the old-fashioned, timeline minus analysis approach of this book. The lack of analysis made the book less interesting than it should have been – part of the joy of thinking about the history of science is seeing the gradual or sudden insights into physical world or the world of mathematical ideas and how these insights led to changes in how human beings saw their place in the world.It was also old-fashioned in the sense that the West was front and center in every age, including times when there was little of scientific interest taking place in Europe. Additionally, the author downplays important Chinese and Indian contributions to science and scientific thought by comparing them to contemporary understandings and not to their historical peers. There is no presence of Mayan astronomy or mathematics, or anything else that would indicate that people were doing anything that might be described as scientific thinking in the Americas. "
12,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18833485-sandeep-chopra,2,"As an avid reader of science history, I don’t think this book is up there. It is more like a collection of great names in science and a sentence or two of what they did. Having done this, the author has tried to weave these names together to build a story around these. Some disconnects are obvious, other connects are forced. What results is a drab story. The history of science is fascinating. But introducing someone to this fascinating history with a book like this will only have one result - hatred for the subject. "
13,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47569087-samuel-oktavianus,2,"A while ago, I finished reading A Little History of Philosophy and I've been in love with this series ever since. I was looking forward to reading another of this series, so I tried to get my hands on this one. As you can probably tell from the title, this book is about the history of science, starting from the day it was born up until the present era. Just like any little history series, the book is divided into 40 chapters, and each chapter has its own unique topics. This may sound very long, but each chapter only contains 4-5pages max—not too long or not too short. As I said earlier, the book covers everything about the history of science, from astronomy to medicine to quantum physics. I also admire the linocut-style illustration at the beginning of each chapter.This book can be too dull for some people who already know the basics of science history. Each chapter introduces a new concept very quickly at an almost repeatable pattern, to a point where it becomes super repetitive. I also feel like much of the chapter is dedicated to the history of medicine, and it would be great for every topics to be balanced equally."
14,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56722053-bander,4,"An Amazing historically ordered and well written introduction to science.In 30 chapters, the author tells the story of the development of science over the years. Unlike Gribbin's book  Almost Everyone's Guide to Science: The Universe, Life and Everything, the author explains the scientific facts in a way that's easier to grasp, but not detailed enough. It's not a fault given the purpose of this book. There were chapters on medicine and physicians that I really liked. I found the author digresses occasionally but he soon returns to the original idea. I am planning to read a medical book of his edition, Great Discoveries in Medicine.Bottom line: I highly recommend it to everyone."
15,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63434769-heather-gmiterek,5,"I really enjoyed this book. My high school education left me with some sizeable gaps; science being one of the larger gaping holes. I feel as though I could track along with a scientific conversation after this book. I may even ""get"" a few more of the jokes on Big Bang Theory now! The chapters were short and concise, easily understandable and peppered with interesting bits of history and personal quirks from each scientist it covered. This book would be great for a jr high student on up. "
16,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70007805-katrina,3,"This was a pretty good, brief overview of science history, though it was sprinkled with inaccurate claims about the ""facts"" of evolution. I get so frustrated by these lame attempts to twist science to fit the scientists agenda, when evolution is so obviously false. Right after admiring our ""clockwork universe"", the author goes on to talk about the Big Bang, which is the exact opposite of order. Despite all that, I did really enjoy the actual historical scientific parts of this book. It's worth the read, as long as you skip a couple of chapters... :P"

I suppose if you know nothing about the history of science, it could be a good starting point to see where you interest lies to read more.

21,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7376960-lyn,2,"This book was a marathon that I considered not finishing. It was too dense to be read like a novel. Instead, it should be something read chapter by chapter over the course of a longer period. It also should be read by someone perhaps with less scientific knowledge. I didn’t learn anything new from it but was reminded of findings I had learned previously in school. "
22,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19650834-odin,4,"Not quite as well-written as the other ""Little History"" books I've read so-far (The World, The United States) but definitely as informative as I've come to expect from the series.

41,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15560373-elliot-chalom,2,"I went into this book with very high expectations, having loved A Little History of Philosophy. Nigel Warburton's philosophy book, from the same series, was a terrific launching point before the more daunting task of reading Wittgenstein, Voltaire, etc. which I've now been doing for several months. The goal was for Bynum's science book to act as a similar introduction to ""science"" as a genre, providing a post-high school level base from which to read more. I also hoped it would do what ""Philosophy"" did and provide a taste of different scientific sub-topics so that I know where I would like to explore further. To use a scientific term, this book should have been a catalyst.So why is it mostly a failure?1. As one Goodreads reviewer noted, it's written at about a Grade 6 level, even though it isn't marketed or shelved that way. Yes, the book actually defined the word ""catalyst."" That's a bit elementary.2. The organization is terrible. The chapters are generally ordered chronologically. Does anyone think or write about science, as a broad topic, chronologically? The most obvious way to organize this book would have been by sub-topic - a section on theories of the origin/development of species/man, a section on space, etc. - though other forms of organization may have made sense as well. (I can't even think of the right sub-topics to list after reading this book. That should say it all.)3. We get it - science is wonderful. It;'s the most wonderful thing that has even been or ever will be. Bynum doesn't need to hammer that home in a sunshine and roses way every chapter.I learned a few things so I can't go as low as one star. But I would highly recommend that anyone looking for a framework from which to start learning more about science (anyone like me, who didn't study it in college or beyond) pick up another book."
42,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25898891-r-k,5,"There are very few books that are able to truly enrapture a vast audience with a complex subject and leave them a more learned group. William Bynum is a proficient story teller with his ability to educate the public including those in the science community on the history of science. He covers a vast majority of science topics and gives a nice illustration to the reader of how science has evolved from its predecessors such as Aristotle to present day scientist. He also shows the consistent strain science had, for the most part of its life, with religion. An issue that although may not be as strong today as it was centuries ago, still persists. Each chapter talks about a new scientific advancement and the people responsible for their discovery. Being a member of the science community Being a member of the science community and having a passion for knowledge, I was enthralled by this book. It kept me entertained with its comedic moments and gave me more background on the various subjects of science that are often taught in schools today. Speaking of which, I would highly recommend students, teachers, and other knowledge pursuers to read this book. This book in general is for everyone of all backgrounds but upon reading topics such as Newton's Laws and the discovery of the atom I felt that this little book was able to effectively educate me on how these laws/discoveries came to be. I ended up understanding and enjoying more from this book than 4+ years of textbook reading. It got the message across simply and effectively which is needed in our fast paced world. This book is a must have for all because the more educated the public is in science the better we can make our present and future Earth."
43,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34988305-fabio,5,"A little History of Science 	This is a book for you if you love science. It explains the history of science, from philosophers to the elements, introductions to DNA, physics and so many other important discoveries. One scientist was Aristotle who spent his life learning and teaching and explained a lot of wonders in his notebook. One example from his notes is the observation that a the concept of 0 did not exist. Therefore there was no 10 instead there would be X (used as the roman 10). One aspect of science is that it is almost everywhere. Think about it, it took science to create computers and other devices that we use everyday (sometimes too often). The book also describes the history of science related terms. For example, debugging (in the olden days) actually meant cleaning out the computer because moths and flies could be short circuiting the tubes used in early computers.The book concludes with the theory of the big bang (also known as the theory of everything) which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. Gamow, a Russian scientist, developed the concept of the big bang and that the universe is infinite but couldn't prove his theory. Other theories of the big bang were developed by Penrose and Hawking. They discussed the idea of a dark star/black hole and that one may have started the big bang. Overall the big bang theory has a lot of controversy and it may take many years to prove.“A little History of Science” is one of my favorite books because it explains so many things about science and keeps you wondering about the future.

Bynum shows how science and religion often went together in the past, with the first people doing science being priests. He shows that science can be both simple observation and complex laboratory work or complicated formulas. He shows the development over time and how each new advance built on work done earlier. The writing assumes no prior knowledge of the different aspects of science, with all technical terms explained in words even a child can understand. Bynum makes science both interesting and approachable and shows how science has influenced humans and the world we live in over time. From astronomy to zoology, chemistry to physics, medicine to technology, genetics to geology, he shows the progress over time and the interrelationships between different branches of science.

71,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15560373-elliot-chalom,2,"I went into this book with very high expectations, having loved A Little History of Philosophy. Nigel Warburton's philosophy book, from the same series, was a terrific launching point before the more daunting task of reading Wittgenstein, Voltaire, etc. which I've now been doing for several months. The goal was for Bynum's science book to act as a similar introduction to ""science"" as a genre, providing a post-high school level base from which to read more. I also hoped it would do what ""Philosophy"" did and provide a taste of different scientific sub-topics so that I know where I would like to explore further. To use a scientific term, this book should have been a catalyst.So why is it mostly a failure?1. As one Goodreads reviewer noted, it's written at about a Grade 6 level, even though it isn't marketed or shelved that way. Yes, the book actually defined the word ""catalyst."" That's a bit elementary.2. The organization is terrible. The chapters are generally ordered chronologically. Does anyone think or write about science, as a broad topic, chronologically? The most obvious way to organize this book would have been by sub-topic - a section on theories of the origin/development of species/man, a section on space, etc. - though other forms of organization may have made sense as well. (I can't even think of the right sub-topics to list after reading this book. That should say it all.)3. We get it - science is wonderful. It;'s the most wonderful thing that has even been or ever will be. Bynum doesn't need to hammer that home in a sunshine and roses way every chapter.I learned a few things so I can't go as low as one star. But I would highly recommend that anyone looking for a framework from which to start learning more about science (anyone like me, who didn't study it in college or beyond) pick up another book."
72,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25898891-r-k,5,"There are very few books that are able to truly enrapture a vast audience with a complex subject and leave them a more learned group. William Bynum is a proficient story teller with his ability to educate the public including those in the science community on the history of science. He covers a vast majority of science topics and gives a nice illustration to the reader of how science has evolved from its predecessors such as Aristotle to present day scientist. He also shows the consistent strain science had, for the most part of its life, with religion. An issue that although may not be as strong today as it was centuries ago, still persists. Each chapter talks about a new scientific advancement and the people responsible for their discovery. Being a member of the science community Being a member of the science community and having a passion for knowledge, I was enthralled by this book. It kept me entertained with its comedic moments and gave me more background on the various subjects of science that are often taught in schools today. Speaking of which, I would highly recommend students, teachers, and other knowledge pursuers to read this book. This book in general is for everyone of all backgrounds but upon reading topics such as Newton's Laws and the discovery of the atom I felt that this little book was able to effectively educate me on how these laws/discoveries came to be. I ended up understanding and enjoying more from this book than 4+ years of textbook reading. It got the message across simply and effectively which is needed in our fast paced world. This book is a must have for all because the more educated the public is in science the better we can make our present and future Earth."
73,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34988305-fabio,5,"A little History of Science 	This is a book for you if you love science. It explains the history of science, from philosophers to the elements, introductions to DNA, physics and so many other important discoveries. One scientist was Aristotle who spent his life learning and teaching and explained a lot of wonders in his notebook. One example from his notes is the observation that a the concept of 0 did not exist. Therefore there was no 10 instead there would be X (used as the roman 10). One aspect of science is that it is almost everywhere. Think about it, it took science to create computers and other devices that we use everyday (sometimes too often). The book also describes the history of science related terms. For example, debugging (in the olden days) actually meant cleaning out the computer because moths and flies could be short circuiting the tubes used in early computers.The book concludes with the theory of the big bang (also known as the theory of everything) which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. Gamow, a Russian scientist, developed the concept of the big bang and that the universe is infinite but couldn't prove his theory. Other theories of the big bang were developed by Penrose and Hawking. They discussed the idea of a dark star/black hole and that one may have started the big bang. Overall the big bang theory has a lot of controversy and it may take many years to prove.“A little History of Science” is one of my favorite books because it explains so many things about science and keeps you wondering about the future.

I also hoped it would do what ""Philosophy"" did and provide a taste of different scientific sub-topics so that I know where I would like to explore further. To use a scientific term, this book should have been a catalyst.So why is it mostly a failure?1.

One scientist was Aristotle who spent his life learning and teaching and explained a lot of wonders in his notebook. One example from his notes is the observation that a the concept of 0 did not exist. Therefore there was no 10 instead there would be X (used as the roman 10). One aspect of science is that it is almost everywhere. Think about it, it took science to create computers and other devices that we use everyday (sometimes too often). The book also describes the history of science related terms. For example, debugging (in the olden days) actually meant cleaning out the computer because moths and flies could be short circuiting the tubes used in early computers.The book concludes with the theory of the big bang (also known as the theory of everything) which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. Gamow, a Russian scientist, developed the concept of the big bang and that the universe is infinite but couldn't prove his theory. Other theories of the big bang were developed by Penrose and Hawking. They discussed the idea of a dark star/black hole and that one may have started the big bang.

Bynum shows how science and religion often went together in the past, with the first people doing science being priests. He shows that science can be both simple observation and complex laboratory work or complicated formulas. He shows the development over time and how each new advance built on work done earlier. The writing assumes no prior knowledge of the different aspects of science, with all technical terms explained in words even a child can understand. Bynum makes science both interesting and approachable and shows how science has influenced humans and the world we live in over time. From astronomy to zoology, chemistry to physics, medicine to technology, genetics to geology, he shows the progress over time and the interrelationships between different branches of science. A great introduction to the subject that leaves the reader with many avenues for future investigation."
107,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2324135-michelle,4,"I won a copy of A Little History of Science from a firstreads giveaway, and I was expecting something a bit loftier and academic. Instead, W.F. Bynum has composed a short and sweet synopsis of science, focused on the greatest scientists of history. Bynum starts with ancient Chinese scholars learning to make compasses, and works his way through Plato, Newton, Darwin, Watson and Crick, Babbage, and many others.Bynum's book does for the science what Gombrich's A Little History of the World did for history. It is succinct, and plainly written so that anyone will understand the progress from discovery to discovery that science has made through the ages. Perhaps most importantly, Bynum provides historical context, and acknowledges the outdated world views held during each discovery he catalogues. This is a charming read for anyone wanting to get an idea of the history of science. It covers all fields from geology to medicine, quantum physics tp paleontology and more."
108,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22134423-aleta,1,"This was very much an impulse buy from a year or so ago. I thought it would give this lover of math, disliker of science some shallow water to wet my feet in the sea of science in and hopefully courage to then wade further out. But alas, the water was more than shallow, it was in fact the kiddy pool. I think? As other reviewers have commented, this feels neither nor - as if Bynum himself did not know whether he was writing for adults or children. The so-called scientific history is merely a messy collection of factoids of the general knowledge (or even general ignorance) kind. I knew most of it already and even spotted an error. And this comes from someone who only read the first two chapters - the final straw being when I saw another reviewer mention several minor and major factual errors. That is inexcusable and completely defeats the purpose for which I picked up the book in the first place."

Many names come up that I have never heard a thing about, and yet I definitely should have. Should I blame my rather pathetic Catholic school science education? Well, yes, but it also showed me that I need to do more reading, more learning.This relatable book is one of those that keep you entertained while simultaneously giving knowledge that we also should have some conception of. A quality I particularly enjoy is that it is not as Euro-centric and US-centric as most of my scientific education has been."

The book does this by providing examples from various cultures and periods throughout western and eastern history, discussing facts and putting those facts in the context of specific people and groups. For example, did you know that a group called The Atomists created the theory that atoms are the source of everything in the universe. At the time, some people in Greece believed the universe was made of only 4 elements! So far, A Little History of Science provides a kid's eye view of original scientific thought as it emerged and developed throughout history. Stay tuned...!"

From there Bynum traverses the sciences in chronological order introducing individuals and concepts until he and the reader arrive at computers in our digital age. If you are looking for a readable popularization of science, this is a book for you. Unfortunately, he provides no bibliography or notes for further exploration, so a good place to start, but you need to find more on your own."

The last part, contemporary history seems to have some huge gaps and missing major events. Even if the book were a few years old it was still lacking. It was a little too brief on the more modern aspects, but a great little introductory book into science history and how physics relates to chemistry relates to biology relates to genetics...etc."

Anyone reading this book will get a clear sense, if they didn't have it before, that it is our scientific advances that are chiefly responsible that history still seems to be moving forward to a better and more prosperous future. If for only that reason, it should be read at schools together with regular history textbooks, which usually focus more on battles and kings, and less on the greatly more important and beautiful scientific undercurrent of our past.

The writing assumes no prior knowledge of the different aspects of science, with all technical terms explained in words even a child can understand. Bynum makes science both interesting and approachable and shows how science has influenced humans and the world we live in over time. From astronomy to zoology, chemistry to physics, medicine to technology, genetics to geology, he shows the progress over time and the interrelationships between different branches of science. A great introduction to the subject that leaves the reader with many avenues for future investigation."

161,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15560373-elliot-chalom,2,"I went into this book with very high expectations, having loved A Little History of Philosophy. Nigel Warburton's philosophy book, from the same series, was a terrific launching point before the more daunting task of reading Wittgenstein, Voltaire, etc. which I've now been doing for several months. The goal was for Bynum's science book to act as a similar introduction to ""science"" as a genre, providing a post-high school level base from which to read more. I also hoped it would do what ""Philosophy"" did and provide a taste of different scientific sub-topics so that I know where I would like to explore further. To use a scientific term, this book should have been a catalyst.So why is it mostly a failure?1. As one Goodreads reviewer noted, it's written at about a Grade 6 level, even though it isn't marketed or shelved that way. Yes, the book actually defined the word ""catalyst."" That's a bit elementary.2. The organization is terrible. The chapters are generally ordered chronologically. Does anyone think or write about science, as a broad topic, chronologically? The most obvious way to organize this book would have been by sub-topic - a section on theories of the origin/development of species/man, a section on space, etc. - though other forms of organization may have made sense as well. (I can't even think of the right sub-topics to list after reading this book. That should say it all.)3. We get it - science is wonderful. It;'s the most wonderful thing that has even been or ever will be. Bynum doesn't need to hammer that home in a sunshine and roses way every chapter.I learned a few things so I can't go as low as one star. But I would highly recommend that anyone looking for a framework from which to start learning more about science (anyone like me, who didn't study it in college or beyond) pick up another book."
162,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25898891-r-k,5,"There are very few books that are able to truly enrapture a vast audience with a complex subject and leave them a more learned group. William Bynum is a proficient story teller with his ability to educate the public including those in the science community on the history of science. He covers a vast majority of science topics and gives a nice illustration to the reader of how science has evolved from its predecessors such as Aristotle to present day scientist. He also shows the consistent strain science had, for the most part of its life, with religion. An issue that although may not be as strong today as it was centuries ago, still persists. Each chapter talks about a new scientific advancement and the people responsible for their discovery. Being a member of the science community Being a member of the science community and having a passion for knowledge, I was enthralled by this book. It kept me entertained with its comedic moments and gave me more background on the various subjects of science that are often taught in schools today. Speaking of which, I would highly recommend students, teachers, and other knowledge pursuers to read this book. This book in general is for everyone of all backgrounds but upon reading topics such as Newton's Laws and the discovery of the atom I felt that this little book was able to effectively educate me on how these laws/discoveries came to be. I ended up understanding and enjoying more from this book than 4+ years of textbook reading. It got the message across simply and effectively which is needed in our fast paced world. This book is a must have for all because the more educated the public is in science the better we can make our present and future Earth."
163,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34988305-fabio,5,"A little History of Science 	This is a book for you if you love science. It explains the history of science, from philosophers to the elements, introductions to DNA, physics and so many other important discoveries. One scientist was Aristotle who spent his life learning and teaching and explained a lot of wonders in his notebook. One example from his notes is the observation that a the concept of 0 did not exist. Therefore there was no 10 instead there would be X (used as the roman 10). One aspect of science is that it is almost everywhere. Think about it, it took science to create computers and other devices that we use everyday (sometimes too often). The book also describes the history of science related terms. For example, debugging (in the olden days) actually meant cleaning out the computer because moths and flies could be short circuiting the tubes used in early computers.The book concludes with the theory of the big bang (also known as the theory of everything) which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. Gamow, a Russian scientist, developed the concept of the big bang and that the universe is infinite but couldn't prove his theory. Other theories of the big bang were developed by Penrose and Hawking. They discussed the idea of a dark star/black hole and that one may have started the big bang. Overall the big bang theory has a lot of controversy and it may take many years to prove.“A little History of Science” is one of my favorite books because it explains so many things about science and keeps you wondering about the future. "
164,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19650910-ira-noviani,4,"The book provides a decent summary of the science history in less than 300 pages. It strengthens the points that the science is evolving, and while it was not perfect in the beginning, it gets better subsequently with thousands of scientists improve and expand the work of their predecessors. It also capture the influence of one discovery and development of one field to lead to another discover and improvement of another. One of such example would be the advancement in lens to benefit the astronomy and biology subjects.However, there is a part of my own self that think this book is a bit biased towards the general view that Asian countries do not really make significant contribution throughout the long line of the science journey (apart from being an enabler with the invention of paper and math). The majority of its story discussed the science from the very angle of Anglo-Saxon point of view which I beg to differ. There seems to be some inventions and discoveries from the Asian countries being left out from the book and I wonder if that is due to language barrier that prevents the authors to dig deeper to the East side. A quick search on Google presented a list on Wikipedia of the Asian contribution. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scien..."

I picked up the book at the bookstore in the airport, another impulsive purchase when one loiters at the transit area, awaiting for flight.I rather enjoyed it as the snippets of facts are easy to digest and at times interesting. Issac Newton, for instance, was a titan in his contributions towards the progress of mankind but did not have a pleasant disposition. After reading the bits about the Babylonians and astronomy and how horoscopes came about, I decided it is not worth my while anymore to read my daily horoscope and to find the one based on horoscope compatibility. Interestingly, my company had recently hosted an event with the British High Commissioner in Singapore to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wallace’s death and his contribution. Ironically, when I came to the chapter on Darwin, there were only a couple of lines on Alfred Russel Wallace and his influence on Darwin.

I also hoped it would do what ""Philosophy"" did and provide a taste of different scientific sub-topics so that I know where I would like to explore further. To use a scientific term, this book should have been a catalyst.So why is it mostly a failure?1.

It explains the history of science, from philosophers to the elements, introductions to DNA, physics and so many other important discoveries. One scientist was Aristotle who spent his life learning and teaching and explained a lot of wonders in his notebook. One example from his notes is the observation that a the concept of 0 did not exist. Therefore there was no 10 instead there would be X (used as the roman 10). One aspect of science is that it is almost everywhere. Think about it, it took science to create computers and other devices that we use everyday (sometimes too often). The book also describes the history of science related terms. For example, debugging (in the olden days) actually meant cleaning out the computer because moths and flies could be short circuiting the tubes used in early computers.The book concludes with the theory of the big bang (also known as the theory of everything) which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. Gamow, a Russian scientist, developed the concept of the big bang and that the universe is infinite but couldn't prove his theory. Other theories of the big bang were developed by Penrose and Hawking. They discussed the idea of a dark star/black hole and that one may have started the big bang. Overall the big bang theory has a lot of controversy and it may take many years to prove.“A little History of Science” is one of my favorite books because it explains so many things about science and keeps you wondering about the future.

Bynum shows how science and religion often went together in the past, with the first people doing science being priests. He shows that science can be both simple observation and complex laboratory work or complicated formulas. He shows the development over time and how each new advance built on work done earlier. The writing assumes no prior knowledge of the different aspects of science, with all technical terms explained in words even a child can understand. Bynum makes science both interesting and approachable and shows how science has influenced humans and the world we live in over time. From astronomy to zoology, chemistry to physics, medicine to technology, genetics to geology, he shows the progress over time and the interrelationships between different branches of science.

Bynum starts with ancient Chinese scholars learning to make compasses, and works his way through Plato, Newton, Darwin, Watson and Crick, Babbage, and many others.Bynum's book does for the science what Gombrich's A Little History of the World did for history. It is succinct, and plainly written so that anyone will understand the progress from discovery to discovery that science has made through the ages. Perhaps most importantly, Bynum provides historical context, and acknowledges the outdated world views held during each discovery he catalogues. This is a charming read for anyone wanting to get an idea of the history of science. It covers all fields from geology to medicine, quantum physics tp paleontology and more."

But alas, the water was more than shallow, it was in fact the kiddy pool. I think? As other reviewers have commented, this feels neither nor - as if Bynum himself did not know whether he was writing for adults or children. The so-called scientific history is merely a messy collection of factoids of the general knowledge (or even general ignorance) kind. I knew most of it already and even spotted an error. And this comes from someone who only read the first two chapters - the final straw being when I saw another reviewer mention several minor and major factual errors. That is inexcusable and completely defeats the purpose for which I picked up the book in the first place."

Many names come up that I have never heard a thing about, and yet I definitely should have. Should I blame my rather pathetic Catholic school science education? Well, yes, but it also showed me that I need to do more reading, more learning.This relatable book is one of those that keep you entertained while simultaneously giving knowledge that we also should have some conception of. A quality I particularly enjoy is that it is not as Euro-centric and US-centric as most of my scientific education has been."

The book does this by providing examples from various cultures and periods throughout western and eastern history, discussing facts and putting those facts in the context of specific people and groups. For example, did you know that a group called The Atomists created the theory that atoms are the source of everything in the universe. At the time, some people in Greece believed the universe was made of only 4 elements! So far, A Little History of Science provides a kid's eye view of original scientific thought as it emerged and developed throughout history. Stay tuned...!"

He starts at the beginning with the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians and the concepts of counting (i.e. arithmetic), astronomy, and medicine. From there Bynum traverses the sciences in chronological order introducing individuals and concepts until he and the reader arrive at computers in our digital age. If you are looking for a readable popularization of science, this is a book for you. Unfortunately, he provides no bibliography or notes for further exploration, so a good place to start, but you need to find more on your own."

It is written mostly in layman's terms and language so you don't have to be a scientist to enjoy it. The author takes you back quite a ways in time and develops the beginning of the book well. The last part, contemporary history seems to have some huge gaps and missing major events. Even if the book were a few years old it was still lacking. It was a little too brief on the more modern aspects, but a great little introductory book into science history and how physics relates to chemistry relates to biology relates to genetics...etc."

Science can be really boring if you pay all your attention to its formula and theory. I think what really makes science compelling is its history. Science is rather flexible, everyone can have a different perspectives towards one theory. Descartes thought that ""I think therefore I am"" and I find it really useful.

Anyone reading this book will get a clear sense, if they didn't have it before, that it is our scientific advances that are chiefly responsible that history still seems to be moving forward to a better and more prosperous future. If for only that reason, it should be read at schools together with regular history textbooks, which usually focus more on battles and kings, and less on the greatly more important and beautiful scientific undercurrent of our past.

251,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15560373-elliot-chalom,2,"I went into this book with very high expectations, having loved A Little History of Philosophy. Nigel Warburton's philosophy book, from the same series, was a terrific launching point before the more daunting task of reading Wittgenstein, Voltaire, etc. which I've now been doing for several months. The goal was for Bynum's science book to act as a similar introduction to ""science"" as a genre, providing a post-high school level base from which to read more. I also hoped it would do what ""Philosophy"" did and provide a taste of different scientific sub-topics so that I know where I would like to explore further. To use a scientific term, this book should have been a catalyst.So why is it mostly a failure?1. As one Goodreads reviewer noted, it's written at about a Grade 6 level, even though it isn't marketed or shelved that way. Yes, the book actually defined the word ""catalyst."" That's a bit elementary.2. The organization is terrible. The chapters are generally ordered chronologically. Does anyone think or write about science, as a broad topic, chronologically? The most obvious way to organize this book would have been by sub-topic - a section on theories of the origin/development of species/man, a section on space, etc. - though other forms of organization may have made sense as well. (I can't even think of the right sub-topics to list after reading this book. That should say it all.)3. We get it - science is wonderful. It;'s the most wonderful thing that has even been or ever will be. Bynum doesn't need to hammer that home in a sunshine and roses way every chapter.I learned a few things so I can't go as low as one star. But I would highly recommend that anyone looking for a framework from which to start learning more about science (anyone like me, who didn't study it in college or beyond) pick up another book."

William Bynum is a proficient story teller with his ability to educate the public including those in the science community on the history of science. He covers a vast majority of science topics and gives a nice illustration to the reader of how science has evolved from its predecessors such as Aristotle to present day scientist. He also shows the consistent strain science had, for the most part of its life, with religion. An issue that although may not be as strong today as it was centuries ago, still persists. Each chapter talks about a new scientific advancement and the people responsible for their discovery. Being a member of the science community Being a member of the science community and having a passion for knowledge, I was enthralled by this book. It kept me entertained with its comedic moments and gave me more background on the various subjects of science that are often taught in schools today. Speaking of which, I would highly recommend students, teachers, and other knowledge pursuers to read this book. This book in general is for everyone of all backgrounds but upon reading topics such as Newton's Laws and the discovery of the atom I felt that this little book was able to effectively educate me on how these laws/discoveries came to be. I ended up understanding and enjoying more from this book than 4+ years of textbook reading. It got the message across simply and effectively which is needed in our fast paced world. This book is a must have for all because the more educated the public is in science the better we can make our present and future Earth."
253,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34988305-fabio,5,"A little History of Science 	This is a book for you if you love science. It explains the history of science, from philosophers to the elements, introductions to DNA, physics and so many other important discoveries. One scientist was Aristotle who spent his life learning and teaching and explained a lot of wonders in his notebook. One example from his notes is the observation that a the concept of 0 did not exist. Therefore there was no 10 instead there would be X (used as the roman 10). One aspect of science is that it is almost everywhere. Think about it, it took science to create computers and other devices that we use everyday (sometimes too often). The book also describes the history of science related terms. For example, debugging (in the olden days) actually meant cleaning out the computer because moths and flies could be short circuiting the tubes used in early computers.The book concludes with the theory of the big bang (also known as the theory of everything) which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. Gamow, a Russian scientist, developed the concept of the big bang and that the universe is infinite but couldn't prove his theory. Other theories of the big bang were developed by Penrose and Hawking. They discussed the idea of a dark star/black hole and that one may have started the big bang. Overall the big bang theory has a lot of controversy and it may take many years to prove.“A little History of Science” is one of my favorite books because it explains so many things about science and keeps you wondering about the future. "
254,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19650910-ira-noviani,4,"The book provides a decent summary of the science history in less than 300 pages. It strengthens the points that the science is evolving, and while it was not perfect in the beginning, it gets better subsequently with thousands of scientists improve and expand the work of their predecessors. It also capture the influence of one discovery and development of one field to lead to another discover and improvement of another. One of such example would be the advancement in lens to benefit the astronomy and biology subjects.However, there is a part of my own self that think this book is a bit biased towards the general view that Asian countries do not really make significant contribution throughout the long line of the science journey (apart from being an enabler with the invention of paper and math). The majority of its story discussed the science from the very angle of Anglo-Saxon point of view which I beg to differ. There seems to be some inventions and discoveries from the Asian countries being left out from the book and I wonder if that is due to language barrier that prevents the authors to dig deeper to the East side. A quick search on Google presented a list on Wikipedia of the Asian contribution. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scien..."

I picked up the book at the bookstore in the airport, another impulsive purchase when one loiters at the transit area, awaiting for flight.I rather enjoyed it as the snippets of facts are easy to digest and at times interesting. Issac Newton, for instance, was a titan in his contributions towards the progress of mankind but did not have a pleasant disposition. After reading the bits about the Babylonians and astronomy and how horoscopes came about, I decided it is not worth my while anymore to read my daily horoscope and to find the one based on horoscope compatibility. Interestingly, my company had recently hosted an event with the British High Commissioner in Singapore to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wallace’s death and his contribution. Ironically, when I came to the chapter on Darwin, there were only a couple of lines on Alfred Russel Wallace and his influence on Darwin.

Bynum shows how science and religion often went together in the past, with the first people doing science being priests. He shows that science can be both simple observation and complex laboratory work or complicated formulas. He shows the development over time and how each new advance built on work done earlier. The writing assumes no prior knowledge of the different aspects of science, with all technical terms explained in words even a child can understand. Bynum makes science both interesting and approachable and shows how science has influenced humans and the world we live in over time. From astronomy to zoology, chemistry to physics, medicine to technology, genetics to geology, he shows the progress over time and the interrelationships between different branches of science. A great introduction to the subject that leaves the reader with many avenues for future investigation."

Instead, W.F. Bynum has composed a short and sweet synopsis of science, focused on the greatest scientists of history. Bynum starts with ancient Chinese scholars learning to make compasses, and works his way through Plato, Newton, Darwin, Watson and Crick, Babbage, and many others.Bynum's book does for the science what Gombrich's A Little History of the World did for history. It is succinct, and plainly written so that anyone will understand the progress from discovery to discovery that science has made through the ages. Perhaps most importantly, Bynum provides historical context, and acknowledges the outdated world views held during each discovery he catalogues. This is a charming read for anyone wanting to get an idea of the history of science. It covers all fields from geology to medicine, quantum physics tp paleontology and more."

To use a scientific term, this book should have been a catalyst.So why is it mostly a failure?1. As one Goodreads reviewer noted, it's written at about a Grade 6 level, even though it isn't marketed or shelved that way. Yes, the book actually defined the word ""catalyst."" That's a bit elementary.2. The organization is terrible. The chapters are generally ordered chronologically. Does anyone think or write about science, as a broad topic, chronologically? The most obvious way to organize this book would have been by sub-topic - a section on theories of the origin/development of species/man, a section on space, etc. - though other forms of organization may have made sense as well. (I can't even think of the right sub-topics to list after reading this book. That should say it all.)3. We get it - science is wonderful. It;'s the most wonderful thing that has even been or ever will be. Bynum doesn't need to hammer that home in a sunshine and roses way every chapter.I learned a few things so I can't go as low as one star. But I would highly recommend that anyone looking for a framework from which to start learning more about science (anyone like me, who didn't study it in college or beyond) pick up another book."

William Bynum is a proficient story teller with his ability to educate the public including those in the science community on the history of science. He covers a vast majority of science topics and gives a nice illustration to the reader of how science has evolved from its predecessors such as Aristotle to present day scientist. He also shows the consistent strain science had, for the most part of its life, with religion. An issue that although may not be as strong today as it was centuries ago, still persists. Each chapter talks about a new scientific advancement and the people responsible for their discovery. Being a member of the science community Being a member of the science community and having a passion for knowledge, I was enthralled by this book. It kept me entertained with its comedic moments and gave me more background on the various subjects of science that are often taught in schools today. Speaking of which, I would highly recommend students, teachers, and other knowledge pursuers to read this book. This book in general is for everyone of all backgrounds but upon reading topics such as Newton's Laws and the discovery of the atom I felt that this little book was able to effectively educate me on how these laws/discoveries came to be. I ended up understanding and enjoying more from this book than 4+ years of textbook reading. It got the message across simply and effectively which is needed in our fast paced world. This book is a must have for all because the more educated the public is in science the better we can make our present and future Earth."
283,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34988305-fabio,5,"A little History of Science 	This is a book for you if you love science. It explains the history of science, from philosophers to the elements, introductions to DNA, physics and so many other important discoveries. One scientist was Aristotle who spent his life learning and teaching and explained a lot of wonders in his notebook. One example from his notes is the observation that a the concept of 0 did not exist. Therefore there was no 10 instead there would be X (used as the roman 10). One aspect of science is that it is almost everywhere. Think about it, it took science to create computers and other devices that we use everyday (sometimes too often). The book also describes the history of science related terms. For example, debugging (in the olden days) actually meant cleaning out the computer because moths and flies could be short circuiting the tubes used in early computers.The book concludes with the theory of the big bang (also known as the theory of everything) which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. Gamow, a Russian scientist, developed the concept of the big bang and that the universe is infinite but couldn't prove his theory. Other theories of the big bang were developed by Penrose and Hawking. They discussed the idea of a dark star/black hole and that one may have started the big bang. Overall the big bang theory has a lot of controversy and it may take many years to prove.“A little History of Science” is one of my favorite books because it explains so many things about science and keeps you wondering about the future.

284,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19650910-ira-noviani,4,"The book provides a decent summary of the science history in less than 300 pages. It strengthens the points that the science is evolving, and while it was not perfect in the beginning, it gets better subsequently with thousands of scientists improve and expand the work of their predecessors. It also capture the influence of one discovery and development of one field to lead to another discover and improvement of another. One of such example would be the advancement in lens to benefit the astronomy and biology subjects.However, there is a part of my own self that think this book is a bit biased towards the general view that Asian countries do not really make significant contribution throughout the long line of the science journey (apart from being an enabler with the invention of paper and math). The majority of its story discussed the science from the very angle of Anglo-Saxon point of view which I beg to differ. There seems to be some inventions and discoveries from the Asian countries being left out from the book and I wonder if that is due to language barrier that prevents the authors to dig deeper to the East side. A quick search on Google presented a list on Wikipedia of the Asian contribution. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scien..."

I picked up the book at the bookstore in the airport, another impulsive purchase when one loiters at the transit area, awaiting for flight.I rather enjoyed it as the snippets of facts are easy to digest and at times interesting. Issac Newton, for instance, was a titan in his contributions towards the progress of mankind but did not have a pleasant disposition. After reading the bits about the Babylonians and astronomy and how horoscopes came about, I decided it is not worth my while anymore to read my daily horoscope and to find the one based on horoscope compatibility. Interestingly, my company had recently hosted an event with the British High Commissioner in Singapore to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wallace’s death and his contribution. Ironically, when I came to the chapter on Darwin, there were only a couple of lines on Alfred Russel Wallace and his influence on Darwin. An easy to read book for this era when we are competing with the Internet for readers' attention. "
286,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14633278-shonna-froebel,5,"This book consists of short chapters (around 6 pages each) taking us from the beginnings of science to the present. Bynum shows how science and religion often went together in the past, with the first people doing science being priests. He shows that science can be both simple observation and complex laboratory work or complicated formulas. He shows the development over time and how each new advance built on work done earlier. The writing assumes no prior knowledge of the different aspects of science, with all technical terms explained in words even a child can understand. Bynum makes science both interesting and approachable and shows how science has influenced humans and the world we live in over time. From astronomy to zoology, chemistry to physics, medicine to technology, genetics to geology, he shows the progress over time and the interrelationships between different branches of science. A great introduction to the subject that leaves the reader with many avenues for future investigation."
287,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2324135-michelle,4,"I won a copy of A Little History of Science from a firstreads giveaway, and I was expecting something a bit loftier and academic. Instead, W.F. Bynum has composed a short and sweet synopsis of science, focused on the greatest scientists of history. Bynum starts with ancient Chinese scholars learning to make compasses, and works his way through Plato, Newton, Darwin, Watson and Crick, Babbage, and many others.Bynum's book does for the science what Gombrich's A Little History of the World did for history. It is succinct, and plainly written so that anyone will understand the progress from discovery to discovery that science has made through the ages. Perhaps most importantly, Bynum provides historical context, and acknowledges the outdated world views held during each discovery he catalogues. This is a charming read for anyone wanting to get an idea of the history of science. It covers all fields from geology to medicine, quantum physics tp paleontology and more."
288,0300136595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22134423-aleta,1,"This was very much an impulse buy from a year or so ago. I thought it would give this lover of math, disliker of science some shallow water to wet my feet in the sea of science in and hopefully courage to then wade further out. But alas, the water was more than shallow, it was in fact the kiddy pool. I think? As other reviewers have commented, this feels neither nor - as if Bynum himself did not know whether he was writing for adults or children. The so-called scientific history is merely a messy collection of factoids of the general knowledge (or even general ignorance) kind. I knew most of it already and even spotted an error. And this comes from someone who only read the first two chapters - the final straw being when I saw another reviewer mention several minor and major factual errors. That is inexcusable and completely defeats the purpose for which I picked up the book in the first place."

It might seem to give short shrift to all subjects, but the fact is, if you all of the material in the contents of this book-- I mean, really know it, you would be highly educated.I picked up many tidbits of information, and found large gaps in my knowledge of science. Many names come up that I have never heard a thing about, and yet I definitely should have. Should I blame my rather pathetic Catholic school science education? Well, yes, but it also showed me that I need to do more reading, more learning.This relatable book is one of those that keep you entertained while simultaneously giving knowledge that we also should have some conception of. A quality I particularly enjoy is that it is not as Euro-centric and US-centric as most of my scientific education has been."

The book does this by providing examples from various cultures and periods throughout western and eastern history, discussing facts and putting those facts in the context of specific people and groups. For example, did you know that a group called The Atomists created the theory that atoms are the source of everything in the universe. At the time, some people in Greece believed the universe was made of only 4 elements! So far, A Little History of Science provides a kid's eye view of original scientific thought as it emerged and developed throughout history. Stay tuned...!"

He starts at the beginning with the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians and the concepts of counting (i.e. arithmetic), astronomy, and medicine. From there Bynum traverses the sciences in chronological order introducing individuals and concepts until he and the reader arrive at computers in our digital age. If you are looking for a readable popularization of science, this is a book for you. Unfortunately, he provides no bibliography or notes for further exploration, so a good place to start, but you need to find more on your own."

It is written mostly in layman's terms and language so you don't have to be a scientist to enjoy it. The author takes you back quite a ways in time and develops the beginning of the book well. The last part, contemporary history seems to have some huge gaps and missing major events. Even if the book were a few years old it was still lacking. It was a little too brief on the more modern aspects, but a great little introductory book into science history and how physics relates to chemistry relates to biology relates to genetics...etc."

Science can be really boring if you pay all your attention to its formula and theory. I think what really makes science compelling is its history. Science is rather flexible, everyone can have a different perspectives towards one theory. Descartes thought that ""I think therefore I am"" and I find it really useful. It is always about the word 'think' through our learning towards science and other subjects. "

Anyone reading this book will get a clear sense, if they didn't have it before, that it is our scientific advances that are chiefly responsible that history still seems to be moving forward to a better and more prosperous future. If for only that reason, it should be read at schools together with regular history textbooks, which usually focus more on battles and kings, and less on the greatly more important and beautiful scientific undercurrent of our past.

He believes magic, religion, technology, and science have been the tools to understand and control the world. I would have been confused in a number of places if I hadn't already known a fair amount about the topics, so I wouldn't consider it an introductory book.

And for old people who don't mind a quick romp through familiar territory. OK, done, and I must say it goes downhill a bit as it reaches the 20th century. Maybe the material is too extensive (and my own knowledge a bit more), but the last section is not impressive. "
