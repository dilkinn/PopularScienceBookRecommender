0,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Yeah, you see. I’ve just checked and most of the other reviews of this book do pretty much what I thought they would do. They complain about the tone. This guy is never going to win an award for modesty and he probably thinks you are stupid and have wasted your life. And it gets worse – like that quote from Oscar Wilde that has tormented me for years: “Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do”, this guy reckons that if you work for more than an hour or so per day you are probably too stupid to know (or deserve) any better.Do you hate him yet? I didn’t. I found him very amusing. Admittedly, I probably wouldn’t want to be stuck beside him on a long flight somewhere – but I don’t really go on long flights anywhere, so it doesn’t make too much sense using that as a criterion for anything.Let’s make a proper start. I’m going to tell you something about Heraclitus. Probably best known for some pithy little quotes about change that he made up all by himself a very long time ago. “You can never stand in the same river twice” – “All is flux”. Heraclitus’s vision of the world was that what is important is change, everything else is transitory and impermanent. Bertrand Russell claims that Heraclitus came from an aristocratic family that ended up dashed agains the rocks of change and not nearly so well off. The other thing you might need to know about Heraclitus was that he was known as ‘The Obscure’.I was reminded constantly of Heraclitus while reading this book. The author was also from a well off family that lost everything in the Lebanese War. This also made him focus on change and the nature of unpredictable events. Hardly surprising then that Popper is his favourite philosopher – there is no ultimate truth, rationality is more or less prejudice, everything is awaiting falsification.I have a love/hate relationship with Karl Popper. I can never work out if he is incredibly naïve (as Taleb proudly boasts that he is) or if he is terribly profound. I do like his idea that we should constantly seek to prove our most beloved theories wrong – but I also think that this level of scepticism is somewhat overstated. There is a line in this book in which we are informed (well, twice actually) that Newton was proven wrong by Einstein. Oh, was he just? I guess all those people shot through the head by guns aimed after the careful application of Newton’s laws of motion suddenly came back to life again then did they? I guess Neil Armstrong, who got to the moon on Newtonian physics, not on the front seat of one of Einstein’s light rays, might also have been a bit surprised at this remarkable over-throw.Okay, I know, I’m nitpicking, but then again, Taleb does ask for it. He is so contemptuous of the ignorance and foolishness of others that it does become a bit of a sport for him. The one thing you can say about Taleb is that he is not like Heraclitus when it comes to being obscure. He is always very clear, very comprehensive and very interesting.We should now do some of the people he particularly hates. And in the first rank of those he hates are probably Journalists. Now, it is hard not to agree with him there. He sees Journalism as basically part of the entertainment industry and believes they only really go ‘wrong’ when they start to think they serve some purpose beyond entertainment. Then there are business people, who he believes are mostly thick. One of the main contentions of his book is that successful people are often successful by pure chance. As such their abiding emotion should be gratitude. However, as he repeatedly points out, we all tend to believe our successes are proof of our own genius, and that it is only our failings that are the result of bad luck and chance.This book gives a wonderful introduction to many of the fallacies we humans are all too prone to make. He makes a cogent argument that we can never be ‘purely rational’ because we need our emotions to short-circuit the endless decision loop that each ‘purely rational’ decision would involve. This book is also a great introduction to probability theory without too many numbers – to the theory without the calculus. Some of his verbal explanations of mistakes are remarkably clear – so clear they virtually jump from the page.One of the constant themes that I found particularly interesting was that we all suffer from hindsight bias. This is something I will definitely be taking from this book. The idea is that because what has happened in the past has ‘happened’ we think it is the only thing that could have happened and then use it to predict what will happen in the future. We forget that events in the past were also the culmination of probabilistic situations that have resolved one way and not another. We forget that these events could just as easily have resolved in another equally probable outcome - one that merely did not occur. The range of fallacies that he shows spring from this one bias is quite remarkable.Now, I was recommended this book by someone called Yuri and the funniest story in the book also starred someone called Yuri. It is when he is discussing Stock Market people applying for jobs with him. One of the things they tend to put on their CVs is that they play chess. They do this because playing chess means they are both ‘analytical’ and ‘strategic’. These are obviously good things to be - in fact, I think I would like to be both of these things. Since you can be both of these things just by declaring yourself to be them, we shall take it as read from now on that I am both of these. Taleb tends to prefer to associate with Russian Physicists, not just because they think like him, but also because they can give him lessons in chess and teach him to play piano. When one of these new stock market trader types applies for a job and says that they play chess – Taleb brings this up and then says, “And this is Yuri who will now continue the interview”. And here Yuri appears with a chess board in front of him…I once watched a Russian playing a non-Russian at chess. The Russian spent the entire time laughing his head off after every move. I don't know if it was because the moves made by his opponent were so useless that he truly found them funny or because this was all part of the psychological warfare - but he did slaughter his non-Russian opponent, so perhaps a bit of both.This is another book inspired by behavioural economics (like Freakonomics and Predictably Irrational - I'm becoming a bit of a fan of behavioural economics.If you take this book in good humour, if you allow yourself to listen and not get worked up about his ‘inappropriate tone’ (god save us from those who complain about inappropriate tone) you will learn something from this book and maybe even have a good time.And I can do a two word review of this book - Shit Happens!"
1,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,2,"Renowned statistician George Box once said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” The author of Fooled by Randomness is all over the first part of this statement, but apparently doesn’t consider it part of his job as an iconoclast to say anything about the second. Taleb goes to great lengths to point out how some of the original assumptions made in investments and finance have blown up in people’s faces. Yes, unusual events do happen more often than a normal distribution suggests. Yes, relationships among securities can change in meltdown scenarios. And yes, people are regularly fooled into thinking luck is skill. However, some market participants are clear-sighted enough to see those shrouded risks for what they are and make better assumptions about how they should be traded off against expected returns. These more enlightened investors don’t get the print, though, since they’re not the straw men Taleb can knock down.Don’t get me wrong. We all like debunking stodgy, established wisdom when we see the holes. If you’re like Taleb, though, and see only holes, what you’re left with is nothing. What might there be in its place? Some models, when tweaked, are still useful.In a brief moment of modesty, Taleb confesses to psychological weaknesses that can lead him to mistake noise for signal. He seems rather smug about it all, though. It’s like he figures his ability to recognize himself as a fool puts him on a higher plane. For the most part, his ego is openly displayed. It’s also coupled with an axe to grind – an aggressive combination. His fund has consistently underperformed (though he would counter that he’s positioned just right for the coming holocaust). His investment strategy boils down to buying lots and lots of insurance contracts against rare occurrences that he thinks will be slightly less rare. (In actuality, he buys stock options, but the insurance metaphor illustrates the point.) The problem is he’s so firm in his belief that the insurance companies have underestimated risks that he thinks all premiums are too low. However, those selling options, armed with models that account for rare events appropriately, will charge more than enough to cover those risks.Who will be fortune’s fool? Time will tell, but a provocateur like Taleb will in all probability be better known for his quasi-epistemological exposition on unanticipated variability than for any true investment success."

Instead he reverts to generalization using fantasy scenarios. He deprecates losers without seeking to explain and understand those loser minds he excoriates.

4,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I'm not certain if it was this book I read or Black Swan by the same author. Importantly I was not convinced by the blurbs or the reviews that there is any great significance in which one, if any, of these two books you may read.It is one of those books with an interesting premise that grows steadily less interesting as you read. And as I read I had the growing feeling that the book could have been conveniently summarised in a dozen and a half bullet points with a few anecdotes tacked on for amusement. This naturally led me to resent both the time I spent reading it and the author for stretching a good magazine article into book length.What the author has to say is interesting (view spoiler)[ at least at first, after a few repetitions it starts to get a bit stale (hide spoiler)] and it has to be said that skill is required to repeat your ideas repetitively in repetition and to repeatedly stretch repetitively those repeated ideas that would have been enough for a ten or fifteen page article repetitively over three hundred plus pages of repetition. Having said that I did have a warm feeling of Schadenfreude at the plight of the broker who lost everything and was last seen in his string vest smoking a cigarette to death as his few unreprocessed chattels were loaded on to the back of a very small van.The notion of the black swan sums up his argument ie until Europeans arrived in Australia none of them had any idea that there was such a thing as a black swan. In the same way in the markets, or more generally in any activity, you can't calculate the risk or probability of an event if it's never happened - or as in the case of a black swan, if you can't even conceive of the very possibility of the event, the kind of things famously described by Donald Rumsfeld as the 'unknown unknowns'.Reading one gets the impression that Taleb is modestly impressed by his own brilliance, one could well believe that he talks about himself in the third person like Caesar in Asterix, and that he is something of what might be technically described as an arsehole.Borrow don't buy. Even better - borrow the Reader's Digest version."
5,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733227-philip,3,"I love the theses that he has in the book, but jesus christ, this is horribly written.I think the powerful ideas could have been condensed down to a New Yorker length article: 1. We tend to see the ""survivors""; by hiding those who have failed, our understanding of many systems is skewed.2. Leveraged betting on conventional wisdom provides consistent returns in the short run, but can explode when something weird happens (his ""black swan idea"").3. You can reproduce the results of many systems by simulating randomness. These simulations produce clear ""winners"" - winners that we would have a hard time believing are due to randomness alone.#3 has a lot of implications for wall street: sets of investment vehicles as a whole underperform the averages after fees (which I was surprised that he didn't bring up...)Another idea I really liked is how he describes opportunity sets. He talks about how, for instance, in an upscale neighborhood a janitor who won the lottery may live next to a dentist. Many of us take this information and attribute the likelihood for success as a janitor and a dentist to be closer than it actually is. But being a janitor provides an individual with an opportunity set, with, say a 1% chance of having a high standard of living and a 99% chance of having a low standard living. The dentist opportunity set may be 95% for high standard of living and 5% for low standard of living. But if there are many more janitors than dentists and you live in an upscale neighborhood (where you only see the survivors), that relationship becomes muddled.Anyway, if you believe the preceding ideas, the book doesn't offer much else."
6,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221212-tara,2,"One of my business school professors raved about this book. I expected to get an entertaining and informative investment professional's take on how our irrational tendencies keep us from applying basic probabilities that would help us make better decisions.Instead, this book read like a pretentious, ranting diary. In the introduction, the author brags that he ignored nearly all of the suggested changes his book editors made (he labels book editors along with journalists, MBAs, and most social scientists as dimwits). I think with significant editing, this book could have been quality. There are several good anecdotes that illustrate how we ignore rational information and simple probabilities in daily life. This would have been fun to read about without the author's smug self-absorption and his personal attacks (the author takes at least four pages to rant about the ""incompetence"" of journalist George Will and even takes a few punches at Warren Buffett... I mean Warren Buffett?). I was barely able to bring myself to finish this book but did because I wanted to be able to give it a fair review. My advice - skip it!"
7,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4353795-greg-linster,5,"Using his trademark aphoristic bent, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “Arrogance in persons of merit affronts us more than arrogance in those without merit: merit itself is an affront”. I’ve come to realize that some people find Nassim Taleb’s arrogance quite repugnant, but, personally, I find it rather charming. I suspect that the same people who find Taleb’s arrogance off-putting are the people who wish they possessed a shred of his erudition. Nietzsche was certainly on to something; it’s hard to avoid being offended by your betters.I think I first read Fooled By Randomness circa 2006. Recently, I felt a longing to reread Taleb’s first non-technical book again. Wow, what a wise decision that was! I actually digested more from the rereading than I did from the initial reading (and I digested quite a bit from the first reading). Both times, I focused on reading the book very, very slowly. Obviously, the fact that I spent the time to reread this book is indicative of how valuable I think it is.Known for his great wit, the baseball pitcher Vernon Louis “Lefty” Gomez was fond of saying that, “I’d rather be lucky than good.” This phrase, in essence, is one of the central themes of the book. Although it sounds like a hackneyed platitude, Gomez, understood the role of randomness in our lives. However, due to myriad biases, we humans often tend to attribute our successes to our skill and blame bad luck for our failures. Is your rich neighbor or your boss really as skilled as she thinks she is?Parts of the book are also about the hindsight bias and the narrative fallacy. We humans are great at fabricating post hoc narratives about our world. It’s how we understand (and misunderstand) the world, but we must remember not to take our stories too seriously. “A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact,” writes Taleb, “but in the light of the information until that point.”One of Taleb’s favorite philosophers is Karl Popper. However, Taleb wasn’t always enthralled with the man who espoused the beauty of empirical falsification. Prior to rediscovering the great philosopher, Taleb went through a self identified anti-intellectual phase early in his career as a trader. He feared becoming a corporate slave with “work ethics” (a term which he interprets to mean inefficient mediocrity). “Philosophy, to me,” Taleb writes, “became something rhetorical people did when they had plenty of time on their hands; it was an activity reserved for those who were not well versed in quantitative methods and other productive things. It was a pastime that should be limited to late hours, in bars around the campuses, when one had a few drinks and a light schedule — provided one forgot the garrulous episode as early as the next day. Too much of it can get a man in trouble, perhaps turn one into a Marxist ideologue.” As they say, the dose determines the poison.Speaking of poison, another interesting idea that Taleb espouses is that being too attached your beliefs is poisonous. As he puts it: “Loyality to ideas is not a good thing for traders, scientists, — or anyone”. I like to think about it this way, there are times we shouldn’t trust experts precisely because they are experts. This is because they are no incentives to be brutally critical of your own ideas. A scientist or a preacher who has built their career on a certain idea obviously has a lot invested in that idea. How likely are they to be critical of their own position when their livelihood depends on it being accepted? What if they are putting out pseudo-scientific nutritional guidelines that cause harm, but help them keep their job?According to Popper there are only two types of theories:1) Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected (he calls them falsified).2) Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong.If you accept Popper’s epistemology, like I also do, you can never claim that you know a theory to be true. In other words, we can only gain knowledge through proving that things are false. For instance, when I accidentally find myself in a theistic debate, people often challenge me to tell them how the universe came into existence. When I say ‘I don’t know’, they become infuriated. How dare I have the gall to dismiss some of their religion’s claims as not true without projecting my own claim to reality? Yet, that’s exactly the point. I gain knowledge through knowing what’s wrong, not through making claims about what I think is right.So what should we make of Taleb’s extreme and obsessive Popperism in a more practical sense? How does he recommend we apply to it our lives? I think it can be summarized in the following passage:I speculate in all of my activities on theories that represent some vision of the world, but with the following stipulation: No rare event should harm me. In fact, I would like all conceivable rare events to help me. My idea of science diverges with that of the people around me walking around calling themselves scientists. Science is mere speculation, mere formulation of conjecture.The following thought experiment really helped me internalize this message. Assume you participate in a gambling game that has 999/1000 chance of winning $1 [Event A] and a 1/1000 chance of winning $10,000 [Event B]. Using some straightforward calculations the expectation of a loss is roughly $9 (multiply the probabilities by the outcome for each event and then sum them) Which event would you bet on? I suspect that most people consider the frequency or probability in their decision, but this is totally irrelevant. According to Taleb, even people like MBAs and economists with some statistical training fail to understand this point. The magnitude of the outcome should be the only relevant factor in the decision. Think of a trader who focuses on event B, sure, he is likely to bleed slowly for long periods of time, but when the rare event happens the payoff is astronomical compared to the losses. Most of us, however, are schooled in environments that focus on games with symmetrical outcomes (e.g., a coin toss). The great psychologist and father of behavioral economics, Daniel Kahneman, also reminds us that we are loss averse and psychologically struggle with idea of bleeding out small losses for extended periods of time, even if there is eventually the opportunity for a huge payday.Once you realize that life is full of scenarios with asymmetrical payoffs, you’re thinking (if you’re anything like me anyway) will be permanently altered. In fields like, say, writing, the outcomes are asymmetrical. In other words, there is not a linear relationship with the number of hours spent writing and the amount of income one makes. One may spend a long time writing for free and then finally catch a huge book deal. For me, this is somewhat of a moot point because I’d write for free without any other justification other than the fact that it’s fun and makes me happy. However, if all other things were equal, and I could also make money doing something I love, I would be very happy.Here’s another piece of practical wisdom that I really enjoyed: “stay away from people of a competitive nature, as they have a tendency to commoditize and reduce the world to categories, like how many papers they publish in a given year, or how they rank in the league tables.” These are the same kinds of people who think that their GPA reflects their intelligence. Or that the number of hours they spend running on a treadmill reflects their fitness. Or that their inherited wealth says something about their genetic fitness. Or that their expensive clothes make them beautiful. I could continue on and on, but I think you get the point.I often hear those around me complaining about how life will be better when they achieve “X”. Alas, I’m human and guilty of making claims like this on occasion too. The trouble is that, for most of us anyway, we won’t really experience long-term improvements in our happiness when we achieve “X”. Throughout the book, Taleb devotes a fair amount of time alerting readers of what the literature in behavioral economics tells us about our irrational tendencies and biases.For example, there’s the social treadmill effect: you get rich, move to rich neighborhoods, then become poor again once you compare yourself to your new peers. Then, you may work your ass off and get rich again, only to repeat the cycle. If you want to feel worse about yourself, then the best piece of positive advice I know of is to hang around people who are wealthier than you. I often try to remind myself that I’m living a life that is materially better than 99.9% of all humans that have ever existed and yet I still have the audacity to claim that I don’t have enough sometimes. Pathetic.At one point in the book, Taleb writes: “I see no special heroism in accumulating money, particularly if, in addition, the person is foolish enough to not even try to derive any tangible benefit from wealth (aside from the pleasure of regularly counting the beans)”. In other words, money is only valuable if you use it as a tool to extract enjoyment from life.If it isn’t clear, I think he is making reference to the likes of Warren Buffett, whom people tend to see as being virtuous simply for the fact that he has been able to accumulate hordes of money. What I think many people fail to understand is that there is nothing virtuous about having money just for the sake of having it. How someone earned what they have tells you a lot more about them than how much they have. We generally tend to think that having money signals other traits about a person, but I’ll remind you that there is a lot of noise in those signals (think inheritance). Having money doesn’t necessarily signal any superior traits.Those who want to make a lot of money are greedy and shouldn’t try to deny that motivation. Greed, however, is not necessarily a bad thing. As Adam Smith taught us, another mans’ greed can create more wealth for society as a whole (provided the individual’s wealth is ethically obtained).Do cigarette smokers understand probabilities? If so, how can they rationally understand the ills of cigarettes and yet be foolish enough to smoke them anyway? When I go for walks near hospitals I’m always surprised by the number of people in scrubs (perhaps some of whom are doctors and nurses) who I assume are well aware of how harmful cigarettes are, but smoke them anyway. Apparently, intellectually understanding something and being able to put it into practice are two different things.One thing Taleb also writes about is the selection bias in blogging and book reviewing. The cover of my edition of Fooled By Randomness has an excerpt praising Taleb as one of the “hottest thinkers” in the world. While I certainly agree, I couldn’t help but smirk after reading that line — can you say selection bias?Any book that is worth reading twice is worth reading more than twice. When you love a writer, you want to hear his opinion on just about everything.- See more at: http://coffeetheory.com/2010/05/25/bo..."

He also makes some laugh at people that use statistics but can't understand it, this makes this book even more readable.

10,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,2,"This book is a lot of painful reading for little reward, as there was nothing truly remarkable or revelatory about Taleb's insights. Most of what can be said of this book has already been said by other reviewers on GoodReads, so I will just briefly recap here: he is incredibly unlikeable, and infuses the book with anecdote and a general disdain for most of humanity, while exemplifying many of the characteristics he rails against. His insights will not be news to anyone who has read even a little bit about statistics, decision making under uncertainty, and behavioural economics. Part II is markedly better than Part I because he finally delves into what I (foolishly?) thought that the book was supposed to be about, but you have to make it through 130 pages of arrogance and badly composed narrative. Part II would have been pretty good if I hadn't read a lot of other books on the topics, and for those who are interested in economic markets, I think this would interest you if you can move past the constant interjections of Taleb's personal philosophy. Personally, my eyes glaze over when I read about trading, and I much prefer books like The Drunkard's Walk, which illustrates many of the same (but also many more) concepts. I was happy to read the section on Tversky and Kahneman, but I find their work infinitely more interesting and readable than his summary, and you are spared the normative commentary. Ironic for a man who criticises the normative dimensions of economics, Taleb certainly pushes a strong view of the world. When Taleb does delve into intriguing concepts, I was frustrated with the fact that he explained them poorly and incompletely, and quickly moved on to another topic. Much of the anecdote in the book could have been removed to make way for the real substance of the book. I don't really disagree with his criticisms of MBAs, economists, traders, journalists, etc., but I also don't think anything he says is especially revealing of insightful for most of us who aren't involved in the trading world. All in all, I am really puzzled by the popularity of this book, and I would strongly recommend against bothering with this one. If you're really interested in randomness, I would recommend The Drunkard's Walk."
11,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136820-nicholas,3,"""Expect the unexpected"" -- an aphorism that almost completely summarises the book. Cliches exist for a reason, but 196 pages later I feel the point has been well made.Taleb is a stock market trader. As a trader, he believes that there is no way in general to predict the stock market -- that there are so many variables that the resulting stock price is indistinguishable from pure noise. Unfortunately, his profession is filled with people who believe that they *can* predict the market. In fact, some of these people trade very successfully for a while. Taleb belives that no trader can stay ahead of the market forever. The success of a small number of traders for a short amount of time can simply be explained by statistics: after all, given a large enough group of traders, some are bound to be successful some of the time even if their trades are entirely random.This point is well illustrated with many examples, and this is where the book falters for me. Some of the examples are great (he goes into a lot of detail about various Monte Carlo simulations he has constructed), but some just seem like strawmen (he goes to a lot of trouble to describe the fancy cars, extravagant house, impulsive trading strategy, and hubris of a hypothetical trader, setting him up for his inevitable fall at the hands of the ""unexpected rare event"").Some examples are just plain wrong, or at least misleading. For example, he goes into detail describing the work of Karl Popper, a philosopher who was interested in the question ""how do you tell the difference between science and non-science?"" Popper proposed several theories of science to answer this question.The first, naive falsificationism, essentially states two things: firstly, that a theory is scientific if it can be falsified; and secondly, that a theory which has been falsified should no longer be used.The second, sophisticated falsificationism, was a response to both the negativity of naive falsificationism and also a response to the criticism that science doesn't work that way (by immediately discarding theories the moment they contradict any evidence). Sophisticated falsificationism again states two things: that a theory is scientific if it leads to the discovery of novel (ie, new) facts; and that a theory is falsified by a new theory if the new theory can accurately predict everything the old theory could but *also* can accurately predict novel facts. General relativity is the canonical example of this: it incorporates Newtonian mechanics at low speeds but also explains things that Newtonian mechanics cannot at near-light speeds.Anyway, Taleb's summary of all of this was ""Popper's detractors called him a naive falsificationist."" They did not, or at least not disparagingly, because Popper himself proposed the term, and labeled himself accordingly! I can understand why Taleb might not have wanted to include a huge explicative paragraph on Popper, but the book would have been just fine without the dubious example.Another example of sloppiness occurs later, when Taleb talks about the QWERTY keyboard layout as an example of ""the vicious dynamics of winning and losing in an economy"" and repeats the old saw that the QWERTY layout was designed to slow typists down, and that it succeeded anyway because of a ""snowball effect"" of popularity. This claim is highly contentious (in fact one way to both speed typists up and prevent mechanical key jams is to put commonly-used letter combinations on opposite sides of the keyboard, something that QWERTY does to some extent but that Dvorak does much better), and once again the book would have been just fine without it.Taleb is best when he is covering his area of expertise -- probability -- and the chapters dealing with probability are great. There are also several enjoyable and illustrative personal anecdotes which are a fun and memorable read.Overall I enjoyed the book. I just wish he'd put more thought into his examples."
12,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1787047-carolyn-stein,5,"This is the best book I have read all year, closely followed by his other book, The Black Swan. Fooled by Randomness is one of that select group of books that changes your mind entirely. Once I read it I could never look at the world the same again, nor could I take my old assumptions for granted.We are so accustomed to looking at the world and seeing patterns that we do not always understand that we may be seeing randomness and imposing a pattern where none belongs. Taleb talks about the various ways we fool ourselves and why we cannot help but be wrong much of the time. He branches out from probability and mathematics to explain why our minds work as they do and what the recent psychological and neuroscientific studies as well as evolutionary psychology have to say about how we think and why we are so easily fooled by randomness. His writing is lively and peppered with anecdotes. It is an easy read but he never condescends to the reader nor dumbs down the subject. A great read!"
13,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh,2,"The author says right at the beginning in his 20+ page preface that the book is intentionally left unstructured so that it may resemble the flow of his thoughts as and when they popped up. And that I believe is the problem. He seems to go around in circles repeating his ideas and thoughts, coming back to the same points, pulling in unrelated anecdotes while already inside one, leaving thoughts hanging without any form of closure, and generally ensuring you end up doing exactly what he says you shouldn't be doing: making sense of random noise.(view spoiler)[That said, some of his thoughts do seem reward enough for us to do so:* humans are built to see patterns, to find causes for things, and to believe in our own rationality;* some things can't be explained; the human mind can't accept this and seeks some explanation; we can't help doing it* most investment strategies are thus based on what people rationally believe to be the causal equation* having lucky mascots is an example of looking for causality that doesn't exist* we make many decisions emotionally, applying reason with an after-the-fact rationale* we tend to ignore events that have a low probability of occurring* random events occur all the time, yet we don't assign probabilities to or plan for these events* we should also look to learn from those who lost, and not just from the winners - survivorship biasTaleb himself is the founder of a firm that thrives on unexpected events, a strategy he calls ""crisis hunting"" that is diametric to traditional trading companies that notch up steady profits which are wiped out by occasional catastrophic losses. Whether such a practice, if followed by the entire industry, would be useful for, among other things, the economy, is something that he hasn't pondered upon. (hide spoiler)]In all, a decent read, though I thought way too lengthy and cluttered for what he had to say. And the fin-hater in me had to plough through all these pages on investments and trading."
14,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"Again, I'm astounded by the quality of Taleb's writing. His theory is both scientific and poetic, his insights are always useful and reflect what I often experience in my life...the one thing that really impressed me in this book, however, was his ability to tell a great story. That's something I had forgotten about. Before I can truly judge this book, however, I do think I need to read it a second time. Taleb always has sharp provocative ideas, but they do need to be reflected on and digested. Since this is the third book I've read of his and since I've read them in reverse order, I probably don't need a thorough second reading. I would recommend all readers, however, to highlight key passages with a pencil and come back to them periodically to reflect on them.A key lesson that comes out of this book is this, you should always be asking yourself ""How can I not blow up?"" How can I not be an acute successful randomness fool? In other words, how can I not take risks so enormously stupid that I never recover from them? Another key lesson: survivorship bias...we consider rich people successful; however, we do not see the people did the exact same things (took enormous risks) and blew up as a result. We only worship the lucky idiots. And here's a lesson on intellectual humility: ""My lesson from Mr. Soros is to start every meeting at my trading boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Another wonderful book, another wonderful afternoon spent! "

Some people get elated when the find some kind of pattern in randomness, when there is none. Probabilities are misconstrued as certainties. And thus people get fooled by randomness and create theories of success. - This is precisely the belief of Nassim Taleb who goes on and on and on and on to prove it throughout the book. The tone of the book is dismissive and i-am-intelligent-you-are-stupid pedantic. The author lacks clearly the skills of providing an captivating narrative. Talks on finance bore me. Talks on stock market dynamics doubly bore me. The author having spent big part of his life in finance market, gives 100s of examples to prove his theory, but alas all in stock market and finance. The author tries hard to appear very intelligent, which he manages by esoteric references and illustrations. But what is the point in intelligent blabber that confuses the reader. However, there are more than one occasion you will find yourself nodding your head while reading some of the conjectures, especially in the places where the author brings in what you have been always thinking, but rarely talked in the fear of being branded 'jealous' - 'How come that incompetent idiot who can't distinguish between a Picasso and a picture of bull's testicles, is driving a Mercedes, and I am stuck with this Fiat?' with a divine prophecy:Those who were unlucky in life in spite of their skills would eventually rise. The lucky fool might have benefited from some luck in life; over the longer run he would slowly converge to the state of a less-lucky idiot. Each one would revert to his long-term properties. "
16,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1497559-jayaprakash-satyamurthy,3,"I've resisted reading Taleb for reasons he might approve of. I am suspicious of new gurus and of intellectual fads, especially when the word 'market' is factored in. I've finally read this book because a friend whose insights I give some weight to respects Taleb's ideas. What I found is a witty, personable narrative about the dangers of pattern recognition, novelty addiction and overestimating our ability to be rational. Taleb draws on philosophy, mathematics, psychiatry and personal experience and a lifetime of observing a field particularly prone to being tossed on the tides of randomness to cut away many of the assumptions and avowed certainties that are bandied about in business circles. What makes this interesting to me is that Taleb's ideas are relevant beyond the world of trading. This book has things to say about human nature and the good life, and that was more than I expected from a writer I had initially pegged as another prophet of the month for the MBA crowd. "
17,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725471-gordon,4,"This is a book by a trader with an intellectual streak -- although he might say he’s an intellectual with a trading streak. Nassim Taleb's book is highly idiosyncratic and personal, which is both what lends it a lot of its interest and what occasionally makes it irritating. Overall, he does not seem like a likeable man, and in fact is probably proud of that fact. But, it does get kind of tiresome to be told for the 5th or 10th time how unimpressed by wealth he is. In fact, he is clearly impressed by wealth, but counteracts it by stressing how little he works, how much time he devotes to intellectual pursuits and how much smarter he is than the typical wealthy person. But, all that’s just literary style -- and apparently a very popular one, judging by the sales of the book. It remains a fascinating book nonetheless.Key ideas: We do not gauge causation, probability and risk very well, and hence we do not act according to a rational model of behavior, a la homo economicus. His heroes are Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky, whom Taleb sees as the greatest thinkers in modern economics, since they re-wrote the book about how we actually decide as opposed to how economists and other rationalists think we ought to decide. Based on their work and that of a host of other researchers in behavioral economics/finance, he catalogs many of the systematic biases that strongly affect our behavior, such as:o	Hindsight bias: We fit the explanation to the events after the fact, as if we knew it at the time. And, we see patterns where there are none – or we see the wrong pattern. Mistrust the predictions of experts – they will almost always be trumped by an evidence-based analysis, since they tend to mis-remember the past. They remember their successes and forget their failures. o	Attribution bias: Beautiful people are more virtuous than ugly people. Tall people are more likely to be leaders than short people. A man in a suit is more trustworthy than a man in t-shirt and jeans. And so on. o	Small number bias: We extrapolate wildly from small samples.o	Asymmetric pain/pleasure from losses or gains: The pain of a loss is roughly twice as much as the pleasure from an equivalent-sized gain. So we sell our winners but keep our losers (to avoid having to feel the pain).In short, life is more random than you think and your ability to navigate it rationally is more limited than you think. What do I think of all this? He's right that it's a good idea to keep an open mind and to be ready to change your mind when you come up with a better interpretation and/or a more accurate set of facts. So far, so good. But his core world view is the product of the only profession he's ever known: Wall Street trading. As such, he does not shape let alone control events -- he simply bets on their outcome. That's not the kind of perspective that makes you see the world as a highly deterministic place, or one where, if you hope to survive long enough to get a few gray hairs, you can think of yourself as a ""master of the universe"" or even captain of your ship. He doesn't want to be captain of the ship; he just wants to bet on whether the ship will sink in the next storm or not, and turn a profit on the bet."
18,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11269813-kai-schreiber,2,"A nice thesis (humans are unable to correctly assess risk and probability and therefore fall into all kinds of traps) wrapped in pompous and befuddled writing. At times the logic and flow is so jumpy and flawed that I thought there was something wrong with my copy.There is something wrong almost constantly, but the biggest WTF moment came for me, when Taleb, who constantly reminds the reader that everybody else is a fool and it's just him who has insight and the tools to master probability, talks about scientific study of medication and the absence-of-evidence-cliché. It makes him furious that so many of the idiot journalists out there misunderstand absence of evidence for evidence of absence, and he cites studies where despite numerous subjects no significant benefit can be shown for a medication over placebo treatment. This is not evidence that there is no effect of the medication! he yells, and completely fails to understand the difference between significance and effect size. Yes, it may well come out later that the medication indeed does have an effect. But no, it is not at all likely that that effect will be very relevant, as its size must be tiny or the original study methodically flawed (as otherwise it would have found it).To reiterate, Taleb does not distinguish between significance and effect size in an argument where he calls everyone else a fool for not getting probabilities right. Sums up the book quite nicely.(In addition, it is very annoying when his constant reminding the reader that he is no expert on something does not stop him from talking about it, just from giving any evidence for what he is talking about whatsoever. This is mainly true for evolutionary psychology, but threads throughout. ""I'm not a scientist, but a humble trader, so I'll just make shit up now"" does not really work as captatio benevolentiae)."

But, from reading their reports, I think that it paid off. The attitude and tone he takes has a purpose, to deliver a message in three parts: we are not good at dealing with uncertainty, we don't think about uncertainty right because we tend to only see what actually happened instead of considering all the possibilities, and the way to get past this is to consider the process and be assured that it would have handled bad news well. And because of that effectiveness (many of my students stated they never read anything book length voluntarily), the book keeps the readers attention (if the tone does not drive them away!) and is memorable. I have textbooks that I can assign that teaches methods of measuring uncertainty, Fooled by Randomness helped my students learn to think about risk, and that makes it a success in their (and mine) eyes."

Taleb really can't miss a chance to slam Steven Pinker—he really can't stand him! Not quite as bad as the Pinker jabs in Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life however.Amusing, entertaining, and interesting. My 4th Nassim Nicholas Taleb read, looking forward to finishing the Incerto Series with The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable. I read them out of order, but they can each stand on their own. I'll leave you with James Clear's excellent three sentence summary:Randomness, chance, and luck influence our lives and our work more than we realize. Because of hindsight bias and survivorship bias, in particular, we tend to forget the many who fail, remember the few who succeed, and then create reasons and patterns for their success even though it was largely random. Mild success can be explainable by skills and hard work, but wild success is usually attributable to variance and luck."

On one hand, I took away a few things from this book that I think will stay with me for the rest of my life and be very impactful. What more could a book possibly offer?!On the other hand, this book has hardly any focus. I like to think of myself as pretty intelligent -- and I usually get bored quickly -- but even by my standards, Nassim changes topics too quickly. He will cover some theory, like the Law of Large Numbers, as a one sentence commentary in a small anecdote.I've found Nassim to be most helpful in introducing me to new thinkers and ideas, rather than actually explaining his ideas fully.I really liked The Black Swan, because in that book, Nassim really set out to make a point, and the entire book mostly revolved around making that point. And it did.His other books have mostly been a collection of interesting thoughts. It's kind of like listening to someone continuously digress without actually making a point.Still, this man is brilliant, and I haven't yet stopped picking up insights from him. I'll definitely be reading more."

Taleb is a successful trader who has read poetry, history, psychology and many other subjects quite extensively. The result is a book on how randomness guides our lives much more than we want to beliveThe humble message is that we are all fooled by randomness, but few of us know it. Eventually the aim is not to become a cold, rational human calculator (it is simply impossible), but to learn how to live with our humane weaknesses and perhaps every now and then make better decision than other people who have not read books like this one.One of the best books I have ever read."

In this book, Taleb explores the role of randomness in various facets of our lives through a philosophical lens. The fooled-by-randomness problem is the false belief in determinism -- that past events could have only unfolded the way they did. A day trader makes a profit on his latest trade; an up and coming actor gets a role in a movie. While most of us attribute our successes to skill, the author challenges us to reflect on how luck helped shape that success. In a world full of randomness, I see Taleb's message as a grave reminder. We must be radically open-minded, embrace the nonlinearities of life, and reflect on the definitions of success and failure we have set for ourselves."

He is given only a few months to live. Desperate, he travels to Lourdes to pray and drink miraculous water. He heals. He says he was healed by the blessed Virgin Mary. A poor, plain-looking dude like Jack Ma toiled and moiled to make a name for himself and get out of the rut he was in. He succeeded and became one of the richest men in the world. He now tours all over delivering lectures on how to achieve success, preaching its secrets he claim to have discovered. A priest is buried then exhumed several years later and his body had not decomposed. He is sainted. An idiot, with his unique brand of idiocy, captures the imagination of his fellow citizens who are mostly idiots like him anyway. So he wins the elections and, perplexed by his victory, credits the hand of God for it. So he starts to implement his idiotic ideas, reasoning out that since God himself put him into office, then God must have approved of his plans, no matter how unquestionably evil they are.There are many such examples. What is hidden, and which causes the deception, are facts like: MILLIONS as sick as the young man, who drank more holy water than him and prayed even more and visited more holy sites were not healed and had died on schedule; MILLIONS who did what Jack Ma had done and followed what he reveals now as secrets to success, achieved no such success and remained poor or middle class; evil leaders had won elections fair and square, slaughtered millions and caused a lot of sufferings which one can hardly attribute to divine providence; terminally ill agnostics and atheists occasionally enjoying spontaneous healing without praying, drinking miraculous water or going into religious pilgrimages. Fairly recently, a wonderfully preserved body of a long deceased soft porn actress was dug up and no one called her an “incorruptible” like the heart of Padre Pio because she was not known to have lived a holy life when she was still alive.This is, more or less, the main thesis of this book. It unashamedly is—“about luck disguised and perceived as non-luck (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism). It manifests itself in the shape of the LUCKY FOOL, defined as a person who benefited from a disproportionately share of luck but attributes his success to some other, generally very precise, reason. Such confusion crops up in the most unexpected areas, even science, though not in such an accentuated and obvious manner as it does in the world of business. It is endemic in politics, as it can be encountered in the shahpe of a country’s president discoursing on the jobs that HE created, HIS recovery, and “his predecessor’s” inflation.”I like books like this which make you think and question generally-held beliefs. "
27,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73582-tony-cohen,5,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has everything in a book that I yearn for....interesting ideas...some of which I don't grasp because hey are too clever for me...a smug narrator who seemingly knows more than everyone else...and a well-written and pleasing style.Here is the crux of the book. Brokers have a very common weakness. They fail to appreciate that the likelihood of an event can not be the only factor one looks at when deciding to make a move. The likelihood, and the cost of the mistake are both critical.For example. If I told you that you could make $ 100 on every trade for 99/100 times, would you do it? The correct answer, depends on what happens on the other chance. When you are in a market, or some other experience where there are lots of repeated throws of the dice, the rare odd will happen, which is often when you hear of a trader 'blowing up'. When that happens, the greater and powerful ""Master-of-the-Universe"" disappears, and is banished forever...deemed a failure by his peers. What happened, is that he was unaware of the 'Black Swan', the title of another book by the same author.In Europe in the middle ages, because all swans that had been seen were white, it had been postulated that ALL swans were white...a fallacy ultimately disproven when the contrary evidence was eventually found in Australia. In basic logical terms, the absence of B within a data set not proven to be the entire sum does not equal 'always A'.So this 'Black Swan', the one throw out of 100 can and does happen. In the previous example, if you won all the previous 99 throws, you would have earned $9900. That sounds great, until you learn that loosing the final throw costs you $200,000. Knowing those odds, would you play the game? This basic fallacy, the lack of assessing the intensity of the randomness, is what dooms many people who sound well and truly brilliant...right until they blow up and are never heard from again. Of course, there are other brilliant comments on the need to ignore useless and irrelevant noise, and train ourself to recognize that a random fluctuation is just that, and one should not search for a reason for mere statistical chatter, but the analogy of the black swan is the main crux of this wonderfully well-written book. "
28,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91351473-hemanth-kumar,4,"The style of writing is new to me. I was not able to grasp many sections due to my limited knowledge of economics. It is a beautiful Marriage of science and statistics and economics. Author has given interesting examples and point of view on kahnemann and tversky concepts, kind of new perspective. But I plan to read again in the future."
29,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1550603-phillip,1,"The author continually pontificates that random events happen in life. But he neither uses actual events or statistics. He merely invents parables to expound on his points. He continues down this train of thought until he reaches the conclusion that the ultimate success and failure of some people can primarily be explained by luck. The author’s most famous exclamation is that the 40 years of investment success experienced by Warren Buffett, ""may be by chance."" He claims that with the number of investors, it was a statistical certainty that one would obtain Buffett’s success.Obviously, life is full of random events. And some people benefit from occasional windfalls or bonanzas, while others experience tragic accidents. Furthermore, the line between success and failure is often very thin. However, most observant people are able to notice traits that are common to typical people: whether it is successful investors or professional basketball players. Investors may have strong math skills and confidence while professional basketball players may possess incredible athletic ability and be exceptionally tall. People who experience sustained success usually have certain traits (as King Solomon noted over 3,000 years ago. He observed the plans of the diligent led, surely to success, while drunkard and gluttons will come to poverty.) Maybe Nassim Taleb is correct and many successful people are merely lucky and statistical oddities or maybe he is selling a book of excuses."

It is unstructured, repetitive and occasionally polemical- But it worked for me. Not only does it provide a great bibliography ( like someone once said, ""what is the point of a book if it does not lead us to other books"" ) but it also explains a few theories which I knew intuitively but couldn't convince myself that they were more than wishful thoughts. Taleb is probably an idiosyncratic taste, or maybe I just wish that I am able to grasp his theories when others ""less competent"" aren't able to, but I sure will go read his other books. Fortunately, for me, I heard this book over the course of a fortnight while travelling to work and his repetitive forays into breached topics helped me to keep track of the central conceit of his thesis- that of developing an honest skepticism and correlating it with our experience against the handed-down 'wisdom' from an authoritative voice. Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude. Also, surprisingly for a book this cerebral, the ending is really moving."
31,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,4,"A few insights from Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb:•	People often mistake luck and randomness for skill and logic.•	Human brain was not built to make forecasts or think in probabilities.•	Just because it hasn’t happened before, doesn’t mean that it won’t happen any time. •	Emotions can overwhelm any capacity for rational thought.•	Reduce exposure to noise – newspapers, daily stock prices changes, television, etc.•	We are genetically poor at understanding the impact of rare events. One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

He is hilarious in a snide and unexpected way. Richard Feynman wrote ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."" Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance. The second was how we like to give explanations for success in areas also driven by randomness. I loved his distaste of journalists and his suggestions for avoiding news. Great book. Can't wait to read Taleb's other books."

It's also frequently hilarious. I wish this book had existed, and I'd read it, when I was in high school, and if I had the power to do so, I'd make it a required course there now.

36,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
37,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

""No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.""

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
40,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
41,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
42,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
43,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

52,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

The author's tone is obnoxious, but that's hardly a problem if it can be substantiated; I know nothing about the stock market and all that nonsense, but I wouldn't say I learnt anything, because Taleb's overall message is 'yeah man nobody knows anything it's all bullshit but I'm the finance Socrates cause I can pierce the veil.' A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart. So, regarding the business of it all, I must remain with judgment withheld. Surely there must be something better to read than this."

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.I think the book is great.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

It is unstructured, repetitive and occasionally polemical- But it worked for me. Not only does it provide a great bibliography ( like someone once said, ""what is the point of a book if it does not lead us to other books"" ) but it also explains a few theories which I knew intuitively but couldn't convince myself that they were more than wishful thoughts. Taleb is probably an idiosyncratic taste, or maybe I just wish that I am able to grasp his theories when others ""less competent"" aren't able to, but I sure will go read his other books. Fortunately, for me, I heard this book over the course of a fortnight while travelling to work and his repetitive forays into breached topics helped me to keep track of the central conceit of his thesis- that of developing an honest skepticism and correlating it with our experience against the handed-down 'wisdom' from an authoritative voice. Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude.

One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

He is hilarious in a snide and unexpected way. Richard Feynman wrote ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."" Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance. The second was how we like to give explanations for success in areas also driven by randomness. I loved his distaste of journalists and his suggestions for avoiding news. Great book. Can't wait to read Taleb's other books."

66,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
67,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
70,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
71,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
72,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "

So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

Reading Taleb is like listening to a really smart friend talk about the world. He covers so many subjects and has very provocative ideas. He will challenge you. He will make you question your life success and failures. Its a good thing to do."
82,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart.

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.I think the book is great.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

Fortunately, for me, I heard this book over the course of a fortnight while travelling to work and his repetitive forays into breached topics helped me to keep track of the central conceit of his thesis- that of developing an honest skepticism and correlating it with our experience against the handed-down 'wisdom' from an authoritative voice. Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude.

One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways.

96,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "

First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

""No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.""

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
100,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
101,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
102,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
103,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

112,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart.

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude. Also, surprisingly for a book this cerebral, the ending is really moving."
121,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,4,"A few insights from Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb:•	People often mistake luck and randomness for skill and logic.•	Human brain was not built to make forecasts or think in probabilities.•	Just because it hasn’t happened before, doesn’t mean that it won’t happen any time. •	Emotions can overwhelm any capacity for rational thought.•	Reduce exposure to noise – newspapers, daily stock prices changes, television, etc.•	We are genetically poor at understanding the impact of rare events. One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

122,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59833287-erik-rostad,5,"I loved this book. In the afterword, Nassim Taleb writes that he meant for the book to be playful. It was. He is hilarious in a snide and unexpected way. Richard Feynman wrote ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."" Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance. The second was how we like to give explanations for success in areas also driven by randomness. I loved his distaste of journalists and his suggestions for avoiding news. Great book. Can't wait to read Taleb's other books."
123,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james,5,"I love this book. It's like a course in critical thinking and the use of the scientific method to make important decisions instead of falling into a number of errors of logic that seem to be the defaults for the human mind throughout history. It's also frequently hilarious. I wish this book had existed, and I'd read it, when I was in high school, and if I had the power to do so, I'd make it a required course there now. Of course, that would never fly, given that it would equip people to see through the nonsense foisted on us by politicians, pundits, and advertisers."

126,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
127,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

""No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.""

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
130,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
131,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
132,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
133,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me. Although some of them were funny:""He just has a rulebook and, over a career spanning forty to forty-five years, he will just stamp documents, be mildly rude, and go home to drink nonpasteurized beer and watch soccer games.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

We see patterns where they don't really exist and we have an over tendancy to see causation where it isn't (aka ""hind-sight"" / ""survivor"" bias). Put another way, our brains are ill equipped to handle probability and decision making in uncertainty. We tend to believe stupid things and make poor decisions because of these deficiencies. It takes a lot of extra work to overcome our own propensities toward silliness. "

If you take 10000 people and let them flip coins 20 of them will get the same side 10 times in a row. I'm a big fan of most of Taleb's work so take this with a grain of salt.
141,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20174993-bett-correa-bollhoefer,5,"This was the only book my Taleb I hadn't read yet, but I finally got around to it. I really enjoyed it. Reading Taleb is like listening to a really smart friend talk about the world. He covers so many subjects and has very provocative ideas. He will challenge you. He will make you question your life success and failures. Its a good thing to do."
142,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

The author's tone is obnoxious, but that's hardly a problem if it can be substantiated; I know nothing about the stock market and all that nonsense, but I wouldn't say I learnt anything, because Taleb's overall message is 'yeah man nobody knows anything it's all bullshit but I'm the finance Socrates cause I can pierce the veil.' A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart. So, regarding the business of it all, I must remain with judgment withheld. Surely there must be something better to read than this."

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.I think the book is great.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

Taleb is probably an idiosyncratic taste, or maybe I just wish that I am able to grasp his theories when others ""less competent"" aren't able to, but I sure will go read his other books. Fortunately, for me, I heard this book over the course of a fortnight while travelling to work and his repetitive forays into breached topics helped me to keep track of the central conceit of his thesis- that of developing an honest skepticism and correlating it with our experience against the handed-down 'wisdom' from an authoritative voice. Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude.

One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance. The second was how we like to give explanations for success in areas also driven by randomness. I loved his distaste of journalists and his suggestions for avoiding news. Great book.

156,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
157,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

160,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
161,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."

He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
163,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me. Although some of them were funny:""He just has a rulebook and, over a career spanning forty to forty-five years, he will just stamp documents, be mildly rude, and go home to drink nonpasteurized beer and watch soccer games.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

Reading Taleb is like listening to a really smart friend talk about the world. He covers so many subjects and has very provocative ideas. He will challenge you. He will make you question your life success and failures. Its a good thing to do."
172,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart. So, regarding the business of it all, I must remain with judgment withheld. Surely there must be something better to read than this."

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

He is hilarious in a snide and unexpected way. Richard Feynman wrote ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."" Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance.

186,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
187,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

""No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.""

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
190,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
191,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
192,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
193,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

202,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

The author's tone is obnoxious, but that's hardly a problem if it can be substantiated; I know nothing about the stock market and all that nonsense, but I wouldn't say I learnt anything, because Taleb's overall message is 'yeah man nobody knows anything it's all bullshit but I'm the finance Socrates cause I can pierce the veil.' A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart. So, regarding the business of it all, I must remain with judgment withheld. Surely there must be something better to read than this."

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.I think the book is great.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

It is unstructured, repetitive and occasionally polemical- But it worked for me. Not only does it provide a great bibliography ( like someone once said, ""what is the point of a book if it does not lead us to other books"" ) but it also explains a few theories which I knew intuitively but couldn't convince myself that they were more than wishful thoughts. Taleb is probably an idiosyncratic taste, or maybe I just wish that I am able to grasp his theories when others ""less competent"" aren't able to, but I sure will go read his other books. Fortunately, for me, I heard this book over the course of a fortnight while travelling to work and his repetitive forays into breached topics helped me to keep track of the central conceit of his thesis- that of developing an honest skepticism and correlating it with our experience against the handed-down 'wisdom' from an authoritative voice. Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude.

211,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,4,"A few insights from Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb:•	People often mistake luck and randomness for skill and logic.•	Human brain was not built to make forecasts or think in probabilities.•	Just because it hasn’t happened before, doesn’t mean that it won’t happen any time. •	Emotions can overwhelm any capacity for rational thought.•	Reduce exposure to noise – newspapers, daily stock prices changes, television, etc.•	We are genetically poor at understanding the impact of rare events. One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

He is hilarious in a snide and unexpected way. Richard Feynman wrote ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."" Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance. The second was how we like to give explanations for success in areas also driven by randomness. I loved his distaste of journalists and his suggestions for avoiding news. Great book. Can't wait to read Taleb's other books."

216,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
217,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

""No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.""

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
220,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
221,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
222,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
223,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me. Although some of them were funny:""He just has a rulebook and, over a career spanning forty to forty-five years, he will just stamp documents, be mildly rude, and go home to drink nonpasteurized beer and watch soccer games.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

In all that noise you quickly loose track. Don’t bother to go back and try to figure it out. Only a few pages later a completely unrelated new topic starts and the current one will end without anything more than the conclusion that the others did it wrong.

Reading Taleb is like listening to a really smart friend talk about the world. He covers so many subjects and has very provocative ideas. He will challenge you. He will make you question your life success and failures. Its a good thing to do."
232,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

The author's tone is obnoxious, but that's hardly a problem if it can be substantiated; I know nothing about the stock market and all that nonsense, but I wouldn't say I learnt anything, because Taleb's overall message is 'yeah man nobody knows anything it's all bullshit but I'm the finance Socrates cause I can pierce the veil.' A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart. So, regarding the business of it all, I must remain with judgment withheld. Surely there must be something better to read than this."

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.I think the book is great.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

Taleb is probably an idiosyncratic taste, or maybe I just wish that I am able to grasp his theories when others ""less competent"" aren't able to, but I sure will go read his other books. Fortunately, for me, I heard this book over the course of a fortnight while travelling to work and his repetitive forays into breached topics helped me to keep track of the central conceit of his thesis- that of developing an honest skepticism and correlating it with our experience against the handed-down 'wisdom' from an authoritative voice. Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude.

One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

He is hilarious in a snide and unexpected way. Richard Feynman wrote ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."" Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance. The second was how we like to give explanations for success in areas also driven by randomness. I loved his distaste of journalists and his suggestions for avoiding news. Great book.

246,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
247,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

""No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.""

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
250,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
251,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
252,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
253,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me. Although some of them were funny:""He just has a rulebook and, over a career spanning forty to forty-five years, he will just stamp documents, be mildly rude, and go home to drink nonpasteurized beer and watch soccer games.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

In all that noise you quickly loose track. Don’t bother to go back and try to figure it out. Only a few pages later a completely unrelated new topic starts and the current one will end without anything more than the conclusion that the others did it wrong.

262,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "

A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart.

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.I think the book is great.

Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.

270,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20312923-sirish,5,"A skeptic's guide to life - A lot of what its critics say about this book is true. It is unstructured, repetitive and occasionally polemical- But it worked for me. Not only does it provide a great bibliography ( like someone once said, ""what is the point of a book if it does not lead us to other books"" ) but it also explains a few theories which I knew intuitively but couldn't convince myself that they were more than wishful thoughts. Taleb is probably an idiosyncratic taste, or maybe I just wish that I am able to grasp his theories when others ""less competent"" aren't able to, but I sure will go read his other books. Fortunately, for me, I heard this book over the course of a fortnight while travelling to work and his repetitive forays into breached topics helped me to keep track of the central conceit of his thesis- that of developing an honest skepticism and correlating it with our experience against the handed-down 'wisdom' from an authoritative voice. Most of all, I seem to have taken a liking towards the man because he seems honourable; The kind who practices what he preaches. His talk of people's confidence in the face of randomness ( how can we be so sure of our past thoughts and analyses when we don't even know where our thoughts come from and what the next thought would be ) stuck a chord with me probably because it was within my acceptance latitude. Also, surprisingly for a book this cerebral, the ending is really moving."
271,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,4,"A few insights from Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb:•	People often mistake luck and randomness for skill and logic.•	Human brain was not built to make forecasts or think in probabilities.•	Just because it hasn’t happened before, doesn’t mean that it won’t happen any time. •	Emotions can overwhelm any capacity for rational thought.•	Reduce exposure to noise – newspapers, daily stock prices changes, television, etc.•	We are genetically poor at understanding the impact of rare events. One black swan makes the long held belief that all swans are white incorrect.•	In the long run, successful fools will run out of luck and after many years of success they will have one disastrous quarter where they lose everything.•	The past blowups were always surprises, as all future ones will also be. •	Path dependent outcome – things sometimes end up as they are because of luck or randomness, not because it makes sense.•	People get attached to their ideas, but we should learn to change our minds when presented with solid evidence.•	The more enduring trading strategy is betting on rare or unlikely events with a big payoff in case they occur.

272,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59833287-erik-rostad,5,"I loved this book. In the afterword, Nassim Taleb writes that he meant for the book to be playful. It was. He is hilarious in a snide and unexpected way. Richard Feynman wrote ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."" Fooled by Randomness shows how we are often fooled in a variety of ways. Two that stuck out to me were how we tend to praise people who are successful in fields that are largely driven by randomness and chance. The second was how we like to give explanations for success in areas also driven by randomness. I loved his distaste of journalists and his suggestions for avoiding news. Great book. Can't wait to read Taleb's other books."

It's also frequently hilarious. I wish this book had existed, and I'd read it, when I was in high school, and if I had the power to do so, I'd make it a required course there now.

276,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"Interesting content, horrible writing. Early in the book, Taleb mentions that he ignored most of the feedback from his editors; the result is a book that's poorly organized, has awkward sentence structure, seems to wander randomly (haha) from topic to topic, and uses a voice that is *horribly* smug. Taleb insults every ""expert"" everywhere—especially investors, MBAs, editors, and journalists—and is all too happy to tell you how everyone is an idiot and wrong about just about everything. It's off-putting and made me want to put the book down many times.The only things that kept me going were (a) that I had read many rave reviews about this book and (b) I was able, after much skimming to get past the obnoxious attitude, to find a few interesting insights here and there. Some of the main ones:* The key argument of the book is that far more of life (but not all!) is attributable to random chance than we normally assume. It's human nature to come up with elaborate stories of causality and hero narratives, but this is largely due to a variety of cognitive biases, especially hindsight bias and survivorship bias. * Given a large stream of data (e.g., stock data), the shorter the time scale you use when looking at the data, the more noise you'll find. For example, the more often you check your financial portfolio, the more likely that the up and down moves you observe are purely random, rather than any meaningful pattern. Over longer time periods, the fluctuations tend to cancel out and the real patterns emerge (law of large numbers). * The larger the pool of candidates, the more likely it is that the success of some of those candidates is due to pure randomness. For example, if you have 10 people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average (especially over a longer time period, as from the previous point), then it's likely due to that person's skill. But if you have 10 million people trading stocks, and one does significantly better than the average, then that is much more likely due to dumb luck. * In fact, you can model this: start with 10 million people and have 5 million randomly pick one stock position and the other 5 million pick the opposite position. After a few weeks, one of these groups will have made money and the other will have lost money. Take the group that made money, and now have 2.5 million of them randomly pick another stock position and the other 2.5 million pick the opposite position. Keep repeating this experiment, each time taking the group that made money and sub-dividing them, and after 10 repetitions, you'll have roughly 10,000 people who made correct stock picks 10 times in a row—and made loads of money—through pure randomness.* Based on the two items above, it's worth noting that the most successful traders in any (relatively short) time period are often the *worst* traders! They are the ones with no understanding of what they are doing, who just happen to blunder into success through pure random chance. However, over multiple cycles, their luck will run out, and they will also be the ones to ""blow up"" in the most spectacular fashion.* We are used to systems where more information means more certainty about your knowledge: e.g., if you're picking marbles out of a jar, each new marble you get increases your confidence in knowing the distribution of colors in that jar. However, there are many systems in life where this isn't the case: e.g., perhaps the marbles are not evenly distributed (e.g., all the red marbles are at the top, all the blue at the bottom) or, worse yet, perhaps a mischievous actor is sneaking marbles into the jar when you look away (e.g., after you took out 100 red, they dump in 100 blue). * Probability is not same as expected value, though most people confuse the two. Having a low probability of losing money is good, but if that loss ends up being catastrophic, then the expected value is still going to be very low, and may be worth avoiding. * Real life is like the infinite monkeys at infinite type writers idea, except we only see the monkeys that (randomly) produced Shakespeare and not the countless more who failed to do so. E.g., We typically only see the successful professional athletes on TV and not the vastly larger number of athletes that never made it. Since we typically only see the winners, we vastly miscalculate the odds of success and misunderstand what it really takes to be successful (e.g., we may notice all professional athletes have coaches and assume that's what it takes to be successful, not realizing that all the athletes who never made it to the pros may have also had coaches). * The cycle of life: you start off poor, then you get rich, then you move to a more affluent neighborhood, and now you're poor again. * True randomness does not look random to us. Consider dart board with 16 squares. If you threw 16 darts completely at random, the odds of getting 1 dart in each square is very, very low. Instead, it's much more likely that some squares will have several darts while others have no darts. This sort of ""clustering"" is totally normal in random data, whereas uniform distributions are exceptionally rare.* Much of life is the result of ""path dependance:"" that is, where we get a result not due to its merits or some logical decision, but merely as the next step from some previous result. For example, we use the QWERTY keyboard layout on almost all computers not because it's the most efficient, but because it's one of the least efficient! This is due to path dependence, where old mechanical typewriters used to jam if you typed to fast, and the QWERTY layout was developed to reduce typing speed. It stuck, and due to the way history developed, it's nearly impossible to change it now, even though better layouts exist.* Random effects are like compound interest: a small random win early on lead can lead to a disproportionately huge advantage later on. This is largely due to path dependence. For example, consider two children, Bob and Steve, who both take up hockey at age 8. Let's say before their first game, Bob happened to have a great night of sleep, while Steve slept poorly. As a result, Bob plays great, whereas Steve has a lackluster performance. Going into the second game, Bob is now feeling confident, and plays well again, whereas Steve feels outmatched, and plays poorly again. After a year or two of this self-reinforcing loop, Bob may end up being picked for the ""A"" team at school, whereas Steve get stuck on the ""B"" team. The A team is seen as the more hopeful candidates, so they get more practice time, better coaches, and stronger opponents than the B team, so gap in skill between Bob and Steve will increase further. Over a number of years, this will compound further and further to where Bob may end up going to the pros, whereas Steve gets cut from the team in high school—all due to a totally random occurrence very early on.Having read all this, and found some of it interesting, it's not clear what we're supposed to do with it. Yes, there is a lot of randomness in the world, and yes, we're all largely blind to it based on how the human brain evolved. But so what? Calling everyone an idiot and throwing away all the tools and techniques we use today doesn't seem like a good solution (I'm reminded of the quote, ""All models are wrong; some models are useful""). I suppose the main contribution of this book is increase awareness of randomness, which is definitely a worthwhile activity, but I would've liked to see more concrete advice from Taleb on how to better deal with it (beyond the 2-3 ""tricks"" he mentions in te final chapter). As always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes from the book:“Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. Second, unlike a well-defined precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. One is capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette - and calling it by some alternative “low risk” game.” “My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.” “There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (economists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect). Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy conditions in the art market, it is now worth $40,000. If you owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price? If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate—only an emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates.” "
277,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is one of the few people who have benefited from the current economic crisis. The reasons are twofold. First, he has an investment strategy which results in him losing small amounts of money usually, but making a killing on large changes, and most of the large, rapid changes which happen in the markets are negative.Second, and perhaps more relevant here, is that in a book in 2006 called The Black Swan, he more or less predicted the whole mess. Most famously, he said that Fannie Mae was sitting on a barrel of dynamite, but more generally he said that the risk management models which were then currently used were fundamentally flawed, and vulnerable to a general downturn (which is in the long run inevitable).Black Swan was his second book, however. In 2004, Taleb had published a book which, while hailed by Malcolm Gladwell as being ""to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther's 95 theses were to the Catholic Church"", did not get nearly the notice (though it did well for a first book).Here, in a nutshell, is the essence of his book (paraphrased). 1000 new traders enter the stock market (or become risk management professionals, or whatever). They try all kinds of things, based on their personalities and personal history and so on. After one year, 500 of them performed better than the median. After two years, 250 of them have done so two years in a row, etc. etc., until after five years just over 30 of them have beaten the median five years in a row.So far, so what. However, at this point, a few things happen. One is that people don't like to believe things are random (unless they're losing). So, these 30 stars start to get interviews, write articles on their investment strategies (subtext: I'm rich because I'm smarter than you), and thus get imitated. The 30 or so guys who have lost five years in a row, despite being no less smart, are forced out of the business; no one will trust them with their money.Now these 30 lucky guys all think it's not luck, because probably they did have some strategy. It's just that their strategy wasn't a priori a good one; the fact that it gave them the right answers was a matter of luck. If all 1000 traders, with the same abilities and strategies, had started in a different decade, it might be a different 30 who were the star performers (maybe even some of the same 30 who in fact ended up being losers 5 years in a row instead).So, the market will tend to get filled with investors who all use one of a few strategies, trying to imitate one of their heroes. After 10 years, there's probably only 1 or 2 of those original 1000 who have been winners every year, plus a few who have been winners 8 or 9 years out of 10. There were even 1 or 2 of the 30 who were stars after five years, who are now five-in-a-row losers.Why does any of this matter?It matters for these reasons:1) we tend to act as if these people earned their money, more than a person who won the lottery, and thus we listen to their opinions on things like how to run the economy2) we tend to give these people bigger and bigger chunks of the economy (i.e. bigger and bigger amounts of $$), and they have not in fact got any more ability. If they were only controlling their own winnings, this might be ok, but in reality they end up controlling many orders of magnitude more money than others of equal or even superior talentThe most frequent criticism lobbed at Taleb is: so what can we do about it? We have to do something. The best answer would be, I think, that we DON'T have to act as if those who have been lucky in the past know more about the economy than we do, until and unless they have success not explainable by random probability (taking into account how many people try to become Warren Buffett, before deciding whether or not he is better than the average investor or if his winnings can be explained by chance).We also want to be suspicious of strategies which involve picking winners. Investing in many different ways, with a small stake on each, is less prone to risk than picking a few investments which a guru has recommended, and loading up on them. Even better is to assume most of your investments will NOT work, and only pick ones where the potential payoff is worth the high risk of losing (the lottery, by the way, would not qualify, as the payoff multiplier is much less than the risk of losing). Music labels and book publishers try to pick winners and push them heavily; Ebay and Amazon try to build a scheme where it doesn't lose much (if anything) on losers, and let everyone put their wares out for sale.Having said all this, is Taleb's book any good? Yes, if. If you don't mind reading the work of a man for whom all people are either idiots, frauds, or (occasionally) geniuses, depending on whether they understand the principle he's most concerned with, then he's very entertaining. His historical examples are well told, and his logic is on the whole sound. Plus, just now, it is hard to disagree with someone who says that investment bankers and risk managers are mostly hucksters who don't deserve their salaries, much less their bonuses.Randomness is easy to get fooled by, mostly because we want to feel in control of our lives, and don't want to imagine ourselves buffeted about by random forces we cannot predict. There is nothing harder to explain to people than something they don't want to be true. Anyone who can write about it in an engaging and insightful way, is a rarity; Taleb's books are a rare treat."

""No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word.""

You'll be fooled by this book! Who named this book 'one of the smartest books of all time'! Maybe they were fooled by randomness. The author has overestimated the omnipotence of 'Randomness' in everything negating the value of planning and preparation. I went into this book seeking to be enlightened and came back out depressed."
280,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,5,"In his witty, informative, sober yet often ludicrous and sarcastic tone, Taleb expounds on the simple yet unsolvable problem of inference. This problem is as old as Solon at least, who already warned against the human tendency to infer from little empirical evidence rules and predictions expected to apply in general context, especially in the future. The echo of Solon's warning comes across the book and is embodied by Popper's (naive, as some say) falsificationism and his suggestion not to take science too seriously, as it may be erecting buildings on fragile fundations, to be continuously subjected to revisions or rejections. Popper had embodied Solon's call also in politics and socioeconomics with his vision of the open society, where tolerance of alternative or even competitive views is fundamental to avoid errors and be able to face sudden changes. Taleb observes that monotheisms may have a large part in the difficulty to establish a truly open society, as they foster the idea of infallibilism, monism and of absolute truth. This tendency was in fact new to the Mediterranean area where they arose, and were not totally successful in silencing the competitive attitudes, particularly stoicism, to which Taleb tributes an explicit apology toward the end, though his appreciation of Montaigne, Carneades and Zeno are evident throughout. In earnest, Taleb admits that he himself is no better than anyone else in not being fooled by randomness, but his advantage is that he is aware of that (he is a specialist in risk trading, and it is interesting to note that though the book was published in 2004, he was still able to made a large fortune in recent years using the tools he exposes. This is consistent with his claim that people can be said of how to behave for very short time (when they may even agree with the suggestions), but then revert to their innate habits; and he also state his personal paradox, for which he gains because other do not apply what he is explaining).Being a personal essay and not a treatise, Taleb is free from formal pressure yet conveys many concepts clearly and wittingly. He presents the results of Kahneman and Tversky at the base of behavioral finance, evolutionary psychology and brain modularity to try to explain why we may just be hardwired to be fooled by noise and not be able to behave according to our rational grasp of probabilities, as we are emotional beings - being emotional is fundamental, but has its downsides which need to be constrained, that is.Taleb assaults MBAs and professional traders for their apparent success based according to him more on luck than skill. He comments on the way data are easy to fit post factum, so stories to justify success are easy to accomodate though they may just be fiction. He supports the idea that heroism is to be judged on actions, not on their results - just the opposite of what historians normally do.The text is laden with Latin and Greek citations, which make a nice contrast to the Wall Street kind of setting of the action. His disgust for people compulsively checking news, fluctuations of prices and making judgments on easy to be scooped biases (hindsight, survivorship, anchoring, availability, endowement, and so on) is just lovely, admitted that he himself if occasionally the object of the attack, except for when that is tolerated for aestetic purposes.Very refreshing, intriguing, against the grain and smart. A must read."
281,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"A scattershot and snarky schooling in statistical concepts like random variation and expected values, disguised as a sort of philosophical musing on life working in financial markets. Humans are all flawed and crammed with biases, and this affects how we see the world much more than cold, dispassionate logic. One of Taleb's favorites is survivorship bias, highly relevant in the business world. They only write articles in Forbes about the survivors, the traders on fantastic hot streaks or entrepreneurs whose startups are blowing up. But these survivors are way, way more likely to have been lucky than good (*someone* has to come out on top), and as such, that luck can dissipate at any time. It often arrives in the form of a ""black swan,"" that rare worst case scenario that no one thought could happen until it did. Everyone thinks they're skilled geniuses on the way up, but victims of cruel circumstance on the way down.Aside from my hopefully-safe work IRAs, I don't play the market, because I am smart enough to know that I definitely wouldn't know what I was doing. But I do a lot of low- or no-stakes fantasy sports and pools, and the same lessons apply. I stopped doing March Madness pools some years ago because I thought too much about the math. Making predictions when everyone has more or less the same data is silly. It is ludicrous to pick underdogs, but if everyone picks favorites, everyone will tie. So everyone looks for “good” underdogs (or just picks their alma mater or who has the best mascot), the ones that might shake things up, and you hope your particular combination of shaking things up will be the one that happens. But you have no idea, and are deluding yourself if you do. The very large pool winners like on ESPN and such generally have insane strategies. Essentially you need to introduce variance, and the right kind of variance that particular year. You will probably always lose, but you are also a candidate to win, unlike all the chalky brackets.This is the kind of stuff I think a lot about, so I found a long read on it interesting and enjoyable, though Taleb's attitude and writing style is both a help and hindrance. He has found some brilliant ways of explaining some of these concepts, and can devilishly funny (e.g., he takes a lot of good digs at MBAs, which he feels is his right as someone who has one). But he can also come across as disdainful and arrogant, and the writing is hit and miss. It's a good book to read and think on casually, more than a tight, cohesive page-turner. He repeats himself a lot and tries out a lot of metaphors for the same few concepts, so it could've been maybe half as long. He also frequently starts down various theoretical roads only to peter out without solidifying any real point. Like he put every shower thought he had to paper while he was writing the book, but frequently didn’t go back to develop much of it. (I was already thinking that before I got to the end chapter literally called ""Three Afterthoughts in the Shower."")P.S. Discussion of Herbert Simon and his concept of “satisficing” brought me hard back to library school."
282,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"My next reading project for this year is the entirety of Nassim Taleb's Incerto series on the role of chance, randomness, and reexaminations of the way we think about business, markets, and day to day life outside of the trader's world.First of all, Taleb is a fantastic writer. He keeps the pace going well, keeps his prose free of tedious and unnecessary outside references or overly flowery language, and most importantly, what he has to say is important and provocative, all the while being very convincingly told.This first volume (not necessary to read them in order), deals with the unseen role of chance and randomness in markets and business and the various ways in which we frequently blind ourselves to these occurrences due to the central human arrogance to always want to seem like you know more than you do and are expert on things which you can't really be an expert, but also the subconscious thought processes and heuristics that allow such self-delusion. The focus here is on the world of economics and mainly traders so I had to do a bit of homework in the area to understand a lot of the terminology used, however, for the most part this book remains accessible to the lay reader. While this subject of randomness has been discussed in the worlds of physics and mathematics (including a wonderful recent book by Leonard Mlodinow), this is a one of a kind book that cause quite a stir and generated an almost cult following for the author which he capitalized on in the next book the series, Black Swan (my next reading project). This is engaging reading that does at times get into the dense world of economics so be sure to take your time with it. "
283,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/838635-ralph-palm,1,"Interesting idea badly executed. So badly, in fact, I was left wondering who it was written for; it was neither coherent enough for an academic audience nor clear enough for a general one. The book is suffused with trivial errors of fact and usage, to the point where no statement (trivial or otherwise) retains any credibility. It is filled with the most glaring contradictions: the author will condemn an act on one page and commit it on the next, without any appreciable shred of self-awareness. This bizarrely paradoxical presentation is further exacerbated by the author's own explicit claims to possess the very self-awareness which is no where in evidence. Lastly, I should note that this is a claim about the text, not the author. He may very well be a genius-wizard of the highest of high orders. Whether this is or is not the case, this book conceals it very well. His fans, however, are demonstrably fools. They admire the book based not on its contents, but on the author's own financial successes, while the book itself makes precisely the opposite point--that admiring people who happen to be successful without regard to their underlying thinking is itself foolish.Ug, business majors....

Some self-aggrandizement is fine given his job but the book is also full of cheap digs at his colleagues and since I don't really know the author or his friends it's all lost on me. The book starts out with a disclaimer that it will not attempt science or reason (research is hard!) because it's more about anecdotes and gut feelings and then continues to point and laugh at all those pseudo-science done by other traders.The contempt for people earning less money was also off-putting. I got so used to the praise of people who make and do things as valuable to society in books that touch on economical issues that this view of the world actually managed to shock me. Although some of them were funny:""He just has a rulebook and, over a career spanning forty to forty-five years, he will just stamp documents, be mildly rude, and go home to drink nonpasteurized beer and watch soccer games.

Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes. Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."

And the strength it takes to complete it.A piece of extreme cynicism, which well, is absolutely required in certain spheres like the stock markets and gambling, but goes too far in making localized analogies in others. An honest account of the existence of randomness and a detailed effort to put forth the ideas. Although their utility for us, beyond leaving everything to chance, is not much.To believers of luck: Must read, for you will be elated beyond your imagination, feel good about yourself, and would be satisfied for you made a 'statistically' successful life. No offence Intended.To non believers: Read. Doubt yourself for a long time, reevaluate your beliefs. If you were profound in your earlier belief, you will come back stronger.For its not the random things that happen to us, but the deterministic way we react to them, that makes the difference."
287,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26287713-johnny,1,Beside some good points and examples this book has not much more to offer than a long list of anecdotes on how other people act on the wrong premises. What it lacks is facts and a coherent idea that shows how you can prevent doing the same mistakes. Taleb talks endlessly about risk but don’t bother with an explanation on how to act on that. In all that noise you quickly loose track. Don’t bother to go back and try to figure it out. Only a few pages later a completely unrelated new topic starts and the current one will end without anything more than the conclusion that the others did it wrong.

Despite this books flaws--the sometimes haughty narrator, the repetitiveness, and the occasional extremism, I found this book fascinating. It also lends itself to much bigger questions surrounding the determinism of life."
289,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2494540-colin-bendell,4,"The bottom line is that our brains are really hyper active pattern matchers. We see patterns where they don't really exist and we have an over tendancy to see causation where it isn't (aka ""hind-sight"" / ""survivor"" bias). Put another way, our brains are ill equipped to handle probability and decision making in uncertainty. We tend to believe stupid things and make poor decisions because of these deficiencies. It takes a lot of extra work to overcome our own propensities toward silliness. "
290,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6309866-priit,5,Luck and randomness play a huge part in our lives. A no nonsense overview of probability and our inability to grasp it in our thinking. If you take 10000 people and let them flip coins 20 of them will get the same side 10 times in a row. I'm a big fan of most of Taleb's work so take this with a grain of salt.
291,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20174993-bett-correa-bollhoefer,5,"This was the only book my Taleb I hadn't read yet, but I finally got around to it. I really enjoyed it. Reading Taleb is like listening to a really smart friend talk about the world. He covers so many subjects and has very provocative ideas. He will challenge you. He will make you question your life success and failures. Its a good thing to do."
292,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12083674-michael-david,5,"People hate to be called out on their strengths, and Taleb does just that. He's not as nice as Daniel Kahneman, so he may come off as offensive to people who think they have above average intelligence, like me.Most of what he wrote about, however, is salient. Taleb founds his book on Solon's insight regarding happiness: ""The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has guaranteed continued happiness until the end we may call happy.""It's a somber introduction, and one that will color the entire book. The book is undeniably cynical, but it's like an astringent that will wake one up from his intellectual stupor. One fundamental concept that Taleb introduces is the nature of alternative histories, or the probabilities of the unseen. Kahneman established in Thinking, Fast and Slow that ""what you see is all there is,"" and this was restated by Taleb: we need to be vigilant to take into account things that did not happen as well, because if we based our decisions on what we merely perceive, we tend to fail to account the rare events (or the black swan). To perceive of life as probabilistic is quite difficult, and does not come natural to humans. I read TFAS before I read this book, so I recognize a lot of the cognitive biases that Taleb expounds upon. For example, ""people often confuse complex ideas that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symptomatic of a confused mind."" This is also a heuristic that plagues most people, because they have a hard time dealing with cognitive strain. Many ideas in this book have been better expanded in a nicer language by Kahneman in his text. However, the idea of ergodicity was novel. Because Taleb is a philosopher of probability, he used one of its concepts to refer to history. In ergodicity, ""very long sample paths would end up resembling each other."" History is potent enough to deliver most of the possible scenarios and to eventually bury the bad guy. It is also ergodicity that has led Taleb to recognize the dualistic nature of man when it comes to luck: ""Nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.""The COVID-19 disease, for example, shares a lot of common properties with the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. That pandemic lasted for almost three years, and the nature of the virulent strain of influenza approximates the SARS-CoV-2 virus's effect. Taleb advises caution against the effects of randomness. For example, many doctors ignore the ill effects of sleeplessness and obesity, because a lot seem to disconnect themselves from the probability that they may be afflicted with the disorders they study. This thinking affects most people, including me: critical thinking is often absent with ""definitive facts"" in medicine, and yet it must be recognized by most that science is constantly evolving and transforming itself. Although I wish to be staid with my values and morals, Taleb encourages people to be dynamic in their thinking. This means to correct their mistaken perceptions with appropriate data, and then move forward. I think this is also intellectual humility. He essays Karl Popper's ideas that science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. Theories are either wrong, or are yet to be proven wrong. He's not a very positive writer. He later discusses the  survivorship bias, or the bias that people have against luck. In trading, which was Taleb's profession, those who got rich from the volatile stock market were simply luckier than their counterparts. Their predictions were often little better than chance, and it wasn't talent but rather luck that kept them afloat. He emphasizes that luck has a large part in life, which is indeed true. One's luck begins when one is formed in his or her mother's womb. If I had been born to a squatter without proper work, I wouldn't be as competent in English as I am now. Further, ""volatility actually helps bad investment decisions.""He continues with luck permeating our daily lives: ""chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority - not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise.""Taleb proceeds to question the potency of our minds. Herbert Simon believed that ""if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost us an infinite amount of time and energy."" He offers a solution, which is satisficing: stop when one gets a near-satisfactory solution. To me it's a relevant part of the book, because I was among those guys who got trapped in analysis paralysis. It's a good thing I've worked in the ER for a few years, where imperfect but satisfactory solutions to problematic emergent patients have to be arrived at quickly, or the patient dies. Before, I also thought that I should make decisions without emotions. However, Antonio Damasio pointed out that emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Reality is much more complicated than any possible model, and even with our brain, a long time would be spent simply to decide on the simplest of tasks. Among his final lessons is that ""we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it."" Through an undertone of skepticism, Taleb debunks most people's beliefs that they are the center of the universe. He offers no easy answers, because he suggests against heuristics. I think, however, that knowing we are idiots provides us with more than enough spark to address our intellectual hubris. In spite of his acerbic tone, Taleb advises intellectual humility, which is necessary in this day and age. "
293,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8702542-kirk,5,NNT sure knows how to think. I would argue he is one of the foremost thinkers of our time. He writes profoundly and with finesse. This is definitely one I will have to re-read multiple times coupled with discussions with other readers. Love this and would recommend it to others. 
294,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44512541-steve-hind,5,"This book changed how I think about the world. Most specifically in how I think about success in investing, but in general it makes a strong argument for thinking about success differently in general. It's breezily written and entertaining."
295,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,Very interesting theory. I have thought about this book many times since I have read it. Especially during this current economic crisis. 
296,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2170150-sheng-peng,5,"A Great Read. Makes you truly wonder how anyone survive in this day and age relying on a hunk of meat programmed for the savanna. Alas, fallible humans, overflowing with biases."
297,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16159568-jack,1,"Terribly written. The author's tone is obnoxious, but that's hardly a problem if it can be substantiated; I know nothing about the stock market and all that nonsense, but I wouldn't say I learnt anything, because Taleb's overall message is 'yeah man nobody knows anything it's all bullshit but I'm the finance Socrates cause I can pierce the veil.' A fourteen-year old boy would tell me the same, and he might less arrogantly assert his superiority over other economics guys (which I have no problem of a writer doing in and of itself, for I've no love lost for those sorts) by proclaiming himself uniquely literate, because he's read Borges. The thing about these pop-science non-fiction books is that when the writer steps into the domain that the reader is not completely ignorant of and proves himself foolish, the confidence game is over. Taleb is no longer brashly entertaining; just embarrassing. What middle-aged man brags about reading ""fantasy, but for intellectuals""? Wish I could stuff this dweeb in a locker. I'm a left-leaning, idealistic young person, so I'm inclined to view global finance as some sort of intractable moral void purely as a product of my circumstances, but this book only fed into that ignorance in the laziest way, by allowing me, if I so choose, to parrot the opinions of a guy famous for loudly calling himself smart. So, regarding the business of it all, I must remain with judgment withheld. Surely there must be something better to read than this."
298,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"Have you ever heard of Buridan’s ass? It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.I think the book is great. It was fun, funny, useful, insightful and especially relevant in the information age we currently live in."
299,0812975219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,2,"There is a lot of value in this book, but ultimately it's a nearly-400 page exercise in separating pseudoscientific and pseudo-rational bullshit from valuable insights and arguments. Taleb delights in tearing down established thought structures and financial models, sometimes with convincing, evidence- and logic-based arguments but just as frequently by attacking straw men. As someone with a Ph.D. in a quantitative scientific field, I don't think Taleb's understanding of statistics and probability is nearly as good as he thinks it is; he commits some fundamental errors of understanding in this (and other) work(s). This is not a bad book to read, but in my opinion, it should be read with a critical eye. Taleb writes with extreme grandiosity and self-importance and seldom allows the slightest room for the notion that he could be wrong about something. This attitude is dangerous in anyone and this book should be read with that in mind. There are good ideas in here, but others are erroneous; if something doesn't make sense or seems strange to you, it's worth digging into further because the problem very well may not be in your mind but in the author's arguments.
