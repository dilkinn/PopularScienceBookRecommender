Although sometimes the examples diverge from the point, Burnett’s comedy and wit tend to make it worthwhile and very enjoyable. The book is plagued with scientific riches presented in the most elegant way possible. I not only learned loads from the book, but have used it for episodes on my YouTube channel. Extremely accessible and very enjoyable! "

(not really). Admittedly, specialists would probably find the explanations simplistic (I extrapolate), but then, why would they read this book in the first place? Neuroscientists, this book is not for you. You think you're so clever, right? (hehe) Anyway, given that my knowledge on the subject is very limited (understand : I studied language and metacognition in teaching school, had some notions about the way our vision sucks, but that's about it), Idiot Brain: What Your Head Is Really Up To was a pleasurable and interesting book for me. I tend to find non-fiction books hard to rate, because my usual categories do not work : there's no such thing as a world-building or characters, for example. However, even these beloved categories are never really objective - or, rather, the way I use them is necessarily subjective, because Hello, biases. Therefore it won't come as a surprise that I followed a fundamentally biased pattern to give my stars : ... Also, I have a better self-esteem now because I realized that being Cartesian (mostly, I'm still afraid of clowns and dolls, BECAUSE OF REASONS) after having been raised surrounded by superstitions and other beliefs is actually pretty great. Yay, me. I kid, I kid. Mostly.I do know that technically, there are seven (eight) stars, but then, I never said that I was logical. The truth is, even though there were parts harder to get through, I was never bored. Now, perhaps this review is part of a great conspiracy to make you spend your money. Perhaps. *Looks in the distance*We'll never know...star vectorFor more of my reviews, please visit:

2,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta-g,5,"“Dedicated to every human with a brain. It’s not an easy thing to put up with, so well done.”Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist who also dabbles in stand-up comedy and writes a popular science blog ‘Brain Flapping’ for the Guardian, has written a very accessible and entertaining book on the weird and peculiar processes in the brain that influence everything we say, do and experience. Our sense of self and all that goes with it – memory, language, emotion, perception and so on – is supported by processes in our brain. Everything you are is a feature of your brain, and much of what your brain does is dedicated to making you look and feel as good as possible: the brain is largely egotistical. The brain is primed to think up potential threats and makes us constantly afraid. The brain’s love of patterns and hatred of randomness leads many people to bizarre beliefs, superstition and conspiracy theories. To the brain, bad things are typically more potent than good things, and criticism typically carries more weight than praise; praise is just telling us what we already know. Less intelligent people usually have illogical self-confidence, and the more confident a person is, the more convincing he is and the more others tend to trust and believe the claims he makes. Apparently it’s human nature that we pay more attention to confident clowns than to insecure intellectuals, who can be perceived as a threat by our egotistical brain.The metaphorical devil and angel on your shoulder are actually lodged in your head. The regions associated with producing motivation and responsive behaviour are present in both brain hemispheres, but do different things on each side; in the right hemisphere they produce negative, avoidance or withdrawal reactions to unpleasant things, and in the left hemisphere they produce positive, active, approach behaviour. Anger is seen as negative and harmful, but it turns out that anger is sometimes useful, because it lowers cortisol, and thus reduces the potential harm caused by stress. Studies have shown that anger causes raised activity in the motivational system in the left hemisphere, potentially prompting someone to deal with a stress-causing threat, thus lowering cortisol further. The right side’s influence doesn’t lead to anything being done about apparent threats, so they persist, causing anxiety and stress. So it’s fine to be angry, just don’t get angry at me! Just buy a punching bag or something. Carefully choose your friends and the group you want to belong to, because other people deeply impact our thought processes; the brain prefers to use other people as a go-to reference for information and for determining our actions in uncertain scenarios. You can’t choose your family, but you can choose your friends. Under certain conditions, a group can actually suppress our individuality ; groupthink can take precedence over logical or reasonable decisions and a lot of extreme or worrying opinions concerning controversial subjects could be explained by group polarisation. No individual who’s part of a group is immune to this; our brain’s desire for group harmony is powerful. People derive much of their identity from the groups they belong to ; in certain conditions this can seriously alter our behaviour, and our brain can make us hostile to those who threaten our group or undermine the group uniformity. We care what other people think of us at a neurological level, and will go to great lengths to make them like us. All of which makes me conclude that in order to avoid being egotistical, to become carefree and confident, and to maintain your individuality, just don’t use your brain."
3,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,4,"I have never needed well researched neuropsychology to tell me that my brain is an idiot. The years I have spent alive have proved this to me without question. What this book has allowed me to feel is relief that i'm not the only idiot and the reasons why. Thankfully it's given me an out for some of the ridiculous behaviour I have displayed in the past (and still sometimes do if i'm honest). On the other hand, it's become clear that some of it is still just me. Oh well.Written in an engaging, humorous style and with a lovely voiced Welsh narrator in the Audible version, this book is well worth a listen. It walks that perfect line of being clever but funny, allowing you to listen and learn with a smile on your face. There are so many examples of the things that *everyone* does that you'll be constantly wanting to contact friends and family to let them know why it is they walk into rooms and stand there wondering what the hell they came for... as just one example. You'll be pleased to have finally found out the answer. Though you'll probably forget that too."
4,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24866027-will-once,5,"Stonking (a technical term).This is one of those ""popular science"" books. These normally fall into one of two categories. Some are well written but not very authoritative. Others are not very well written, but well researched. In other words, the usual choice is between insubstantial fluff and weighty but indigestible text book.The Idiot Brian is that rarest of rare things. A science book that is both well researched and well written.Highly recommended. And five stars.It is especially recommended for anyone who believes in conspiracy theories. The answers you are looking for are in here. Promise."
5,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Dean Burnett is a neuroscientist. He writes a regular blog for The Guardian, called Brain Flapping. And his writing style is not just entertaining, it is spirited and humorous and faithful to the science as well. Oh, and did I mention that he is a stand-up comedian? He signs his name ""Dean Burnett, Ph.D. (no, really)"" While most of this book is about psychology, he grounds quite a lot of his discussions in descriptions of the parts of the brain that are responsible for different actions. And, I learned a lot from this book, and actually, a lot of very useful things. Here I just scratch the surface of what I learned.Short-term memory can hold only up to four items, and lasts less than a minute. Anything more than this is actually part of long-term memory. When trying to remember things, context is very helpful--both internal as well as external context. For example, if you are on a drug (even alcohol) when learning something, recalling it at a later time is easier if you on the same drug. The brain encodes memories slightly differently if you are slightly intoxicated.Burnett does scatter sarcasm throughout the book, but it is in good fun. For example, at the end of the section about the ego bias of memory, he writes, ""The upside of this is, even if you don't quite understand what's been written here, you'll probably remember that you did, so it all ends up the same regardless. Good work.""And here is one of my favorite quotes of all time: ""I'm also part of the great conspiracy of global scientists to promote the myths of climate change, evolution, vaccination, and a spherical earth. After all, there's nobody on earth wealthier and more powerful than scientists, and they can't risk losing this exalted position by people finding out how the world really works.""It is so interesting how Burnett explains why know-nothings often win arguments and are believed. He writes that empty vessels make the most noise. People who are self-confident are most believed. Politicians are great at this. The smarter a person is, the less confident in their views, and the less they are trusted. Anti-intellectualism is due to the brain's egocentric bias or ""self-serving"" bias and the tendency to fear things. Someone who seems more intelligent is perceived as a threat. A physically fit person is easy to understand--they just go to the gym more. But someone who is more intelligent is an unknowable quantity, and the ""better safe than sorry"" instinct triggers suspicion and hostility. People with low intellectual abilities lack the ability to recognize that they are bad at something, so they are unjustifiably high in self-confidence. They have only their own experiences to go from, and cannot perceive what it is to be considerably more intelligent. It works the other way, too. Intelligent are more aware that they don't know everything, so that undercuts their self confident.The general consensus is that by the mid-20's, our brains are fully developed. Brain training games do not boost general intelligence. If you play them enough you can get better at them--but not better at anything else.I was amazed by the description of patients with aphasia, who cannot understand language. Nevertheless, in an experiment they found humor in a president's speech. Robbed of the ability to understand language, they develop their ability to decipher nonverbal cues. They can recognize from numerous facial tics, body language, rhythm of speech, and elaborate gestures, exactly when the president is lying!And here is another fascinating tidbit, having to do with the ""Social Brain Hypothesis"". We evolved big, complex brains as a result of human friendliness and complicated relationships. We want to believe that the world is fair. When we see a victim of something terrible, the brain doesn't like dissonance, so we have two options: conclude that the world is cruel and random, or that the victim did something to deserve it. While believing the victim is responsible is crueler, it allows us to keep our nice cozy assumptions about the world, and we blame victims for their misfortune. ""Our brain is so concerned with preserving a sense of identity and peace of mind that it makes us willing to screw over anyone and anything that could endanger this. Charming.""Again, I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a serious book about psychology and the brain, but with more than just a dash of humor."
6,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,4,"***NO SPOILERS***Who says books about the brain have to be boring? In Idiot Brain, neuroscientist Dean Burnett explained how the most complex organ in the human body is both awe-inspiring and...idiotic.My greatest take-away from Idiot Brain is that the brain isn't evolved enough--or rather, it's very stuck in the past. This is how it's idiotic. It responds to situations in ways that don't always make sense because it's still responding to ancient situations, not the modern ones it now needs to. At the same time, these ancient responses are what have kept humans alive for millennia, so they're very sticky.Burnett examined major topics such as fear, memory, intelligence, personality, mental illness, observation, and--one of the most interesting to me--group behavior. Each chapter is broken down more specifically; for instance, the chapter on mental illness covers suicide and addiction.Idiot Brain covers a lot and answered countless questions I've had, such as why, when I look at an electrical outlet, I see two eyes and a mouth; how exactly addiction works and why relapse is so common; the mechanics of the eye and how closely it works with the brain; why the mind will believe in superstitions and conspiracy theories; how psychosis can cause visual and auditory hallucinations and delusions. This is but a tiny sampling. Idiot Brain is one of many neuroscience books written for non-neuroscientists, but it stands out for being a really well-balanced blend of technical and accessible. Aspiring neuroscientists will enjoy it, but it’s basic and not terribly neuro-heavy, so therefore suitable for an everyday reader. This isn't to say it's a lightweight; after all, Burnett is a neuroscientist. He used the tongue-tying scientific names for specific parts of the brain and explained the mechanics as a scientist would. But it's clear he isn't a scientist so out-of-touch with non-scientists that he's unable to explain on a basic level.Burnett's dabbling in stand-up comedy may be why. His humor is definitely an asset, as the book has a somewhat jaunty tone and a sprinkling of jokes. He's the fun, cool teacher with actual talent--an expert in a field who knows how to distill a complicated topic down to its most basic parts, and without a hint of arrogance. He also knew, almost instinctively, the very moment to move on from scientific explanations. His book is a good complement to (the more psychology-focused) Why We Make Mistakes: How We Look Without Seeing, Forget Things in Seconds, and Are All Pretty Sure We Are Way Above Average and (the more science-focused) Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain."
7,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9752222-neil,4,A very humane and entertaining look at how the brain works (and works against us). It's only downside is I felt an annoying need to read out various passages to whoever would listen. 
8,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21432277-supratim,4,"Pop neuroscience at its best! Good job, Dr. Dean Burnett! Good job indeed!This book has been written by Dr. Dean Burnett, a neuroscientist who used to write a satirical science column for the Guardian.I had come across this book in a book sale; the cover attracted my attention, the title and the blurb piqued my interest.I must say that I did enjoy this light-hearted book on the human brain, and while reading this book I was constantly reminded of Oliver Sack’s seminal work – The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat. While Sack’s book conveyed the complexity and vulnerability of the brain, Burnett takes irreverent jibes at the brain. But, at the same time he also says,  “..It’s a still awesome with a capacity and adaptability that puts even the most modern supercomputer to shame. The inherent flexibility and weird organization is something that evolved over millions of years, so who am I to criticize?”  The author admits that the human brain is awesome, but has imperfections. He also says,  “ If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn’t.”  What could be a better praise!It is a fun read and I enjoyed the author’s humour. I was a bit unwell during the days when I was reading the book and it served as a comfort read. You might have studied a lot of the things the author has mentioned about the brain in your high school biology class. Thus, if you are expecting a profound read about the brain with new scientific information, then this is not the book for you. If you want a light read and the subject matter appeals to you, then you might want to give this book a try."

Chapters are dedicated to the subjects of brain/body connections, memory, fear, intelligence, observational systems, personality, sociability, and mental health.The audacious use of the word ""idiot"" in the title is a bit off-putting, but it probably communicates a similar message as those books titled, ""(blank) for Dummies."" It makes clear that the author and publisher have aimed this book at a ""popular"" reading audience.

Brain Flapping
. His writing style is light and filled with humor, and as best I can tell the information conveyed is a respectable and correct reflection of current knowledge in the field of neurology (but I'm not particularly qualified to judge). If you check out his blog you will see that his writing does not match the style of the usual academic person.This book is filled with an abundance of information about the various branches of neurology. While listening to the audio edition of this book I was wondering how I could summarize the variety of material for this review. Then at the beginning of the last chapter on mental health the author solved my task by providing the following summary of what the reader has learned about the human brain so far.What have we learned so far about the human brain? It messes with memories; it jumps at shadows; it's terrified of harmless things; it screws with our diet, our sleeping, our movement; it convinces us that we're brilliant when we're not; it makes up half the things we perceive; it gets us to do irrational things when emotional; it causes us to make friends incredibly quickly and turn on them in an instant;—a worrying list. What's even more worrying, it does all of this when it's working correctly. So what happens when the brain starts to go, for want of a better word, wrong? That's when we end up with a neurological or mental disorder.  The preceding quotation sounds a bit flippant, which is reflective of the author's writing style. But within the context of the material provided in the preceding chapters it's a representative sampling. In general I found this book to be a good overall description of what is currently known about the workings of the brain. The author reminds the reader multiple times that knowledge in this field is changing and some of the material presented may be subject to change as knowledge in the field develops. _______The following is not from this book. But it is about neurology.I just happened to come across this link while getting ready to write this review. It's about the differences between people on the ability to recognize faces. That happens to be one branch of neurology. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/1..."
11,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"A very readable popular science book from a neuroscientist/comedian (yeah, so many of them). Lots of good jokes and the technical bits are conveyed as lightly as possible for a lay reader. My main takeaway is to see the brain as something of a mess, a cobbled together lot of stuff rather than a brilliantly adapted organ. Explains a lot."
12,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16200898-jeremy,4,"While this book may not be easy to read through, it was well worth the effort. I am sure that neuroscience junkies will enjoy this book. For myself, with only a slight background of this topic, I found the terminology and whatnot to be a little hard to remember, but Burnett excels in bringing analogs to his readers. I love that he compares many of the brain's processes to everyday events. Burnett writes well in the sense that I can always get a chuckle out of reading a chapter. The subjects in the book can be difficult to wrap one's head around, but it was still a very enjoyable read.*Note: I was given an advanced copy of the book from NetGalley. I think I need to mention that somewhere."

It is however, a book of two halves, interestingly – or coincidentally, just like the brain.The first half has its roots in the psychology/biology relationship and was massively informative - in the educational perspective (I should say here that I listened to the audio book, which has probably the best narration of any I have encountered. Well done Mr Addis, outstanding job!) The second half is heavily into the science. The title gives it away really.I absolutely loved this book, it is educational, informative and engaging. Mr Burnett’s use of metaphor is not only wonderfully appropriate, aiding memory and retention of what can be difficult subject matter, but also fantastically funny!I’m going to end this hero worship now before I run out of superlatives. Listen to the audio, you’ll love it … "
14,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,3,"Idiot Brain is a delve into the messy ways the brain works and how it can sometimes go awry. It touches upon a variety of interesting topics, including what is intelligence, how does memory work, what determines personality, and what happens when the brain isn't working correctly.My favorite section is Chapter 7's discussion about the brain's tendency to favor a ""just and fair world"", so if we see bad things happen to others, we tend to blame them, especially if the victim is someone we strongly identify with. The brain sees it as, if that someone is just like us and bad things are happening to them, then it must be due to their own fault... otherwise, the world is random and bad things may happen to us too, which is very unpleasant for the brain to contemplate.A weakness of this book is that instead of leading the reader on a journey of understanding, everything is just told to the reader, one fact after another. This makes it hard to retain much information, as it's too dense. I would've liked to have seen more examples of the interesting psychology experiments that the author alludes to and that give rise to some of the findings, but those are quickly glossed over in a lot of places. Also, a lot of time is spent on giving proper scientific terms to everything, which I don't think is really necessary for better understanding of the content. Another weakness is that at times the book reads like a stream of consciousness that hasn't seen an editor. This is most evident in Chapter 8, where a section comes off as the author ranting against anyone who doesn't understand that depression isn't a result of selfishness. While I agree with that, the section contains very little scientific evidence to back up that claim... it was mostly just the author going on.In conclusion, while the topics covered in this book are interesting and it has a few illuminating moments within its pages, I think the way it's presented makes it hard to retain and take a lot out of the book. Also, the quality of the sections in the book are uneven, with some being very well-researched and insightful, and others much less so."

I found the writing style condescending at times, and the attempts at humour tiresome."

I then saw it at a friend's the other week and she let me borrow it. I knew I would like it from the first paragraph about ""Gary"". A humorous look at the human brain, it covers a multitude of subjects we would all do well to learn about. My favourite parts included the 'just world' (just as in fair) idea, which makes a lot of sense from what I see happening around me, and the chapter on depression because the author really pushes for lay people to understand that depression IS a physical disorder, and that it ISN'T a chosen path where one may ""selfishly"" commit suicide. I want more people to truly comprehend this. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the editing job. There were many errors, with some words missing while others were added, along with continual use of the word 'lead' instead of the correct 'led'. However, this probably only concerns those of us with a brain inclined toward grammatical perfection... Would be good to see follow up books about individual subjects, as this one was an introduction to all sorts of brain functions and disorders. As a migraine sufferer, I'd love to see a neuroscientist explaining the illness to a wider audience, but that may just be a dream for now."

What's super distinct about this book is the format it's written in: informal to a point that you'll feel that the author is talking directly to you. It's really not a normal scientific book, for almost all details in the are explained in a way that even an idiot will get it; so don't worry if you don't like biology and neuroscience. After reading this book, you'll stop fighting with your friends over who has the right memory or judge a person who commits suicide or has an addiction to drugs.

If you've ever wondered why people might be irrationally scared of shadows in the dark, or seeing familiar shapes in the clouds, or having a really hard time quitting addictive substances, Idiot Brain has the answers for you.

Burnett covers a lot of ground in the book: memory, fear, intelligence, personality, how the senses work and are intertwined (fascinating stuff), and mental problems, among other things. Nothing is gone into in great depth, and we get just a basic discussion on any of these topics, but that's exactly what the book presents itself as. And, as I said, Burnett's writing is fun to read. (Example #2, on the subject of motivation: ""Sex is a very powerful motivator. For proof of this, see anything ever."") If I had a criticism of the book, it would be that the final chapter (""When the Brain Breaks Down"") deals with mental disorders: depression, nervous breakdowns, drug addiction, hallucinations and delusions. Important stuff, to be sure, but as the final chapter, it closed the book on a downer note. A concluding section (other than the one-line ""afterword"" presented) would have been appreciated. "

So, when Dean Burnett, Ph.D. chose to describe all that the brain does to make you amazing, he did it in a uniquely humane and entertaining way. His popular science book Idiot Brain: What Your Head is Really Up To is well-researched, well-written, and highly recommended for anyone interested in learning about how the brain works, fails to work, and even works against you.What makes Idiot Brain so wonderful is that it’s not a simple, linear, boring discussion of the brain with explanations starting from a description of a neuron and developing into more complex behaviors (as a textbook often does). Instead, Idiot Brain presents a comedic discussion of the brain that usually centers around the stranger things the brain does, especially the processes that make us do peculiar things. For example, why do we see a scary monster in the doorway when it’s just a bathrobe hanging on the door? And why is there always room for dessert at the end of a huge meal? And why did I just come into this room anyway?“The brain is a terrifyingly complex tangle of connections and links, like a ball of Christmas-tree lights the size of the known universe.”Thankfully, Dean Burnett is a neuroscientist, who moonlights as a comedian and writes for The Guardian, so he can dissect the brain and its functions in accurate yet accessible ways, with quips and analogies to ease the examination. I encourage anyone with a brain to read Idiot Brain because the brain is both extremely impressive, but also a bit stupid."
28,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50753966-joshua-i-james,4,"The Idiot Brain starts of hilarious and almost tricks us into learning by slowly easing into how the brain works (or doesn't). Dean Burnett keeps the book light and humorous while going into the complex workings of the human brain. The author tends to introduce a concept in a relatively technical way, and then explain it with everyday thought malfunctions that leave the reader severely conscious of all of the processes that is going on with their body; I can still feel my eyes constantly jumping around when focusing on one point. The book is full of so many interesting topics, but I particularly enjoyed explanations about how the brains faulty wiring gives rise to things like superstitions. Near the end of the book, technical terms are used to describe parts of the brain. Don't worry. Dr. Burnett finds hilarious ways to describe what those parts of the brain do. As someone with no background in the topic, I found the book easy to understand, fun to read, and even managed to learn a thing or two about humanity. "

So that’s the brain. Impressive, isn’t it? But, also, a bit stupid.
This gonna be one of my favourite books of 2020. Precise, funny & educative. I loved that it had many topics about the brain but in a fun way that made my idiot brain understand it.I recommend it for everyone who wants to understand a little bit about this wonderful yet stupid part of our body."

The doc Dean Burnett can simplify the neuroanatomy and neruophysiology in the simple way for anyone not only just for the professtional in this field. He can also relate between the medicine and the psycology in amazing way. I understood many information about the brain more than attendence lectures in my college. In the end i wish that i can advise anyone to read this book to know how our brain is working! and how it can trick us!

It's also quite impressive he manages to do so in a wittingly manner.The interconnectedness and consistency of the book make for a pleasant reading experience as do the accurate anecdotes and examples. Personally, I really enjoyed broadening my horizon but occasionally the terminology proved slighty overwhelming. Nevertheless, nomen est omen, as this book completely delivers on what you'd expect based on the title.All things considered the book makes for an interesting, serieus but also humorous read, for which it deserves my recommendation."

The book discusses in detail about myriad flaws that plague it, ranging from issues with intelligence, to fear, stress, perception etc. What I enjoyed most though, was Dean's sense of humour. It was funny without trying too hard. He gave the vibe of a fun professor engaging his students in class."

36,0393354113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10382394-elly-schrody,4,"*General rant*It often feels how many experts, when writing a pop science or more specific science books, think they don't need editors and proofreaders, and they're wrong. I've read several (not too much, but not too little either) science books (and that's all that I read nowadays), and every single one of them had the same issues. Yes, it's impossible (or should I say improbable?) to find and fix every single grammar or spelling mistake, but that's why you have editors. Comparing fiction to non-fiction, I must say that authors who aren't just authors (but primarily medical or physics experts) are often guilty of such things. Maybe because it is popularly thought that fiction has to be ""perfect"" when it comes to grammar, otherwise it won't sell. News flash: grammar is important in every field, in every genre. Please, hire editors, and if you think they haven't done a good job - hire another one. I can't stress enough how it can (and it does) mess with your reading, when you have to read the sentence several times because the sentence construction is up side down. Proofread like your life depends on it.Thank you.*Rant over.*This is one of the better books I've read in a while, when it comes to non-fiction. Its clear and concise writing, understandable to a common man (like myself) caught my attention from the first page.

And there are a few, but mostly, it's more general brain stuff. It's much more day to day than some of the heavier psychological books I've read, so learning about stuff that happens to you but you don't know why. There's also quite a bit that's relevant right now in regards to biases, groupthink and why we can be terrible to people in need of help instead of empathetic.

Chapters are dedicated to how our mind regulate our body, memories and it fallacies, fears and phobias, how our brain perceives the world around us, how the brain is influenced by others, intelligence, personality and mental health.In this book, the author explores many topics and attempts to answer questions like:-	Why do we sleep-	Why we remember people faces better than names (I’m so guilty of this one)-	We may not be as clever as we believe, how to measure intelligence-	The link between superstition and conspiracy theories-	Is it possible to boost your brain power-	Why memories are triggered by smells-	The important function of emoticons in txts (non verbal communication)-	Etc.Complex subjects are presented in simple and informal language, the use of down-to-earth similes help to the reader to make meaningful connections, and often these comparisons are quite funny. I found fascinating the research into group dynamics, mirror neurons and how our actions and decision are influenced by other people, resulting in extreme behaviours such as the bystander effect, groupthink, group polarization, deindividuation or mob mentality. The chapter dedicated to intelligence was also extremely interesting. A few quick surprising facts I’ve learned: •	Stupid people are more likely to enter arguments and win them (the reason has to do with confidence)•	Sommeliers’ ability to taste fine wines is highly overrated •	It seems our facial expressions are innate, rather than learned, ‘hard-wired’ into the human brain•	Only in 1973 did the American Psychiatric Association declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder (Meanwhile, the World Health Organization only removed homosexuality from its ICD classification with the publication of ICD-10 in 1992).Dean Burnett has a PhD in Neouroscience, which guarantees a solid scientific basis but, most importantly, he writes with an engaging style, that makes the book an enjoyable easy read, not dry at all, quite a feat for a science book. A fascinating and intelligent mix of neuroscience and psychology. Highly recommended.Fav. Quotes: To challenge further the assumption that sleep is all about rest and conserving energy, sleep has been observed in hibernating animals. That is, in animals that are already unconscious. Hibernation isn’t the same as sleep; the metabolism and body temperature drop much lower; it lasts longer; it’s closer to a coma really. But hibernating animals regularly enter a sleep state, so they use more energy in order to fall asleep! This idea that sleep is about rest is clearly not the whole story.[…] for scary books or films, […] the individual is a passive observer and, while caught up in the narrative, has no influence over what happens in it. (You can close a book, but that doesn’t alter the story.) Sometimes the impressions and experiences of the film or book can stay with us long after, unsettling us for quite some time. The vivid memories will explain this, as they keep being revisited and activated as they “bed in.” Overall, the more the brain retains control over events, the less scary they are. This is why some things that are “best left to the imagination” are actually more terrifying than the goriest effects.Some people like to think (or hope) that there is a gene for intelligence, something that could make us smarter if it was activated or strengthened. This seems unlikely; just as intelligence is the sum of many different processes, so these processes are controlled by many different genes, all of which have a part to play. Wondering which gene is responsible for a trait such as intelligence is like wondering which piano key is responsible for a symphony.Fingerprints are basically the pattern of ridges in the skin at the end of our digits. Yet, despite this simplicity, almost every human on earth has unique fingerprints. If surface patterns of small patches of skin offer enough variety for everyone to have his or her own exclusive set, how much more variety is possible with something that is the result of countless subtle connections and complex features of the human brain, the most complicated thing in the universe? Even to attempt to determine someone’s personality with a simple tool like a written test should be utterly futile, a task akin to sculpting Mount Rushmore with a plastic fork.“Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better but the frog dies in the process”—E. L. White. Unfortunately, science is largely about rigorous analysis and explaining things, so this may be why science and humor are often seen as mutually exclusive.Dismissing the concerns of a person with genuine depression because you’ve been miserable and got over it is like dismissing someone who’s had to have their arm amputated because you once had a papercut."

Particular gems: the more privileged a person is, the less they are able to empathize or even imagine the extent of others' suffering, our brains are designed to prevent us from sympathizing with victims and thus the victim blaming that is like a disease in modern society, depression and thoughts of suicide are NOT reflections of a selfish person, and people who are depressed should NOT be treated as though they're just being selfish, WE ARE WHAT WE SENSE, and OUR SENSORY SYSTEMS ARE NOT PERFECT. The more I read about the brain, the better person I'm becoming, as I'm realizing just how little control the average person has over who they are. That's not to say that I don't believe in personal responsibility, just that it's much much much more difficult to be in control of our own lives than we think."

I found it quite insightful, especially when trying to understand how other people think, what is going on inside their heads. The section on group think provided clarity on why we as a society are having some of the issues we are experiencing today as well as what depression is and isn't and how it is and isn't the brain trying to cope with a malfunction of itself. The last part I found interesting is the explanation for people who walk around talking to themselves and I don't mean speaking your own words aloud to yourself, I mean those people walking around the library speaking to someone who is not there. The interesting part was how this phenomenon is related to why you can't tickle yourself. Interesting read. "

So logic dictates that Dr. Dean Burnett, neuroscientist at Cardiff University and author of The Idiot Brain, is either a strong practitioner of defending the striking arts or a masochist. To my surprise, he is neither.What he is, is an adroit and humorous individual with a unique set of skills and a particular way of sharing them that is both informative and entertaining. In The Idiot Brain - A Neuroscientist Explains What Your Head is Really Up To, Burnett offers a look at the marvel and misfit that lives behind our eyes in a way that only a neuroscientist / comedian could.“One of the ways the brain sorts out the important information from the unimportant is by recognizing and focusing on patterns.”This book examines the brain from a perspective mostly taken from the field of neuro-psychology, with the goal of filling a need as a popular science book about the brain as opposed to a text assigned to pre-doctoral neurology students. With a breadth over depth approach, the book covers a range of topics including the brain's relationship with the body, why we are not exactly sure where intelligence comes from, the brain's haphazard way of seeing the world and why we are so powerfully influenced by others.“If you want to be more intelligent, you have to be very determined or very smart to outsmart your brain.”If you spend your days dressed in lab coats pouring over fMRI results and drilling holes in the skulls of fellow human beings, this is not the neuroscience book for you. However, if you spend your days in coveralls, cardigans or concert tees wondering what the hell is going on ‘up there between your ears’ and dreaming about drilling holes in the skulls of your boss, siblings and random strangers on the subway, this book is definitely for you. It will educate you about the brain, why it is awesome and ridiculous at the same time and will quite possibly prevent you from being arrested for firing up that drill on a crowded subway commute.Overall Score 3.3 / 5In a Sentence: A book about the brain that we can all understand and enjoy, just don’t call me an idiot."

Written by Dean Burnett, this makes an interesting popular science book. He tries to explain things we / our brain do(es) that seem weird: for example about anxieties, motion sickness, traumas, handling criticism, sleep paralysis, egoistic biases, sleepwalking, and being angry. Almost everything is looked at from an evolutionary perspective: often as for why traits could have been useful back in the days when we had a reptile brain and an unpredictable environment, but now we are stuck with it. This is supported with a lot of scientific research and well found metaphors by Dean Burnett. The book is quite an easy-read especially when having some neurological or biological background. I am aware of a second book, The Happy Brain, but I guess I am more interested in idiot brains than happy ones.. so I am not sure if I will check it out yet, but this one is definitely recommendable.Things I did not know about yet but found interesting: - There is a correlation between height and intelligence- Your short-term-memory only comprises of one minute and has an average maximum of only four items- The difference between fluid and crystellized intelligence- Savant syndrome- The more intelligent a person is, the less specific an IQ-test is - Heritability is the measurement of the extent to which variation among groups is genetic in nature, not the extent to which genes cause something. - The Flynn effect: about how intelligence is increasing worldwide- Proprioception, balance and appetite could be seen as extra senses to the regular 5- How we perceive edges of items and why this is useful- Why we have limited capacity of attention- The Foot-in-the-door and the Door-in-the-face techniques to convince someone more easilyQuotes: ´It´s bad enough when you´ve got your own brain conspiring against you so severely.

Such topics include the neurological systems underlying personality, love, motion sickness, anger, social interactions, and facial expressions.

For example, there's a lot of digression about why we remember faces before names and in the discussion about depression and suicide. The humorous style of the book might not be to everyone's taste.

It is when a brain scientist tries to explain what's going on in our head daily without too complex language. From what happened when we are angry, is anger good for us? Why some politician that knows almost nothing about a particular subject appear more convincing than a scientist? Why micromanaging is mostly unproductive? Why do we like/need outside approval? Why do we strive to be liked? How do our brain works in a group setting? Why depression affects is so potent as compared to when we experienced happiness?The writer has a good sense of humor, this makes the reading it more enjoyable. There is a limited amount of details, good enough to make a point and below the threshold of boring. Unfortunately, it's all words. It would be great if there is some illustration, especially when he talked about parts of the brains.From books that I read about the brain, nothing is certain. Every brain is unique. Some part (a large part?) is still a mystery. After reading this book, I learn a bit more about my self. After all, what defines us as a person is our thought, value, idea, memory etc. All those things reside in our brain.  Also now I'm a bit skeptical to the talks/argument that tries to explain our brain in a very simple manner. something like left-brain is for exact thinking, right is of creativity; or brain has 3 main sections and the 'why' processing is at its core. etc. I think the truth is vastly more complex than that. That is why I think reading this book is so much fun."
