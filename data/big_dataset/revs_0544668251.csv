0,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,1,"We all have one, that person we'd prefer to get along with, but every time they open their mouth, so much stupid erupts that low-level irritation shifts into rage (there's a certain political figure that I react to every time).That about sums up my experience with Thing Explainer.Every time I picked it up intending to read a few 'cartoons' explaining concepts like helicopters, the cell, elevators or the auto engine, I'd end up either generally annoyed or quite specifically angry. Thing Explainer fails on so many levels for me, it was shocking. I went into it hoping for the grown-up version of Charlie Brown's Super Book of Questions and Answers about All Kinds of Animals ... from Snails to People!: Based on the Charles M. Schulz Characters and instead found cartoon explanations of things I still don't understand, such as how all the parts of a car work together. I understand that it was supposed to be funny, but I was hoping for informative as well.It wasn't.Language is meant to communicate ideas. Generally, more complex ideas require more specific words to convey meaning. Remember when you last talked to a two or three year-old and everything with four legs was 'dog,' everything that flew was a 'bird' and every time someone cried they must be 'sad?' When we are just beginning to understand words represent things and concepts, simple language suffices, but as we grow in age and sophistication, we learn words can be more specific in representing object and idea. The more we grow in experiences and want to convey information with accuracy, the more we need that vocabulary.But specificity does not have to be incomprehensible. For instance, in explaining what leukemia was to someone who was just diagnosed with it, I first had to teach about red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. I taught these common terms, so that we all understood what it would mean when the nurse says, ""your red blood cells are low and you need a transfusion."" To explain, I didn't have to use vocabulary like 'erythrocytes,' 'leukeocytes' and 'thrombocytes;' simple descriptions such as ""white blood cells fight off infection"" and analogies like ""soldiers fighting against an enemy invader"" explain without being incomprehensible. But the terms 'cells,' 'transfusion,' 'infection,' 'red,' and 'white' are non-negotiable in learning the concepts related to blood. You have to understand them to understand communication about body processes.I tested Thing Explainer on something I know: Cells. Our body's cells are reduced to ""Bags of Water."" Inside the bags of water are other bags such as the 'bag filler,' the 'bags of death water,' 'bag shapers,' 'little builders,' and 'empty pockets.'I found myself mentally trying to translate his terms into appropriate terminology: nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes and Golgi apparatus, except I ended up irritated because endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes sound alike with his description and I couldn't remember what Golgi bodies do. How is this even helpful? How does this help anyone understand the cell? DNA? Cancer? Genetics? It doesn't. I tested it on something I didn't know: the automobile engine. ""The Fire box computer watches how the fire box is working, and decides how much fire water to add to the air it sends in."" Did this help? No. As he used the same words to explain its as to describe it, it's a useless explanation, like describing a circle as a 'round shape.'There were occasional exceptions. The periodic table of elements was mildly amusing with descriptions like ""green burning air that kills,"" ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" ""the rock that makes up beaches, glass and computer brains,"" and at the end, ""stuff that lasts for the time it takes you to close and open your eyes."" However, for it to be funny, you have to know the table and elements off the top of your head. So, not so much for almost everyone.It took me a lot of reflection to pinpoint the source of my rage: while Munroe disingenuously suggests that he is explaining 'complicated concepts in simple words,' he does so in such a way that the reader needs to understand the concept well to interpret his illustrations. This approach simultaneously insults the person who doesn't understand using the illusion of 'common words,' while creating an in-joke for people knowledgeable about those concepts.The other reason it made me angry is my impression that like many people, Munroe is confusing 'complex' with 'incomprehensible' or 'pretentious.' He gives it away in the forward (""Page Before the Book Starts"") when he says ""I was really just worried that if I used the small words, someone might think I didn't know the big ones."" A truly gifted person would be able to communicate with clarity instead of relying on circuitous explanations and false construction of word limits (he includes his personal emails in his source for the ""1000 most common words""). Instead of actually communicating, what he did is replacement code sophisticated concepts into simple words, so to understand his comic, one mentally replaces ""fire box"" with 'engine.' Really, the opposite of explaining things: he would have done just as well to use symbols (which is what he ends up doing for the evolutionary tree). Except it is supposed to be funny when the reader knows the replacement code.I'm not laughing."

The book has such an excellent idea that I only really thought about that when I read it in German, but in the original you can see what a poet Munroe is, and poetry never really translates quite right. Here are some of my favorite passages:SHAPE CHECKERThis machine checks whether you have a piece of metal with a certain shape. If you do, it lets go of whatever it's holding on to. People put these machines on boxes, doors, and cars, to try and control who can open or close them.What's interesting about these machines isn't really the machine itself. There are lots of different kinds that work in different ways, but they're all the same in one way. They try to put people into groups.By checking whether someone has a piece of metal that's the right shape, this machine is really a way to try to tell whether people are who they say they are. It's an idea - about which people should be allowed to do something - brought to life in metal.MACHINE FOR BURNING CITIES(...)When the light metal or air is pushed together, it also starts another run-away fire here. These run-away fires help make each other stronger. By adding more and more steps like this, we found we could make the fires as big as we wanted, and at first we built the machines larger and larger.But then we stopped making the machines larger, and started making them smaller instead. We didn't stop because we didn't want to burn larger cities. We just realized you could burn a city more easily with a few small machines than with one big one. Soon, we had enough small machines to burn as many cities as we wanted.We stopped making the machines larger because the ones we had were big enough to burn everything. There was nothing larger to burn.BIG TINY THING HITTERThis machine works by throwing pieces of air down a hallway so that they hit together really hard. The air hits with so much power that the pieces break in strange new ways, as if it shakes the air - and space itself - so hard that things fall out.Most of these pieces only last for a moment, while space is being shaken really hard, and disappear as quickly as they appear. But by watching what flies out from the place where the air was hit, we can figure out what we shook out.HELPERSA lot of people helped me with this book. Their names aren't words that people use a lot, but I'm going to write them anyway because they're important.People who know a lot of things and told me some of them(...)People who helped a lot(...)And most of all, Strong Pretty Ring-Wearer"
2,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Rather perversely, given that I keep telling people I don't like translations, I read Randall Munroe's new book in German - but I thought it might help develop my language skills to go through this unusual piece of work, where the inventive Mr Munroe spends sixty-one A4 pages explaining a lot of complicated things using a vocabulary of only the one thousand most common words. My feeling is that it's done me some good, despite the disapproving look I got from one of my germanophone colleagues. (""You'll learn all the wrong vocabulary,"" she sighed, shaking her head). But I've hopefully escaped intact: my German is good enough by now that I'm not likely to believe Bildermacher really is the word for ""camera"", or Hochziehzimmer the word for ""elevator"", or Himmelsboot the word for ""airplane"". Anyway, enough about that. The content of the book is more interesting than the language.Most people seem to be treating Thing Explainer as no more than a weird bit of entertainment; but, like Perec in La disparition, I think the author isn't just doing it to demonstrate his ingenuity. A couple of weeks ago, I read an annoying novel called Topologie de l'amour, which purports to give you an idea of what mathematicians are like. The author has evidently met some mathematicians, and he's by no means wrong about everything: for example, mathematicians tend to be very impractical in romantic matters. What he missed, though, is that the interesting thing about them isn't their habit of falling in love with the wrong people, but their way of looking at the world. Munroe's book does a far better job of conveying what that unusual angle is.Clever people, as Munroe says in the introduction, typically like to demonstrate that they're clever by using big, unusual words. Mathematicians don't exactly refuse to use big words, and they can also think it's fun to show off this way. But in their hearts, mathematicians don't want to do this. Mathematics is all about reducing things to their essence, and that means using as few words as possible. If a mathematician could get by using only one word, that would make them truly happy. (Formal logic is the most thoroughgoing expression of this impossible dream). Thing Explainer doesn't go to such absurd lengths, but Munroe shows that you don't need to know a lot of words to be clever; it's enough to understand what the words really mean, and how they are connected to each other and to the world. He gives wonderful, concise explanations of things like plate tectonics, and how a cyclone forms, and the strategy the Mars Rovers used to come down successfully in one piece. I learned here how a turbofan works - for some reason, I had never got around to finding out. He has the best one-sentence summary of quantum mechanics I have ever seen. (""About a hundred years ago, people learned that the idea of 'Where' doesn't always work for very small things""). When you describe things in this unusual way, you can get a different idea of them, and you can think that the big words you normally use are really stopping you from seeing the world instead of helping you see it better. Munroe has a couple of deadpan, helpfully informative pages on nuclear weapons (""Machines for burning cities""). When he gives you a schematic of a Trident submarine (""World-ending boat"") and the history that led up to building this interesting device, it's possible that you may briefly wonder whether it is in fact a good thing.On the last page, Munroe shows you the Tree of Life: the family tree of all the living things there have ever been, who, as he says, are all related to each other. Or, to be exact, he shows you a tiny part of this tree - which really should contain a branch for every creature alive, and the many, many more that used to be alive and are now dead. He asks you to imagine all the grains of sand there are on all the beaches on Earth. And then he asks you to imagine that each of those grains was another whole Earth with its own seas and beaches, and how many grains of sand you would have if you added all those beaches together. Well, that's how many branches you would need to draw if you really drew the Tree of Life.As he says in the book's last sentence: next to the world we are talking about, all our words are small."
3,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31441631-ash,1,"Randall Munroe's XKCD comic is a delight to read, ""What If"" was fabulous, so I was expecting something even more from ""Thing Explainer"". Extremely disappointed. By utilizing only the 1,000 most common words to write this book Munroe created a confusing mess. The simplistic language created a moment or two of cheeky comedy, but for the most part it was a confusing (in the most annoying sense of the term) way to have complex ideas explained. Just call it ""Mitochondria"" and then talk about how it's a ""bag of water full of bags of water with more bags of water."" ::facepalm::"
4,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"One can see how this would easily be a fun exercise, trying to explain some complicated “things” using only the limited set of the “ten hundred” or so most commonly used words in the language. This, along with the xkcd-honed drawing skills, can convert what would otherwise have been quite a nondescript mini-encyclopedia into a quaint and publishable book. Munroe’s cult following, wit, and knack for packaging a book beautifully, makes it a bestseller (?). But as far as reading it is concerned, the novelty wears off around the 4th or 5th “thing”. There on out, we might find ourselves having to reverse translate the strange gibberish of too-easy words. Can’t really see who this book is meant to help. It is not the words that make a book easy or difficult to read, is one thing Munroe manages to demonstrate. The same book without the gimmick might have been genuinely helpful to some college students at least… "
5,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7641172-gerwyn,2,"First off, explaining complex things like the ISS (that's that big thing in the sky, not the men with beards who want to kill you), nuclear reactors, etc using only the most popular 1,000 words in English is one helluva feat, and Randall needs to be lauded for doing that. But...The novelty wears off pretty quickly; it is after all possible to dumb down science too much. The other problem is one of semantics. As I said, it's a great job explaining everything using only a vocabulary of 1,000 words, but while I'm sure Randall has a very clear picture in his head about what he wants to say, it's not always obvious just what he's trying to convey. For example, I never knew the ISS had a ""porch"" and the problem is that I have no idea what its proper name is, which is going to now involve time on the internet finding out. Yes, I suppose that's a good thing, but should I really be looking things up, after reading a book that's supposed to explain things to me.Likewise, it's been 30 years since I was last in a biology class, so when confronted with ""Bags of death water"" I'm a) kinda impressed in a sci-fi kind of way, and b) annoyed because I have absolutely no idea what ""bags of death water"" actually are, thus necessitating another return to Google. Overall, while ""Thing Explainer"" is a good concept, I feel it loses something... no, a lot... in execution.Rather read his ""What If"" - it's funnier and there's more explosions. "
6,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"I have been a long time fan of xkcd, a delightfully nerdy and funny webcomic that has a wonderful mix of science, humor, and the occasional pun. If you like science and humor and aren't reading xkcd you need to zip on over there stat.When I heard that Munroe, the artist/writer of xkcd, announced he was going to put out a book explaining things using his simple, yet elegant art style, I was excited. Here was a person who knew science, had a passion for educating the masses about it, and had a subtle, but wicked sense of humor to help deliver the information. And for the most part I greatly enjoyed the book, all 64 (very, very dense) pages of it. But I felt the book hamstrung itself a bit too much.In the course of trying to make this book as accessible as possible (a good thing!) Munroe limited himself to the thousand most common words in the English language. While I commend his enthusiasm and goal of making the book accessible to the masses I thought this tactic limited the book in several places. This book delves into both the common place (dishwashers, light, elevators) and the complex (nuclear weapons, biological cells, computers), and while it is nice to have components explained in straightforward ways some pieces are just so complex or specialized that using this plain language is either unhelpful or provides a very vague description of what process is occurring.For instance, Munroe typically has to use the word 'water' for liquids and 'air' for all gases. Because they were used in some many places it would be easy for a person to get confused and mistake different kinds of 'water' and 'air'. In these cases the goal of simplifying the language for the masses could easily result in confusion. Maybe if he had upped the number of allowable words to 2,000 or 3,000 things would have been much clearer and probably still as accessible.But that doesn't detract too much from some of the great great art and humor in this book. Munroe has some very straightforward but detailed drawings of the various subjects with some nice little humorous asides or pictures folded in. This book is quite educations and would be a great resource both for children just starting to learn about the world (sort of an updated The Way Things Work) and adults who just want to learn more about the world. Even areas I was already familiar with were shown in a new and humorous light."

I am alternately astounded and unsurprised by my fellow Goodreads reviewers.This is a book where the title on the front is labeled ""Big Words That Tell You What This Book Is."" The inside dust jacket informs you that it uses only the thousand most common words, and even gives you examples like:* food-heating radio boxes (microwaves)* the big flat rocks we live on (tectonic plates)* the bags of stuff inside you (human organs) . . . and yet reviews complain about this exact premise. I mean, there's someone who's kvetching about Munroe referring to helicopters as ""sky boats with turning wings."" That's literally right on the inside dust jacket.People . . .

The premise of the book's right there, on the book and in the Amazon description. If you what something more technical, don't buy Thing Explainer.But I love this.I'm a teacher, so I love using this in class.There's humor (sometimes dark) in the descriptions. I love that atom bombs are ""machines for burning cities.""I love the intellectual puzzle of thinking things through. The back cover says ""Star where people live in a made-up story named after a big pile of sand."" Holy crap, that's a Dune reference. ""Stuff named after a little world named after a god of food kids eat in the morning"" is brilliant: Ceres, cereal, and cerium.I have literally learned things I didn't know about, so it succeeded at the mission statement.It's worth the price of admission just to see Munroe explain the Large Hadron Collider using the thousand most common words in English and a boat metaphor.It's a fun book and a masterwork of a self-imposed language challenge. I've spent entire lunch hours pouring over this, and I undoubtedly will again."
8,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,5,"This book: read it.Randall Munroe never ever fails to make me laugh. Having been indoctrinated to ""internet humor"" at a very young age (okay, so like, my late teens) with xkcd, I was entirely thrilled to learn about What If? being released some nine years after that, and that's still one of the funniest books I've ever read. I wrote a long-form book review about it for my library's newsletter. It's really that good.Thing Explainer is just as good (I hesitate to use the word ""better"" for two reasons - first of all, because What If? is the book I would have written if I were smart enough to write it, which is to say: it is exactly my kind of knowledge delivery system using exactly my kind of humor, and second of all, because Randall Munroe needs to be capped. No one should be allowed to be this funny so for the rest of us we're going to have to level cap his humor, and if I say Thing Explainer is better, than there's no point in living, except to read more Randall Munroe books). It is written using only the one thousand - er, ten hundred - most commonly used words in English (and he includes a list of those words as well as his reasons for using the list that he did), but is written with such a deep understanding of those topics that it's impossible not to understand the concepts he's driving at. And I honest-to-god learned something. Lots of things, actually.My favorite pages in the book were the ""Red World Space Car"" (Mars rover), the ""Food heating radio box"" (microwave), ""The pieces everything is made of"" (periodic table), and of course, the ""Machine for burning cities"" (nuclear bomb). If you didn't laugh once after reading that sentence, this book is not for you and also, we should not be friends.Honestly: I posted so many pictures of so many excerpts of this book on Instagram that I should be sued for copyright infringement. But it really was just that good and I really did want to share it that much. So do yourself a favor: go out and get this book, and open it up to any page, and just read. You'll learn something. And you'll be glad you did."

I actually wanted to learn something from this book, but when nothing is given its proper name it gets super confusing. For instance sky boat with turning wings is a helicopter. The parts are labeled as such: land feet, radio stick, spin changer, pointing wings, end blower, etc etc. Funny, yes. For the first 3 pages. If you are not an engineer and want to grasp the basics with proper nomenclature look elsewhere. "
11,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I really enjoyed this book! (Thanks Kathy!) I will fully admit that I wished for the real names of things to be used, and then explained in simple words, but I still got a kick out of this book. I love Munroe's take on the ""Explain Like I'm 5"" challenge. I now know things, though I'm not sure that it would help me much, for instance, to tell the doctor that my food bag is upset and grumbling. He might refer me to another kind of doctor, one who would make me look at sneeze images made from many armed sea animal secretions and ask how they make me feel. (Answer: Like he should wash his hands.)There's a lot of different things explained in this book, from space boats to shape checkers to the big tiny thing hitter, and it's quite fun to read through, not only for the creative way things are explained, but for the humor inserted here and there throughout, and the little drawing Easter eggs as well. Fun stuff. Maybe not quite as much fun as What If? but still pretty fun."

To my surprise it ended up on the best seller list with the appropriate discount so I snatched it up with an Xmas gift card. Wish I had paid attention to the ""simple words"" part since I should have looked a bit more closely. Turns out the words are, IMHO, too simple. They are drawn from the list of the thousand (sorry ""ten hundred"" in the book's vernacular) most used words and it is the forcing definitions to comply with this guideline that causes me brain pain. Why use ""space boat"" instead of ""space ship""? Because it makes the author laugh. He enjoyed the idea that letting go of complicated language made it impossible to sound dumb since when using terms like ""space boats"" (anything traveling in space) and ""water pushers"" (pumps) it already sounds stupid. Any type of liquid becomes ""water"" - gasoline is ""fire water"", ink is ""writing water"", etc. Frankly, using ""sky boat with turning wings"" for helicopter, ""boat that goes under the sea"" for submarine is overkill in his desire to simplify. I did enjoy the drawings and the concepts but the lack of vocabulary was a major annoyance. So 4 for the pix and concept, 1 for the silliness of the simple words, I'm laying a 2 star rating it."
15,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"Munroe is inspirational for educators who struggle to make complex concepts accessible. I've run into this problem when trying to create fliers to describe, simply and succinctly, the process that you use to check out ebooks from the library. It feels like an impossible task. Munroe shows in this clever book, that anything is possible. From Lifting Rooms (elevators) to Our Star (the sun), Munroe takes it all apart and explains the processes with only ten hundred (1000!) of the most commonly used words in the English language.Every page is a gem, but I particularly loved The Pieces Everything is Made of (The Periodic Table of Elements) pg 47-48 and The US's Laws of the Land (United States Constitution) pg 14.

HELPERSA lot of people helped me with this book. Their namesaren’t words that people use a lot, but I’m going towrite them anyway because they’re important.(...)And, most of all, Strong Pretty Ring-Wearer
It was funny! Even if you couldn't learn anything from it, I think it's worth reading just to see how much more fun and approachable the English language is if we don't gussy it up too much. The ten hundred words list. It's actually quite cool to have a look at that list and imagine all the things I couldn't explain using what's on there. Like GR - I couldn't explain how to write a review with just the words on that list, so it takes mad skill (and, I guess, a Physics degree and experience in robotics at NASA) for Mr Munroe to explain actual smart people things using only those words and pictures.Thinking on it, I don't even know what one of these < is called, so I'd be screwed from the get go.Already mentioned the acknowledgements page.The Things in this Book by Page page. That was actually really helpful for my dumb ass, because with some of the things he was describing I straight up had no idea what the thing even was. Case in point:

Machine for burning cities
Do you know what that is? (view spoiler)[Nuclear bomb. (hide spoiler)]

Big tiny thing hitter
(view spoiler)[Large Hadron Collider. (hide spoiler)]So my ass needed the translations in the Table of Contents. Much appreciated, Mr Munroe.The Periodic Table went way over my head - I had to read it with a copy of the actual periodic table up on my phone, or I would have had no idea what he was describing. Except the Ag and Au ones, because I knows my coin.Also, I wish it was longer.Just ordered a few more hardback copies for the people I love. This is a great, clever, quirky read and it makes me feel a little smug because I didn't read only dirty, smutty goodness today."

Randall Munroe, the author of the book, intentionally use simplified words to give equivalents or to explain, which is here and there a bit confusing. The idea is that if you truly understand something you can break it down into simple words enough for anyone to understand.Thing explainer is also written with a sarcastic sense of humour and it includes some lighter comics, as well as, witty asides along with the more in-depth diagrams and explanations clearly and funny labelled.So if you're interested in how things work this book basically has lots of diagrams with lots of description of how it works. If you struggled to understand each and every element on the Periodic Table or if you tried and failed to explain how a computer works to your children or grandparents than grab this book. Thing Explainer is a kind of encyclopedia for kids, full of hand-made pictures, arrows, and descriptions. I really liked the layout and a bit childish style of everything in the book.You could definitely use any of the pages of the book as a sort of starting point for a bigger exploration of any concept. Then, you can look through and see if you’d like to go further on or maybe let your children pick out what they're interested in.Unfortunately, due to the fact that many pictures are gigantic and cover both pages, the book is inconvenient to read on a Kindle or other handy...

It's amazing the amount of understanding he distilled into informative and approachable drawings. I got tired of the 1,000-word schtick (the author only uses the 1,000 most common words in the English language, so e.g. helicopters are called ""sky boats with turning wings""), though it's admittedly impressive.

Forty-seven Things are described in easy, simple words. With easy, simple pictures. In 61 legal-sized pages. These Things range from objects mechanical to biological to geographical to electrical to chemical to medical to astronomical. And many other Things in between. I think I learnt a lot reading about Things. But I don’t seem to remember much. Especially after I closed the book. And sometimes even before. Maybe a name for each part will help. But that would be too many words. This is not that kind of book. Perhaps I can pin a picture of the Thing next to the real Thing. That will help me remember what does what. The picture of The Room That Helps People will show that this drawer has stuff that helps kids breathe. And that drawer has stuff for cleaning. The picture will help me not use stuff for cleaning to help kids breathe. I really like the picture of Shared Space House. When I grow up, I want a room with a beautiful view of the earth. And never, ever go into space naked. At the People Door, you will need to put on space clothes before going through, or you’ll die.I love animals. Especially those with bones. The picture of Animals with Bones tells me that my Lucy was a… long bitey dog? Or smelly dog? Or river dog? Or tiny screaming dog? Or animal with hair? Or animal eater? This picture is no help. I will fail zoology. Let’s try this picture, The Pieces Everything is Made Of. It has a table with lots of squares. This square is for stuff we cannot breathe or we die. That square is for stuff that lasts for two minutes. Next to it is a square for stuff that lasts for one minute. And two squares up on the right is for gray matter we don’t find much of. I think I will also fail chemistry. But this is not that kind of book either. However, this is a book for all ages. If you are 5-years old, you will learn about Things explained in big words (for you). You will feel like a big boy (or girl). If you are 100-years old, you will learn about Things explained in small words that you can tell 5-year old children and they will think you know a lot about Things. (The light blue text might kill your eyes though but hey, you will still look smart). Or, if you are like me who is not old, not young, but is super curious about Things and likes to be amused with super fun books, then go read it.[words in italics are phrases from book]... And I used to want to sit in this."
22,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh,4,"Randall Munroe's (of xkcd and what if? fame) latest attempt is to explain things using only the most common 1000 words. This is a crazy, crazy read. I had to do two completely opposite things here: 1) be thorough in the subject matter, and 2) be able to unlearn everything about the subject. It's a little disorienting at first and I was feeling my way across, almost like reading a foreign language I was just starting to grasp. I actually took some time, in most cases more than one reading of the sentence/passage (and this was supposed to be a quick read) to understand what he's talking about, and appreciate the beauty of what he's attempting.Allow me to also give a head's up that, despite what the title implies, the book is pretty useless if you're actually looking to learn about something only from here. If you already know the subject then it's a nice fun read, as you hang the various pieces of information onto your existing mental hooks. If you know nothing about the subject, then it's kind of a starting point where you just get a (very) general idea. But for the majority of the subjects where your knowledge is basic and half-forgotten and you're grasping your memory for the actual names and terms (as I was), may the force be with you. This exasperation is the most fun part of the book though, and is beautiful. Beautiful as in reading poetry: you're here not for the content, as much as for the writing.That being said, I do wish there had been an index on each page, with the actual words and terms, to go with Munro's typically subtle but wicked humour. The book is in the form of layout diagrams for each subject, and he explains each component, thus adding to the whole. He delves into both the common (pencils, locks, trees, etc) and the complex (the International Space Station, biological cells, nuclear subs, the Large Hadron Collider, etc) and there were times where I had no idea what was going on, such as: 
The strange thing is, no one tells the part where to go. It just falls out into the room with all the other parts, and hangs around until it runs into whatever part it’s supposed to grab. (Or until another part grabs it!) This sounds strange, and it is! There are so many parts, and they’re all grabbing each other and stopping each other and helping each other.
Overall, I did have fun though, pulling up wikipedia and breaking jail on my memory cells, and with a reinforced respect for names and words."
23,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/283407-crowinator,4,"I have to be honest - I didn't read every word in this beautiful book. I pored over the amazingly detailed illustrations, skimmed over some (too much) of the text, and chuckled over the snarky comic asides, while wishing that Munroe had maybe used some of the real, technical words to define things, then explained them in his simplified terms. His simplified terms and definitions were frequently hilarious, but they were also much more confusing. For example, the spread on bridges (or ""tall roads"") taught me A LOT about the reasons for the different architectural designs, but I couldn't take away as much from some of the other sections, like an explanation of all the elements in the periodic table (""the pieces everything is made of""), without having the real terms to refer to. (The periodic table section is still my favorite, full of so many little jokes and smart, memorable explanations -- I just needed to refer to a real periodic table at the same time to make it mean something.) I admire his total commitment to his conceit, and this is undeniably a fun, intelligent reading/viewing experience, but maybe an index of terms at the back? End notes? In-text citations? Something more to give the really, really awesome diagrams more context. Maybe that means I'm missing the point in a humorless way (after all, I could always Google what's inside a washing machine if I really wanted to know what all the pieces are called and then put that together with Munroe's simplified explanations), but I feel this was still a missed opportunity to actually explain how things work.Still love it though -- still buying it for people as Christmas presents -- still (maybe) buying it for myself so I can spend more time with it since I had to return it to the library (or maybe going back on the holds list)."
24,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22379326-karen,1,"The premise of this book is to explain complicated things using only the most common 1000 words (ten hundred words). A pencil becomes a 'writing stick' and a camera a 'picture taker.' So, you might understand in very basic terms how something like the International Space Station works (not really) but you won't have the appropriate language to refer to anything about it. I find this incredibly frustrating and a waste of time. If you like knowing how something works but not being able to talk about it with anyone else who knows how it works (unless they know how it works from reading this book!), then this is the book for you. If you enjoy engaging your knowledge with the knowledge of others, read something else! (You are probably wondering why this lover of language read this book? I was hoping to understand some complicated things and didn't realize the premise of the book until way too long after I started. To anyone who has read this book, that will seem ridiculous, but I just thought the author was trying to explain things in really basic language that anyone could understand. I hated it before I realized the premise and I still hate it and don't understand why it was necessary anyway.)"

The premise of the book is that the author tries to explain complicated stuff using the 1000 most commonly used words in the English vocabulary, which means he has to do away with all technical jargon and have a real ELI5 (Explain Like I am 5) approach to describing and explaining the inner workings of things, which ranges from how weather works, to the inner workings of a washing machine, from the human body to an internal combustion engine. Peppered with his usual dose of subtle humour and his omnipresent nerdy stick figures, the book is fun! The premise doesn't seem gimmicky and it manages to hold your attention even for things that you are familiar with. The illustrations are beautiful, with a good attention to detail, and some of the full-page and poster-size ones are grand. I have the hardcover edition with a few fold-away pages which make it a collector's item. Also, it would make a great gift to kids, especially who are curious about science and this can potentially open the floodgates to learning and exploring more about the world around us. The book really took me back to my days peering over encyclopedias and colour atlases in the school library, and it was a burst of nostagia for the good old days of pre-internet learning and looking up stuff in books rather than having all the information at our disposal a couple of clicks away."

The result is amazingly thought-provoking; first of all, you begin to search for Wikipedia entries for some of the facts he mentions (like the naturally occurring nuclear fission that happened at least once somewhere in Africa — quite long ago, of course); second, you admire his skill in explaining complex facts and historical events (the map of the world, with references to Darwin and Napoleon, is especially precious); but most importantly, this manner of speaking produces lots of new meanings, and really makes you think twice, both about things you knew and the things you didn't. For a child or an adult, an equally instructive and fascinating read. Munroe is definitely one of the smartest people of the generation."

So, naturally, I wanted to check out this other book.Great concept but I did not like the execution for the following reasons: 1. The text was difficult to read. Light blue, vivid text on white background. Small letters. White text on dark blue background (but written over white stars every now and then). There was no intuitive place to start and stop reading on the page (so I guess I wasnt a fan of the layout?). 2. The writing itself. Instead of gasoline, he said ""fire water"". And you had to play some mental gymnastics to figure out the normal word he was trying to convey. Example: WINDOW CLEANING WATER HOLE: If you run out of cleaning water, you can pour more in here. WINDOW CLEANING WATER: This holds the water that pours onto your windows when you pull on the cleaning control. Way too many words to describe something that is really not that interesting .... This book was not for me. Might be ideal for someone a little younger and quicker mind. "

34,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"I'm so torn on my review of this book. On the one hand, Randall Munroe is an incredibly creative, intelligent, and gifted writer. He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all. All in all, I'm proud and happy with my book, and while I will continue to actively endorse What If? as a book for most people, this book becomes more of a side note to a conversation. "
35,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"I would have loved having this book as a child, since i could never remember the correct names/words for some well known things and found my own ways to name/describe them. This book? This would have been perfect for me. Its not a book in the traditional sense that you read. Its just entertaining to flip through, look through, read a section of it, be entertained by seeing so many well known things explained in much simpler terms. The drawings are great in my option as well, they are ""cute"" enough to be nice for children to look through but ""adult"" enough that older people flipping through the book won't find it childish. This is a great book for everyone that loves learning, enjoys a different version of doing so and likes being entertained!"
36,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,3,"I didn't like this nearly as much as his What if?. That's kind of strange, considering that the content of this book is a lot closer to the format and content of his webcomic than the other is.It's fun, it's quirky - yet I had a lot of trouble reading more than a page or two of it at a time.I do kind of agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the language was perhaps dumbed down a bit too much. There were a few moments where I was absolutely baffled by the name of something even though I knew exactly what was being discussed. I think a good addition might be a page by page glossary at the end of the book to give the more technical names for things. It would have given a bit more clarity if you were confused by his round-about ways of describing things, but it also would make it a lot easier to look up more information about a topic you're interested in.Another thing that slightly annoyed me is that this book is NOT well-served by being available electronically. What If actually crashed my Paperwhite repeatedly - until I gave up and went and got my tablet so I wasn't too surprised that Thing Explainer was limited to just tablets and PC software.Unfortunately, the this is composed solely of image files - no straight text, and those images are sized appropriately for a large format Hardback. My 8"" tablet screen just isn't big enough to display more than half a page at any given time - and much less than that if it is a double-page image. To read this on a tablet, you have to do a LOT of panning and zooming, and frequently have to pause to wait for a higher resolution picture to load. It got old quickly.And, unfortunately, the Kindle software just doesn't work properly on my computer, so I wasn't' able to switch to my much larger monitor to view a whole page at a time.I'd still recommend a paper copy of this book if you're a fan of the webcomic, though. It'd be a fun coffee table book to pick up and glance at every once in awhile. It's just that some books are better in paper."
37,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975036-kris,5,"The title pretty much says it all. Some of the simple words were so simple that I really had to look at the thing being explained to figure out what it was, for example, a ""Food Heating Radio Box"" is a microwave oven. Good explanations, and usually entertaining. My favorite was the Tree of Life, where the different types of life on earth are shown in relationship to each other and again, the reader sometimes has to figure out what type of being is named with the simple words (""biter with eight legs"" is a spider). Go read it!"
38,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"Several years ago, xkcd featured a comic about ""Upgoer Five"", a diagram of the Saturn rocket explained entirely in the top thousand most used words. (This is most well-known for the concluding sentence ""If it starts pointing at space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today."") This is an entire book of that. Munroe explains things as diverse as the composition of pencils and the composition of the interior of a star in incredibly over-simplified language. It's funny and thought-provoking. A note: this is not this decade's The Way Things Work--in fact, if you don't already have a rough idea of how these things work, you will not actually understand any of this. You need at least a working knowledge of freshman year chemistry, physics, astronomy, and more. What it is good for is making you think about the things that you kind of vaguely know about and either have forgotten or never quite got, and making sure you actually turn it around in your brain enough to make things click. (For example, I had to pull up an actual copy of the periodic table to make heads or tails of the periodic table page, but then it was very funny. And I learned about some properties and history I hadn't known before.) It's a puzzle, in which you try to figure out what the real words that he's not using should be, how that all plays into his explanations, and then translate it out again to get the joke. It's delightful for nerds. I would not bother having my son read it until at least halfway through high school."

Plain language is a good thing - and yes, Munroe's work here is laudable! - but call a 'cell' a cell - not ""tiny bags of water you're made of""...and then it just keeps going from there. For some processes like weather, plate tectonics, and even how a washing machine works, it was pretty interesting, but when describing a nuclear reactor, there are just some words you need to say. His dedication to plain language (extremely plain language) makes every page very wordy. To avoid saying one word, he has to use a whole phrase to describe - and it's just a jumble. And while the illustrations are well done and fun to study, all of the wordy descriptions and arrows bring flashbacks of A Beautiful Mind.Still, worth picking up and flipping through - it's very entertaining, and I learned several things from it.

The language limitation forced him to come up with roundabout and, in many ways, easier to understand explanations for common things.

48,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

However, you know there are many, many books with the same premise.

But even forgiving the formatting through e-books, this book... missed the mark. Generally I enjoyed the explanations where I understood what was being explained with a wink and a nod, such as the topics about biology. I could infer what the author was saying and it was sort like 'haha... that is rather amusing.' As for the topics where I was unfamiliar... they could be pretty frustrating. This time I was not 'in on' the joke, so sometimes I had no idea what was going on and had to do my best to decipher what he was trying to say. It was more frustrating than anything. There were a few topics where the simplistic explanations really worked. These were generally for less complex machines/ concepts. For example, I enjoyed learning how a padlock works without the fancy terminology. I also liked the oil rig, ship, and constitution examples. Had the author vetted the book in choosing more simple concepts it would have been a better use of my time.

I wish he would put the real word for what it is instead of something silly. I feel like I’m learning something but then I don’t know what the real word for the item he is describing is.

The chapter on the surface of the earth mentioned various interesting facts, but since it doesn't mention any names, looking it up online is difficult.

The overall tone was condescending, treating the reader as if they are the toddler cousin you got stuck with babysitting one night who was genuinely interested in learning about what you do all day, but you lacked the ability unable to stop being an asshole about the situation long enough to try and recognize or engage a willing audience. For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell."" That's the goal of the book and it falls so short of its intention as a cutesy teaching tool because it fails to treat its audience with any kind of respect. "

Light blue, vivid text on white background. Small letters. White text on dark blue background (but written over white stars every now and then). There was no intuitive place to start and stop reading on the page (so I guess I wasnt a fan of the layout?). 2. The writing itself. Instead of gasoline, he said ""fire water"". And you had to play some mental gymnastics to figure out the normal word he was trying to convey. Example: WINDOW CLEANING WATER HOLE: If you run out of cleaning water, you can pour more in here. WINDOW CLEANING WATER: This holds the water that pours onto your windows when you pull on the cleaning control. Way too many words to describe something that is really not that interesting ....

64,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"I'm so torn on my review of this book. On the one hand, Randall Munroe is an incredibly creative, intelligent, and gifted writer. He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all. All in all, I'm proud and happy with my book, and while I will continue to actively endorse What If? as a book for most people, this book becomes more of a side note to a conversation. "
65,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"I would have loved having this book as a child, since i could never remember the correct names/words for some well known things and found my own ways to name/describe them. This book? This would have been perfect for me. Its not a book in the traditional sense that you read. Its just entertaining to flip through, look through, read a section of it, be entertained by seeing so many well known things explained in much simpler terms. The drawings are great in my option as well, they are ""cute"" enough to be nice for children to look through but ""adult"" enough that older people flipping through the book won't find it childish. This is a great book for everyone that loves learning, enjoys a different version of doing so and likes being entertained!"
66,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,3,"I didn't like this nearly as much as his What if?. That's kind of strange, considering that the content of this book is a lot closer to the format and content of his webcomic than the other is.It's fun, it's quirky - yet I had a lot of trouble reading more than a page or two of it at a time.I do kind of agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the language was perhaps dumbed down a bit too much. There were a few moments where I was absolutely baffled by the name of something even though I knew exactly what was being discussed. I think a good addition might be a page by page glossary at the end of the book to give the more technical names for things. It would have given a bit more clarity if you were confused by his round-about ways of describing things, but it also would make it a lot easier to look up more information about a topic you're interested in.Another thing that slightly annoyed me is that this book is NOT well-served by being available electronically. What If actually crashed my Paperwhite repeatedly - until I gave up and went and got my tablet so I wasn't too surprised that Thing Explainer was limited to just tablets and PC software.Unfortunately, the this is composed solely of image files - no straight text, and those images are sized appropriately for a large format Hardback. My 8"" tablet screen just isn't big enough to display more than half a page at any given time - and much less than that if it is a double-page image. To read this on a tablet, you have to do a LOT of panning and zooming, and frequently have to pause to wait for a higher resolution picture to load. It got old quickly.And, unfortunately, the Kindle software just doesn't work properly on my computer, so I wasn't' able to switch to my much larger monitor to view a whole page at a time.I'd still recommend a paper copy of this book if you're a fan of the webcomic, though. It'd be a fun coffee table book to pick up and glance at every once in awhile. It's just that some books are better in paper."
67,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975036-kris,5,"The title pretty much says it all. Some of the simple words were so simple that I really had to look at the thing being explained to figure out what it was, for example, a ""Food Heating Radio Box"" is a microwave oven. Good explanations, and usually entertaining. My favorite was the Tree of Life, where the different types of life on earth are shown in relationship to each other and again, the reader sometimes has to figure out what type of being is named with the simple words (""biter with eight legs"" is a spider). Go read it!"
68,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"Several years ago, xkcd featured a comic about ""Upgoer Five"", a diagram of the Saturn rocket explained entirely in the top thousand most used words. (This is most well-known for the concluding sentence ""If it starts pointing at space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today."") This is an entire book of that. Munroe explains things as diverse as the composition of pencils and the composition of the interior of a star in incredibly over-simplified language. It's funny and thought-provoking. A note: this is not this decade's The Way Things Work--in fact, if you don't already have a rough idea of how these things work, you will not actually understand any of this. You need at least a working knowledge of freshman year chemistry, physics, astronomy, and more. What it is good for is making you think about the things that you kind of vaguely know about and either have forgotten or never quite got, and making sure you actually turn it around in your brain enough to make things click. (For example, I had to pull up an actual copy of the periodic table to make heads or tails of the periodic table page, but then it was very funny. And I learned about some properties and history I hadn't known before.) It's a puzzle, in which you try to figure out what the real words that he's not using should be, how that all plays into his explanations, and then translate it out again to get the joke. It's delightful for nerds. I would not bother having my son read it until at least halfway through high school."

Plain language is a good thing - and yes, Munroe's work here is laudable! - but call a 'cell' a cell - not ""tiny bags of water you're made of""...and then it just keeps going from there. For some processes like weather, plate tectonics, and even how a washing machine works, it was pretty interesting, but when describing a nuclear reactor, there are just some words you need to say. His dedication to plain language (extremely plain language) makes every page very wordy. To avoid saying one word, he has to use a whole phrase to describe - and it's just a jumble. And while the illustrations are well done and fun to study, all of the wordy descriptions and arrows bring flashbacks of A Beautiful Mind.Still, worth picking up and flipping through - it's very entertaining, and I learned several things from it.

78,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

But even forgiving the formatting through e-books, this book... missed the mark. Generally I enjoyed the explanations where I understood what was being explained with a wink and a nod, such as the topics about biology. I could infer what the author was saying and it was sort like 'haha... that is rather amusing.' As for the topics where I was unfamiliar... they could be pretty frustrating. This time I was not 'in on' the joke, so sometimes I had no idea what was going on and had to do my best to decipher what he was trying to say. It was more frustrating than anything. There were a few topics where the simplistic explanations really worked. These were generally for less complex machines/ concepts. For example, I enjoyed learning how a padlock works without the fancy terminology. I also liked the oil rig, ship, and constitution examples. Had the author vetted the book in choosing more simple concepts it would have been a better use of my time.

If a 3 year old can understand language and concepts such as space shuttle (vs. flying space truck) and the names of organs in the human body such as bladder (vs. yellow water holder), I would assume most individuals literate enough to the read the book would as well."

For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell.""

There was no intuitive place to start and stop reading on the page (so I guess I wasnt a fan of the layout?). 2. The writing itself. Instead of gasoline, he said ""fire water"". And you had to play some mental gymnastics to figure out the normal word he was trying to convey. Example: WINDOW CLEANING WATER HOLE: If you run out of cleaning water, you can pour more in here. WINDOW CLEANING WATER: This holds the water that pours onto your windows when you pull on the cleaning control. Way too many words to describe something that is really not that interesting ....

94,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"I'm so torn on my review of this book. On the one hand, Randall Munroe is an incredibly creative, intelligent, and gifted writer. He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all. All in all, I'm proud and happy with my book, and while I will continue to actively endorse What If? as a book for most people, this book becomes more of a side note to a conversation. "
95,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"I would have loved having this book as a child, since i could never remember the correct names/words for some well known things and found my own ways to name/describe them. This book? This would have been perfect for me. Its not a book in the traditional sense that you read. Its just entertaining to flip through, look through, read a section of it, be entertained by seeing so many well known things explained in much simpler terms. The drawings are great in my option as well, they are ""cute"" enough to be nice for children to look through but ""adult"" enough that older people flipping through the book won't find it childish. This is a great book for everyone that loves learning, enjoys a different version of doing so and likes being entertained!"
96,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,3,"I didn't like this nearly as much as his What if?. That's kind of strange, considering that the content of this book is a lot closer to the format and content of his webcomic than the other is.It's fun, it's quirky - yet I had a lot of trouble reading more than a page or two of it at a time.I do kind of agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the language was perhaps dumbed down a bit too much. There were a few moments where I was absolutely baffled by the name of something even though I knew exactly what was being discussed. I think a good addition might be a page by page glossary at the end of the book to give the more technical names for things. It would have given a bit more clarity if you were confused by his round-about ways of describing things, but it also would make it a lot easier to look up more information about a topic you're interested in.Another thing that slightly annoyed me is that this book is NOT well-served by being available electronically. What If actually crashed my Paperwhite repeatedly - until I gave up and went and got my tablet so I wasn't too surprised that Thing Explainer was limited to just tablets and PC software.Unfortunately, the this is composed solely of image files - no straight text, and those images are sized appropriately for a large format Hardback. My 8"" tablet screen just isn't big enough to display more than half a page at any given time - and much less than that if it is a double-page image. To read this on a tablet, you have to do a LOT of panning and zooming, and frequently have to pause to wait for a higher resolution picture to load. It got old quickly.And, unfortunately, the Kindle software just doesn't work properly on my computer, so I wasn't' able to switch to my much larger monitor to view a whole page at a time.I'd still recommend a paper copy of this book if you're a fan of the webcomic, though. It'd be a fun coffee table book to pick up and glance at every once in awhile. It's just that some books are better in paper."
97,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975036-kris,5,"The title pretty much says it all. Some of the simple words were so simple that I really had to look at the thing being explained to figure out what it was, for example, a ""Food Heating Radio Box"" is a microwave oven. Good explanations, and usually entertaining. My favorite was the Tree of Life, where the different types of life on earth are shown in relationship to each other and again, the reader sometimes has to figure out what type of being is named with the simple words (""biter with eight legs"" is a spider). Go read it!"
98,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"Several years ago, xkcd featured a comic about ""Upgoer Five"", a diagram of the Saturn rocket explained entirely in the top thousand most used words. (This is most well-known for the concluding sentence ""If it starts pointing at space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today."") This is an entire book of that. Munroe explains things as diverse as the composition of pencils and the composition of the interior of a star in incredibly over-simplified language. It's funny and thought-provoking. A note: this is not this decade's The Way Things Work--in fact, if you don't already have a rough idea of how these things work, you will not actually understand any of this. You need at least a working knowledge of freshman year chemistry, physics, astronomy, and more. What it is good for is making you think about the things that you kind of vaguely know about and either have forgotten or never quite got, and making sure you actually turn it around in your brain enough to make things click. (For example, I had to pull up an actual copy of the periodic table to make heads or tails of the periodic table page, but then it was very funny. And I learned about some properties and history I hadn't known before.) It's a puzzle, in which you try to figure out what the real words that he's not using should be, how that all plays into his explanations, and then translate it out again to get the joke. It's delightful for nerds. I would not bother having my son read it until at least halfway through high school."

Plain language is a good thing - and yes, Munroe's work here is laudable! - but call a 'cell' a cell - not ""tiny bags of water you're made of""...and then it just keeps going from there. For some processes like weather, plate tectonics, and even how a washing machine works, it was pretty interesting, but when describing a nuclear reactor, there are just some words you need to say. His dedication to plain language (extremely plain language) makes every page very wordy. To avoid saying one word, he has to use a whole phrase to describe - and it's just a jumble. And while the illustrations are well done and fun to study, all of the wordy descriptions and arrows bring flashbacks of A Beautiful Mind.Still, worth picking up and flipping through - it's very entertaining, and I learned several things from it.

108,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

However, you know there are many, many books with the same premise. Author's solution: Write a book about how stuff works, but insist on no vocabulary and simple language and attempt for it to be humorousI will preface this review by saying that I was stuck reading this thing on Overdrive and my laptop and this is a book that is meant to be read on paper. But even forgiving the formatting through e-books, this book... missed the mark. Generally I enjoyed the explanations where I understood what was being explained with a wink and a nod, such as the topics about biology. I could infer what the author was saying and it was sort like 'haha... that is rather amusing.' As for the topics where I was unfamiliar... they could be pretty frustrating. This time I was not 'in on' the joke, so sometimes I had no idea what was going on and had to do my best to decipher what he was trying to say. It was more frustrating than anything. There were a few topics where the simplistic explanations really worked. These were generally for less complex machines/ concepts. For example, I enjoyed learning how a padlock works without the fancy terminology. I also liked the oil rig, ship, and constitution examples. Had the author vetted the book in choosing more simple concepts it would have been a better use of my time. In general, while a creative and clearly very thoughtful effort, I'm not sure this concept really worked for me. "

It's great for some laughs and a few reads, but it's nearly impossible to seriously gain knowledge from.I have some ""How Stuff Works"" books that I read when I was around 12 and I understood much more from those than I did in Thing Explainer.Ultimately the judgment of this book depends on what you perceive its goal as: Either it's a joke book made for laughs (not likely given the research required to write it), or it's a legitimate attempt to explain things (more likely given that's literally the title).If Thing Explainer's goal is truly to explain things, it has failed."

There's great range: it covers stuff from pencils to nuclear bombs to classics like the solar system and the history of life. The serious part: I think there's a degree of simplicity to describing things in simple words, a la ""Pale Bale Dot"" or a sky full of stars: it makes all our egos and tribalism and anxieties seem small. It reminds us that life is a pretty simple thing, if you don't make it complicated.Four stars for the occasional use of a frequent word with an infrequent meaning, for ""nine"" not making the ten hundred most popular list, and for the ungooglability of some of the stuff I wanted to learn more about (because, hey, good luck searching by anything than the official scientific name).

In fact, knowing the jargon of space and Physics in general actually hampered me, and at times reading in the most layman language I had to think for a minute which scientific object did author really meant.The thing is, you won't read the entire book in one sitting. I don't think you actually can. Even though it is written in the lamest of language, the science stuff is still heavy. Don't get me wrong. That doesn't mean that the book is dense, quite the opposite. It is just that you don't want to go through all that information in one go.

He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all.

This book? This would have been perfect for me. Its not a book in the traditional sense that you read. Its just entertaining to flip through, look through, read a section of it, be entertained by seeing so many well known things explained in much simpler terms. The drawings are great in my option as well, they are ""cute"" enough to be nice for children to look through but ""adult"" enough that older people flipping through the book won't find it childish.

That's kind of strange, considering that the content of this book is a lot closer to the format and content of his webcomic than the other is.It's fun, it's quirky - yet I had a lot of trouble reading more than a page or two of it at a time.I do kind of agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the language was perhaps dumbed down a bit too much. There were a few moments where I was absolutely baffled by the name of something even though I knew exactly what was being discussed. I think a good addition might be a page by page glossary at the end of the book to give the more technical names for things. It would have given a bit more clarity if you were confused by his round-about ways of describing things, but it also would make it a lot easier to look up more information about a topic you're interested in.Another thing that slightly annoyed me is that this book is NOT well-served by being available electronically. What If actually crashed my Paperwhite repeatedly - until I gave up and went and got my tablet so I wasn't too surprised that Thing Explainer was limited to just tablets and PC software.Unfortunately, the this is composed solely of image files - no straight text, and those images are sized appropriately for a large format Hardback. My 8"" tablet screen just isn't big enough to display more than half a page at any given time - and much less than that if it is a double-page image. To read this on a tablet, you have to do a LOT of panning and zooming, and frequently have to pause to wait for a higher resolution picture to load. It got old quickly.And, unfortunately, the Kindle software just doesn't work properly on my computer, so I wasn't' able to switch to my much larger monitor to view a whole page at a time.I'd still recommend a paper copy of this book if you're a fan of the webcomic, though. It'd be a fun coffee table book to pick up and glance at every once in awhile. It's just that some books are better in paper."
127,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975036-kris,5,"The title pretty much says it all. Some of the simple words were so simple that I really had to look at the thing being explained to figure out what it was, for example, a ""Food Heating Radio Box"" is a microwave oven. Good explanations, and usually entertaining. My favorite was the Tree of Life, where the different types of life on earth are shown in relationship to each other and again, the reader sometimes has to figure out what type of being is named with the simple words (""biter with eight legs"" is a spider). Go read it!"
128,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"Several years ago, xkcd featured a comic about ""Upgoer Five"", a diagram of the Saturn rocket explained entirely in the top thousand most used words. (This is most well-known for the concluding sentence ""If it starts pointing at space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today."") This is an entire book of that. Munroe explains things as diverse as the composition of pencils and the composition of the interior of a star in incredibly over-simplified language. It's funny and thought-provoking. A note: this is not this decade's The Way Things Work--in fact, if you don't already have a rough idea of how these things work, you will not actually understand any of this. You need at least a working knowledge of freshman year chemistry, physics, astronomy, and more. What it is good for is making you think about the things that you kind of vaguely know about and either have forgotten or never quite got, and making sure you actually turn it around in your brain enough to make things click. (For example, I had to pull up an actual copy of the periodic table to make heads or tails of the periodic table page, but then it was very funny. And I learned about some properties and history I hadn't known before.) It's a puzzle, in which you try to figure out what the real words that he's not using should be, how that all plays into his explanations, and then translate it out again to get the joke. It's delightful for nerds. I would not bother having my son read it until at least halfway through high school."

Plain language is a good thing - and yes, Munroe's work here is laudable! - but call a 'cell' a cell - not ""tiny bags of water you're made of""...and then it just keeps going from there. For some processes like weather, plate tectonics, and even how a washing machine works, it was pretty interesting, but when describing a nuclear reactor, there are just some words you need to say. His dedication to plain language (extremely plain language) makes every page very wordy. To avoid saying one word, he has to use a whole phrase to describe - and it's just a jumble. And while the illustrations are well done and fun to study, all of the wordy descriptions and arrows bring flashbacks of A Beautiful Mind.Still, worth picking up and flipping through - it's very entertaining, and I learned several things from it.

The language limitation forced him to come up with roundabout and, in many ways, easier to understand explanations for common things. I especially loved the fact that 9 is not in the top 1000 words, so it was always called ""the one after 8"" or ""almost ten."" Very clever. This is just a big, fun, smart, silly book worth reading.

138,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

However, you know there are many, many books with the same premise. Author's solution: Write a book about how stuff works, but insist on no vocabulary and simple language and attempt for it to be humorousI will preface this review by saying that I was stuck reading this thing on Overdrive and my laptop and this is a book that is meant to be read on paper. But even forgiving the formatting through e-books, this book... missed the mark. Generally I enjoyed the explanations where I understood what was being explained with a wink and a nod, such as the topics about biology. I could infer what the author was saying and it was sort like 'haha... that is rather amusing.' As for the topics where I was unfamiliar... they could be pretty frustrating. This time I was not 'in on' the joke, so sometimes I had no idea what was going on and had to do my best to decipher what he was trying to say. It was more frustrating than anything. There were a few topics where the simplistic explanations really worked. These were generally for less complex machines/ concepts. For example, I enjoyed learning how a padlock works without the fancy terminology. I also liked the oil rig, ship, and constitution examples. Had the author vetted the book in choosing more simple concepts it would have been a better use of my time. In general, while a creative and clearly very thoughtful effort, I'm not sure this concept really worked for me. "

It's great for some laughs and a few reads, but it's nearly impossible to seriously gain knowledge from.I have some ""How Stuff Works"" books that I read when I was around 12 and I understood much more from those than I did in Thing Explainer.Ultimately the judgment of this book depends on what you perceive its goal as: Either it's a joke book made for laughs (not likely given the research required to write it), or it's a legitimate attempt to explain things (more likely given that's literally the title).If Thing Explainer's goal is truly to explain things, it has failed."

It's insightful, funny (""space boats"") and whimsical (the occasional people fencing in the corner of an illustration; rabbits being ""long-ear jumpers""; hedgehogs being ""pointy cats""). There's great range: it covers stuff from pencils to nuclear bombs to classics like the solar system and the history of life. The serious part: I think there's a degree of simplicity to describing things in simple words, a la ""Pale Bale Dot"" or a sky full of stars: it makes all our egos and tribalism and anxieties seem small. It reminds us that life is a pretty simple thing, if you don't make it complicated.Four stars for the occasional use of a frequent word with an infrequent meaning, for ""nine"" not making the ten hundred most popular list, and for the ungooglability of some of the stuff I wanted to learn more about (because, hey, good luck searching by anything than the official scientific name). Which is entirely within the author's stated intention, but I'm going to be a fickle reader and exact revenge on him anyway."

The ingenuity which author used to describe the most arcane of things is just amazing.It is fun to read, especially when you have no scientific idea about the thing being described. In fact, knowing the jargon of space and Physics in general actually hampered me, and at times reading in the most layman language I had to think for a minute which scientific object did author really meant.The thing is, you won't read the entire book in one sitting. I don't think you actually can. Even though it is written in the lamest of language, the science stuff is still heavy. Don't get me wrong. That doesn't mean that the book is dense, quite the opposite. It is just that you don't want to go through all that information in one go. So sit with the book and a friend, every once in a while, choose a topic and laugh your ass off as you encounter the author's brilliance and innovation! :D"

However, even in those simple explanations, they use the appropriate terminology and define it. I couldn’t get past the cutesy words used in this. I thought it might be fun to read it with my very curious 3 year old, but I found myself searching for ways to translate it into the more complex language and proper terminology she understands. If a 3 year old can understand language and concepts such as space shuttle (vs. flying space truck) and the names of organs in the human body such as bladder (vs. yellow water holder), I would assume most individuals literate enough to the read the book would as well."

Things can sometimes be explained simply, but often there is a hidden depth and complexity that requires not just specialist language and more explanation, but acknowledgement that some things cannot be simplified without loosing some meaning, depth, or specificity. The aims of this book were noble and in some respects successful, with the humour coming through well. I was however frustrated in other aspects, where meaning was sacrificed for the sake of supposed simplicity, rendering surface level information presented."

I wish he would put the real word for what it is instead of something silly. I feel like I’m learning something but then I don’t know what the real word for the item he is describing is.

So, I was mesmerized by this book for managing to do that. Cannot recommend it enough! It's great! "

For eg. The chapter on the surface of the earth mentioned various interesting facts, but since it doesn't mention any names, looking it up online is difficult.

The overall tone was condescending, treating the reader as if they are the toddler cousin you got stuck with babysitting one night who was genuinely interested in learning about what you do all day, but you lacked the ability unable to stop being an asshole about the situation long enough to try and recognize or engage a willing audience. For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell."" That's the goal of the book and it falls so short of its intention as a cutesy teaching tool because it fails to treat its audience with any kind of respect. "

168,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

However, you know there are many, many books with the same premise. Author's solution: Write a book about how stuff works, but insist on no vocabulary and simple language and attempt for it to be humorousI will preface this review by saying that I was stuck reading this thing on Overdrive and my laptop and this is a book that is meant to be read on paper. But even forgiving the formatting through e-books, this book... missed the mark. Generally I enjoyed the explanations where I understood what was being explained with a wink and a nod, such as the topics about biology. I could infer what the author was saying and it was sort like 'haha... that is rather amusing.' As for the topics where I was unfamiliar... they could be pretty frustrating. This time I was not 'in on' the joke, so sometimes I had no idea what was going on and had to do my best to decipher what he was trying to say. It was more frustrating than anything. There were a few topics where the simplistic explanations really worked. These were generally for less complex machines/ concepts. For example, I enjoyed learning how a padlock works without the fancy terminology. I also liked the oil rig, ship, and constitution examples. Had the author vetted the book in choosing more simple concepts it would have been a better use of my time. In general, while a creative and clearly very thoughtful effort, I'm not sure this concept really worked for me. "

It's great for some laughs and a few reads, but it's nearly impossible to seriously gain knowledge from.I have some ""How Stuff Works"" books that I read when I was around 12 and I understood much more from those than I did in Thing Explainer.Ultimately the judgment of this book depends on what you perceive its goal as: Either it's a joke book made for laughs (not likely given the research required to write it), or it's a legitimate attempt to explain things (more likely given that's literally the title).If Thing Explainer's goal is truly to explain things, it has failed."

It's insightful, funny (""space boats"") and whimsical (the occasional people fencing in the corner of an illustration; rabbits being ""long-ear jumpers""; hedgehogs being ""pointy cats""). There's great range: it covers stuff from pencils to nuclear bombs to classics like the solar system and the history of life. The serious part: I think there's a degree of simplicity to describing things in simple words, a la ""Pale Bale Dot"" or a sky full of stars: it makes all our egos and tribalism and anxieties seem small. It reminds us that life is a pretty simple thing, if you don't make it complicated.Four stars for the occasional use of a frequent word with an infrequent meaning, for ""nine"" not making the ten hundred most popular list, and for the ungooglability of some of the stuff I wanted to learn more about (because, hey, good luck searching by anything than the official scientific name).

The ingenuity which author used to describe the most arcane of things is just amazing.It is fun to read, especially when you have no scientific idea about the thing being described. In fact, knowing the jargon of space and Physics in general actually hampered me, and at times reading in the most layman language I had to think for a minute which scientific object did author really meant.The thing is, you won't read the entire book in one sitting. I don't think you actually can. Even though it is written in the lamest of language, the science stuff is still heavy. Don't get me wrong. That doesn't mean that the book is dense, quite the opposite. It is just that you don't want to go through all that information in one go. So sit with the book and a friend, every once in a while, choose a topic and laugh your ass off as you encounter the author's brilliance and innovation! :D"

However, even in those simple explanations, they use the appropriate terminology and define it. I couldn’t get past the cutesy words used in this. I thought it might be fun to read it with my very curious 3 year old, but I found myself searching for ways to translate it into the more complex language and proper terminology she understands. If a 3 year old can understand language and concepts such as space shuttle (vs. flying space truck) and the names of organs in the human body such as bladder (vs. yellow water holder), I would assume most individuals literate enough to the read the book would as well."

Things can sometimes be explained simply, but often there is a hidden depth and complexity that requires not just specialist language and more explanation, but acknowledgement that some things cannot be simplified without loosing some meaning, depth, or specificity. The aims of this book were noble and in some respects successful, with the humour coming through well. I was however frustrated in other aspects, where meaning was sacrificed for the sake of supposed simplicity, rendering surface level information presented."

I wish he would put the real word for what it is instead of something silly. I feel like I’m learning something but then I don’t know what the real word for the item he is describing is.

So, I was mesmerized by this book for managing to do that. Cannot recommend it enough! It's great! "

For eg. The chapter on the surface of the earth mentioned various interesting facts, but since it doesn't mention any names, looking it up online is difficult.

The idea was cute but the execution was terrible. The overall tone was condescending, treating the reader as if they are the toddler cousin you got stuck with babysitting one night who was genuinely interested in learning about what you do all day, but you lacked the ability unable to stop being an asshole about the situation long enough to try and recognize or engage a willing audience. For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell."" That's the goal of the book and it falls so short of its intention as a cutesy teaching tool because it fails to treat its audience with any kind of respect. "

Light blue, vivid text on white background. Small letters. White text on dark blue background (but written over white stars every now and then). There was no intuitive place to start and stop reading on the page (so I guess I wasnt a fan of the layout?). 2. The writing itself. Instead of gasoline, he said ""fire water"". And you had to play some mental gymnastics to figure out the normal word he was trying to convey. Example: WINDOW CLEANING WATER HOLE: If you run out of cleaning water, you can pour more in here. WINDOW CLEANING WATER: This holds the water that pours onto your windows when you pull on the cleaning control. Way too many words to describe something that is really not that interesting ....

184,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"I'm so torn on my review of this book. On the one hand, Randall Munroe is an incredibly creative, intelligent, and gifted writer. He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all. All in all, I'm proud and happy with my book, and while I will continue to actively endorse What If? as a book for most people, this book becomes more of a side note to a conversation. "

198,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

However, you know there are many, many books with the same premise. Author's solution: Write a book about how stuff works, but insist on no vocabulary and simple language and attempt for it to be humorousI will preface this review by saying that I was stuck reading this thing on Overdrive and my laptop and this is a book that is meant to be read on paper. But even forgiving the formatting through e-books, this book... missed the mark. Generally I enjoyed the explanations where I understood what was being explained with a wink and a nod, such as the topics about biology. I could infer what the author was saying and it was sort like 'haha... that is rather amusing.' As for the topics where I was unfamiliar... they could be pretty frustrating. This time I was not 'in on' the joke, so sometimes I had no idea what was going on and had to do my best to decipher what he was trying to say. It was more frustrating than anything. There were a few topics where the simplistic explanations really worked. These were generally for less complex machines/ concepts. For example, I enjoyed learning how a padlock works without the fancy terminology. I also liked the oil rig, ship, and constitution examples. Had the author vetted the book in choosing more simple concepts it would have been a better use of my time. In general, while a creative and clearly very thoughtful effort, I'm not sure this concept really worked for me. "

It's great for some laughs and a few reads, but it's nearly impossible to seriously gain knowledge from.I have some ""How Stuff Works"" books that I read when I was around 12 and I understood much more from those than I did in Thing Explainer.Ultimately the judgment of this book depends on what you perceive its goal as: Either it's a joke book made for laughs (not likely given the research required to write it), or it's a legitimate attempt to explain things (more likely given that's literally the title).If Thing Explainer's goal is truly to explain things, it has failed."

It's insightful, funny (""space boats"") and whimsical (the occasional people fencing in the corner of an illustration; rabbits being ""long-ear jumpers""; hedgehogs being ""pointy cats""). There's great range: it covers stuff from pencils to nuclear bombs to classics like the solar system and the history of life. The serious part: I think there's a degree of simplicity to describing things in simple words, a la ""Pale Bale Dot"" or a sky full of stars: it makes all our egos and tribalism and anxieties seem small. It reminds us that life is a pretty simple thing, if you don't make it complicated.Four stars for the occasional use of a frequent word with an infrequent meaning, for ""nine"" not making the ten hundred most popular list, and for the ungooglability of some of the stuff I wanted to learn more about (because, hey, good luck searching by anything than the official scientific name). Which is entirely within the author's stated intention, but I'm going to be a fickle reader and exact revenge on him anyway."

The ingenuity which author used to describe the most arcane of things is just amazing.It is fun to read, especially when you have no scientific idea about the thing being described. In fact, knowing the jargon of space and Physics in general actually hampered me, and at times reading in the most layman language I had to think for a minute which scientific object did author really meant.The thing is, you won't read the entire book in one sitting. I don't think you actually can. Even though it is written in the lamest of language, the science stuff is still heavy. Don't get me wrong. That doesn't mean that the book is dense, quite the opposite. It is just that you don't want to go through all that information in one go. So sit with the book and a friend, every once in a while, choose a topic and laugh your ass off as you encounter the author's brilliance and innovation! :D"

However, even in those simple explanations, they use the appropriate terminology and define it. I couldn’t get past the cutesy words used in this. I thought it might be fun to read it with my very curious 3 year old, but I found myself searching for ways to translate it into the more complex language and proper terminology she understands. If a 3 year old can understand language and concepts such as space shuttle (vs. flying space truck) and the names of organs in the human body such as bladder (vs. yellow water holder), I would assume most individuals literate enough to the read the book would as well."
205,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,3,"The world is complicated. Things can sometimes be explained simply, but often there is a hidden depth and complexity that requires not just specialist language and more explanation, but acknowledgement that some things cannot be simplified without loosing some meaning, depth, or specificity. The aims of this book were noble and in some respects successful, with the humour coming through well. I was however frustrated in other aspects, where meaning was sacrificed for the sake of supposed simplicity, rendering surface level information presented."
206,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881944-meg,3,"Very detailed and really informative. I do love the simple language but honestly I figured it would be “more simple”. For instance, often times I find myself trying to figure out a puzzle for what he really means to say. For instance, when listing space flights he calls them “red planet 5” instead of Mars 5. I wish he would put the real word for what it is instead of something silly. I feel like I’m learning something but then I don’t know what the real word for the item he is describing is. So I love the idea but I wish he would have put the real word and then the funny explanation also. "

Trying to explain a concept using only drawings and a vocabulary of just under 1, 000 of the most common words is very interesting. I never thought how many complex or complicated words I use when I am explaining something. Trying to simplify my vocabulary when describing something has always been incredibly hard for me. So, I was mesmerized by this book for managing to do that. Cannot recommend it enough! It's great! "
208,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49023050-sumit-gouthaman,4,"Very interesting concept, did learn a lot of things from the book.But some of the chapters can be infuriating to read. For eg. The chapter on the surface of the earth mentioned various interesting facts, but since it doesn't mention any names, looking it up online is difficult. Similarly, you definitely want a real periodic table to refer when you read the chapter on the periodic table.The chapter that I liked were the ones that described how certain machines worked: washing machine, microwaves, airplane engines, etc."
209,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12080746-laura,1,"So I read this as part of a book club and I was looking forward to it, mostly because I liked xkcd. The idea was cute but the execution was terrible. The overall tone was condescending, treating the reader as if they are the toddler cousin you got stuck with babysitting one night who was genuinely interested in learning about what you do all day, but you lacked the ability unable to stop being an asshole about the situation long enough to try and recognize or engage a willing audience. For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell."" That's the goal of the book and it falls so short of its intention as a cutesy teaching tool because it fails to treat its audience with any kind of respect. "

So, naturally, I wanted to check out this other book.Great concept but I did not like the execution for the following reasons: 1. The text was difficult to read. Light blue, vivid text on white background. Small letters. White text on dark blue background (but written over white stars every now and then). There was no intuitive place to start and stop reading on the page (so I guess I wasnt a fan of the layout?). 2. The writing itself. Instead of gasoline, he said ""fire water"". And you had to play some mental gymnastics to figure out the normal word he was trying to convey. Example: WINDOW CLEANING WATER HOLE: If you run out of cleaning water, you can pour more in here. WINDOW CLEANING WATER: This holds the water that pours onto your windows when you pull on the cleaning control. Way too many words to describe something that is really not that interesting .... This book was not for me. Might be ideal for someone a little younger and quicker mind. "

214,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"I'm so torn on my review of this book. On the one hand, Randall Munroe is an incredibly creative, intelligent, and gifted writer. He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all. All in all, I'm proud and happy with my book, and while I will continue to actively endorse What If? as a book for most people, this book becomes more of a side note to a conversation. "
215,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"I would have loved having this book as a child, since i could never remember the correct names/words for some well known things and found my own ways to name/describe them. This book? This would have been perfect for me. Its not a book in the traditional sense that you read. Its just entertaining to flip through, look through, read a section of it, be entertained by seeing so many well known things explained in much simpler terms. The drawings are great in my option as well, they are ""cute"" enough to be nice for children to look through but ""adult"" enough that older people flipping through the book won't find it childish. This is a great book for everyone that loves learning, enjoys a different version of doing so and likes being entertained!"
216,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,3,"I didn't like this nearly as much as his What if?. That's kind of strange, considering that the content of this book is a lot closer to the format and content of his webcomic than the other is.It's fun, it's quirky - yet I had a lot of trouble reading more than a page or two of it at a time.I do kind of agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the language was perhaps dumbed down a bit too much. There were a few moments where I was absolutely baffled by the name of something even though I knew exactly what was being discussed. I think a good addition might be a page by page glossary at the end of the book to give the more technical names for things. It would have given a bit more clarity if you were confused by his round-about ways of describing things, but it also would make it a lot easier to look up more information about a topic you're interested in.Another thing that slightly annoyed me is that this book is NOT well-served by being available electronically. What If actually crashed my Paperwhite repeatedly - until I gave up and went and got my tablet so I wasn't too surprised that Thing Explainer was limited to just tablets and PC software.Unfortunately, the this is composed solely of image files - no straight text, and those images are sized appropriately for a large format Hardback. My 8"" tablet screen just isn't big enough to display more than half a page at any given time - and much less than that if it is a double-page image. To read this on a tablet, you have to do a LOT of panning and zooming, and frequently have to pause to wait for a higher resolution picture to load. It got old quickly.And, unfortunately, the Kindle software just doesn't work properly on my computer, so I wasn't' able to switch to my much larger monitor to view a whole page at a time.I'd still recommend a paper copy of this book if you're a fan of the webcomic, though. It'd be a fun coffee table book to pick up and glance at every once in awhile. It's just that some books are better in paper."

Some of the simple words were so simple that I really had to look at the thing being explained to figure out what it was, for example, a ""Food Heating Radio Box"" is a microwave oven. Good explanations, and usually entertaining. My favorite was the Tree of Life, where the different types of life on earth are shown in relationship to each other and again, the reader sometimes has to figure out what type of being is named with the simple words (""biter with eight legs"" is a spider). Go read it!"

Munroe explains things as diverse as the composition of pencils and the composition of the interior of a star in incredibly over-simplified language. It's funny and thought-provoking. A note: this is not this decade's The Way Things Work--in fact, if you don't already have a rough idea of how these things work, you will not actually understand any of this. You need at least a working knowledge of freshman year chemistry, physics, astronomy, and more. What it is good for is making you think about the things that you kind of vaguely know about and either have forgotten or never quite got, and making sure you actually turn it around in your brain enough to make things click. (For example, I had to pull up an actual copy of the periodic table to make heads or tails of the periodic table page, but then it was very funny.

228,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

However, you know there are many, many books with the same premise. Author's solution: Write a book about how stuff works, but insist on no vocabulary and simple language and attempt for it to be humorousI will preface this review by saying that I was stuck reading this thing on Overdrive and my laptop and this is a book that is meant to be read on paper. But even forgiving the formatting through e-books, this book... missed the mark. Generally I enjoyed the explanations where I understood what was being explained with a wink and a nod, such as the topics about biology. I could infer what the author was saying and it was sort like 'haha... that is rather amusing.' As for the topics where I was unfamiliar... they could be pretty frustrating. This time I was not 'in on' the joke, so sometimes I had no idea what was going on and had to do my best to decipher what he was trying to say. It was more frustrating than anything. There were a few topics where the simplistic explanations really worked. These were generally for less complex machines/ concepts. For example, I enjoyed learning how a padlock works without the fancy terminology. I also liked the oil rig, ship, and constitution examples. Had the author vetted the book in choosing more simple concepts it would have been a better use of my time. In general, while a creative and clearly very thoughtful effort, I'm not sure this concept really worked for me. "

It's great for some laughs and a few reads, but it's nearly impossible to seriously gain knowledge from.I have some ""How Stuff Works"" books that I read when I was around 12 and I understood much more from those than I did in Thing Explainer.Ultimately the judgment of this book depends on what you perceive its goal as: Either it's a joke book made for laughs (not likely given the research required to write it), or it's a legitimate attempt to explain things (more likely given that's literally the title).If Thing Explainer's goal is truly to explain things, it has failed."
232,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001885-r-zvan-ionescu,4,"Expanding on https://xkcd.com/1133/ , this is an entire book of things explained using the most common thousand (""one hundred"") words, plus a poster. It's insightful, funny (""space boats"") and whimsical (the occasional people fencing in the corner of an illustration; rabbits being ""long-ear jumpers""; hedgehogs being ""pointy cats""). There's great range: it covers stuff from pencils to nuclear bombs to classics like the solar system and the history of life. The serious part: I think there's a degree of simplicity to describing things in simple words, a la ""Pale Bale Dot"" or a sky full of stars: it makes all our egos and tribalism and anxieties seem small. It reminds us that life is a pretty simple thing, if you don't make it complicated.Four stars for the occasional use of a frequent word with an infrequent meaning, for ""nine"" not making the ten hundred most popular list, and for the ungooglability of some of the stuff I wanted to learn more about (because, hey, good luck searching by anything than the official scientific name). Which is entirely within the author's stated intention, but I'm going to be a fickle reader and exact revenge on him anyway."
233,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9858514-ramiz-qudsi,5,"Hilarious is the word that describes the book. Every bit as funny as his comic strips and the book totally lives up to its title. The ingenuity which author used to describe the most arcane of things is just amazing.It is fun to read, especially when you have no scientific idea about the thing being described. In fact, knowing the jargon of space and Physics in general actually hampered me, and at times reading in the most layman language I had to think for a minute which scientific object did author really meant.The thing is, you won't read the entire book in one sitting. I don't think you actually can. Even though it is written in the lamest of language, the science stuff is still heavy. Don't get me wrong. That doesn't mean that the book is dense, quite the opposite. It is just that you don't want to go through all that information in one go. So sit with the book and a friend, every once in a while, choose a topic and laugh your ass off as you encounter the author's brilliance and innovation! :D"
234,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1666079-jessica,1,"I was excited to find this book since I love looking at diagrams and like to read “explain like I’m five” descriptions of how things work. However, even in those simple explanations, they use the appropriate terminology and define it. I couldn’t get past the cutesy words used in this. I thought it might be fun to read it with my very curious 3 year old, but I found myself searching for ways to translate it into the more complex language and proper terminology she understands. If a 3 year old can understand language and concepts such as space shuttle (vs. flying space truck) and the names of organs in the human body such as bladder (vs. yellow water holder), I would assume most individuals literate enough to the read the book would as well."
235,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,3,"The world is complicated. Things can sometimes be explained simply, but often there is a hidden depth and complexity that requires not just specialist language and more explanation, but acknowledgement that some things cannot be simplified without loosing some meaning, depth, or specificity. The aims of this book were noble and in some respects successful, with the humour coming through well. I was however frustrated in other aspects, where meaning was sacrificed for the sake of supposed simplicity, rendering surface level information presented."
236,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881944-meg,3,"Very detailed and really informative. I do love the simple language but honestly I figured it would be “more simple”. For instance, often times I find myself trying to figure out a puzzle for what he really means to say. For instance, when listing space flights he calls them “red planet 5” instead of Mars 5. I wish he would put the real word for what it is instead of something silly. I feel like I’m learning something but then I don’t know what the real word for the item he is describing is. So I love the idea but I wish he would have put the real word and then the funny explanation also. "
237,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37124155-lthmath,4,"An awesome non-fiction about science, engineering, history and more full of incredible illustrations. The idea intrigued me. Trying to explain a concept using only drawings and a vocabulary of just under 1, 000 of the most common words is very interesting. I never thought how many complex or complicated words I use when I am explaining something. Trying to simplify my vocabulary when describing something has always been incredibly hard for me. So, I was mesmerized by this book for managing to do that. Cannot recommend it enough! It's great! "
238,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49023050-sumit-gouthaman,4,"Very interesting concept, did learn a lot of things from the book.But some of the chapters can be infuriating to read. For eg. The chapter on the surface of the earth mentioned various interesting facts, but since it doesn't mention any names, looking it up online is difficult. Similarly, you definitely want a real periodic table to refer when you read the chapter on the periodic table.The chapter that I liked were the ones that described how certain machines worked: washing machine, microwaves, airplane engines, etc."
239,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12080746-laura,1,"So I read this as part of a book club and I was looking forward to it, mostly because I liked xkcd. The idea was cute but the execution was terrible. The overall tone was condescending, treating the reader as if they are the toddler cousin you got stuck with babysitting one night who was genuinely interested in learning about what you do all day, but you lacked the ability unable to stop being an asshole about the situation long enough to try and recognize or engage a willing audience. For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell."" That's the goal of the book and it falls so short of its intention as a cutesy teaching tool because it fails to treat its audience with any kind of respect. "

So, naturally, I wanted to check out this other book.Great concept but I did not like the execution for the following reasons: 1. The text was difficult to read. Light blue, vivid text on white background. Small letters. White text on dark blue background (but written over white stars every now and then). There was no intuitive place to start and stop reading on the page (so I guess I wasnt a fan of the layout?). 2. The writing itself. Instead of gasoline, he said ""fire water"". And you had to play some mental gymnastics to figure out the normal word he was trying to convey. Example: WINDOW CLEANING WATER HOLE: If you run out of cleaning water, you can pour more in here. WINDOW CLEANING WATER: This holds the water that pours onto your windows when you pull on the cleaning control. Way too many words to describe something that is really not that interesting .... This book was not for me. Might be ideal for someone a little younger and quicker mind. "

244,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"I'm so torn on my review of this book. On the one hand, Randall Munroe is an incredibly creative, intelligent, and gifted writer. He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all. All in all, I'm proud and happy with my book, and while I will continue to actively endorse What If? as a book for most people, this book becomes more of a side note to a conversation. "
245,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"I would have loved having this book as a child, since i could never remember the correct names/words for some well known things and found my own ways to name/describe them. This book? This would have been perfect for me. Its not a book in the traditional sense that you read. Its just entertaining to flip through, look through, read a section of it, be entertained by seeing so many well known things explained in much simpler terms. The drawings are great in my option as well, they are ""cute"" enough to be nice for children to look through but ""adult"" enough that older people flipping through the book won't find it childish. This is a great book for everyone that loves learning, enjoys a different version of doing so and likes being entertained!"
246,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,3,"I didn't like this nearly as much as his What if?. That's kind of strange, considering that the content of this book is a lot closer to the format and content of his webcomic than the other is.It's fun, it's quirky - yet I had a lot of trouble reading more than a page or two of it at a time.I do kind of agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the language was perhaps dumbed down a bit too much. There were a few moments where I was absolutely baffled by the name of something even though I knew exactly what was being discussed. I think a good addition might be a page by page glossary at the end of the book to give the more technical names for things. It would have given a bit more clarity if you were confused by his round-about ways of describing things, but it also would make it a lot easier to look up more information about a topic you're interested in.Another thing that slightly annoyed me is that this book is NOT well-served by being available electronically. What If actually crashed my Paperwhite repeatedly - until I gave up and went and got my tablet so I wasn't too surprised that Thing Explainer was limited to just tablets and PC software.Unfortunately, the this is composed solely of image files - no straight text, and those images are sized appropriately for a large format Hardback. My 8"" tablet screen just isn't big enough to display more than half a page at any given time - and much less than that if it is a double-page image. To read this on a tablet, you have to do a LOT of panning and zooming, and frequently have to pause to wait for a higher resolution picture to load. It got old quickly.And, unfortunately, the Kindle software just doesn't work properly on my computer, so I wasn't' able to switch to my much larger monitor to view a whole page at a time.I'd still recommend a paper copy of this book if you're a fan of the webcomic, though. It'd be a fun coffee table book to pick up and glance at every once in awhile. It's just that some books are better in paper."
247,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975036-kris,5,"The title pretty much says it all. Some of the simple words were so simple that I really had to look at the thing being explained to figure out what it was, for example, a ""Food Heating Radio Box"" is a microwave oven. Good explanations, and usually entertaining. My favorite was the Tree of Life, where the different types of life on earth are shown in relationship to each other and again, the reader sometimes has to figure out what type of being is named with the simple words (""biter with eight legs"" is a spider). Go read it!"
248,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"Several years ago, xkcd featured a comic about ""Upgoer Five"", a diagram of the Saturn rocket explained entirely in the top thousand most used words. (This is most well-known for the concluding sentence ""If it starts pointing at space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today."") This is an entire book of that. Munroe explains things as diverse as the composition of pencils and the composition of the interior of a star in incredibly over-simplified language. It's funny and thought-provoking. A note: this is not this decade's The Way Things Work--in fact, if you don't already have a rough idea of how these things work, you will not actually understand any of this. You need at least a working knowledge of freshman year chemistry, physics, astronomy, and more. What it is good for is making you think about the things that you kind of vaguely know about and either have forgotten or never quite got, and making sure you actually turn it around in your brain enough to make things click. (For example, I had to pull up an actual copy of the periodic table to make heads or tails of the periodic table page, but then it was very funny. And I learned about some properties and history I hadn't known before.) It's a puzzle, in which you try to figure out what the real words that he's not using should be, how that all plays into his explanations, and then translate it out again to get the joke. It's delightful for nerds. I would not bother having my son read it until at least halfway through high school."

Plain language is a good thing - and yes, Munroe's work here is laudable! - but call a 'cell' a cell - not ""tiny bags of water you're made of""...and then it just keeps going from there. For some processes like weather, plate tectonics, and even how a washing machine works, it was pretty interesting, but when describing a nuclear reactor, there are just some words you need to say. His dedication to plain language (extremely plain language) makes every page very wordy. To avoid saying one word, he has to use a whole phrase to describe - and it's just a jumble. And while the illustrations are well done and fun to study, all of the wordy descriptions and arrows bring flashbacks of A Beautiful Mind.Still, worth picking up and flipping through - it's very entertaining, and I learned several things from it.

The language limitation forced him to come up with roundabout and, in many ways, easier to understand explanations for common things.

I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd). I guess I'll keep crossing my fingers for a ""What If?"" sequel."

There's great range: it covers stuff from pencils to nuclear bombs to classics like the solar system and the history of life. The serious part: I think there's a degree of simplicity to describing things in simple words, a la ""Pale Bale Dot"" or a sky full of stars: it makes all our egos and tribalism and anxieties seem small. It reminds us that life is a pretty simple thing, if you don't make it complicated.Four stars for the occasional use of a frequent word with an infrequent meaning, for ""nine"" not making the ten hundred most popular list, and for the ungooglability of some of the stuff I wanted to learn more about (because, hey, good luck searching by anything than the official scientific name).

In fact, knowing the jargon of space and Physics in general actually hampered me, and at times reading in the most layman language I had to think for a minute which scientific object did author really meant.The thing is, you won't read the entire book in one sitting. I don't think you actually can. Even though it is written in the lamest of language, the science stuff is still heavy. Don't get me wrong. That doesn't mean that the book is dense, quite the opposite. It is just that you don't want to go through all that information in one go.

However, even in those simple explanations, they use the appropriate terminology and define it. I couldn’t get past the cutesy words used in this. I thought it might be fun to read it with my very curious 3 year old, but I found myself searching for ways to translate it into the more complex language and proper terminology she understands. If a 3 year old can understand language and concepts such as space shuttle (vs. flying space truck) and the names of organs in the human body such as bladder (vs. yellow water holder), I would assume most individuals literate enough to the read the book would as well."

Things can sometimes be explained simply, but often there is a hidden depth and complexity that requires not just specialist language and more explanation, but acknowledgement that some things cannot be simplified without loosing some meaning, depth, or specificity. The aims of this book were noble and in some respects successful, with the humour coming through well. I was however frustrated in other aspects, where meaning was sacrificed for the sake of supposed simplicity, rendering surface level information presented."

For instance, often times I find myself trying to figure out a puzzle for what he really means to say. For instance, when listing space flights he calls them “red planet 5” instead of Mars 5. I wish he would put the real word for what it is instead of something silly. I feel like I’m learning something but then I don’t know what the real word for the item he is describing is.

For eg. The chapter on the surface of the earth mentioned various interesting facts, but since it doesn't mention any names, looking it up online is difficult.

The idea was cute but the execution was terrible. The overall tone was condescending, treating the reader as if they are the toddler cousin you got stuck with babysitting one night who was genuinely interested in learning about what you do all day, but you lacked the ability unable to stop being an asshole about the situation long enough to try and recognize or engage a willing audience. For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell."" That's the goal of the book and it falls so short of its intention as a cutesy teaching tool because it fails to treat its audience with any kind of respect. "

Light blue, vivid text on white background. Small letters. White text on dark blue background (but written over white stars every now and then). There was no intuitive place to start and stop reading on the page (so I guess I wasnt a fan of the layout?). 2. The writing itself. Instead of gasoline, he said ""fire water"". And you had to play some mental gymnastics to figure out the normal word he was trying to convey. Example: WINDOW CLEANING WATER HOLE: If you run out of cleaning water, you can pour more in here. WINDOW CLEANING WATER: This holds the water that pours onto your windows when you pull on the cleaning control. Way too many words to describe something that is really not that interesting ....

274,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"I'm so torn on my review of this book. On the one hand, Randall Munroe is an incredibly creative, intelligent, and gifted writer. He connects with a niche sort of person, and I just happen to be that sort of person. I've recommended his What If? blog to more people than I can count, and I was very excited to get my hands on his next publication. Being familiar with the comic it's based on, I knew that this would be a complicated, not-necessarily-enlightening affair.As a worst-case scenario, I feel good about my purchase because it involved throwing monetary support towards someone whose writing style I support. The book was exactly what you would expect (a book that only uses the ""ten hundred"" most common words to describe very complicated things), and I (and many others) found that the use of common words only made most of the subjects more confusing. To its detriment, the uses of humor were found only in several instances per page, but those pages are dense. The book is 60 pages long but it takes hours to read. So, if you find one or two laughs or great insights per page, you're working hard for those. Additionally, it makes progress feel like it's slow-going. I found myself skimming some pages (like the astrology chart or the periodic table) because I would have had to do research to actually understand what he was talking about. To Randall's credit, however, the fact that he's even able to sneak as much humor into this book as he does is a tribute to his creativity and connection with his core audience: he knows what we will find humorous, and he delivers as often as he can.What this book really did do for me is make me want to look up these ideas for myself. How do nuclear reactors work? (maybe I should think twice before googling that) How do cars work? How do refrigerators work? I don't know much more about these things now, even though they were explained in the book, but now I'm more curious about them than I was before. Was that Randall's intent all along? Maybe not directly, but I'm sure he wouldn't be disappointed if that were the end result. Like I said, this book was exactly what I expected- complicated things explained in a very round-about manner that's not necessarily straightforward at all. All in all, I'm proud and happy with my book, and while I will continue to actively endorse What If? as a book for most people, this book becomes more of a side note to a conversation. "
275,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"I would have loved having this book as a child, since i could never remember the correct names/words for some well known things and found my own ways to name/describe them. This book? This would have been perfect for me. Its not a book in the traditional sense that you read. Its just entertaining to flip through, look through, read a section of it, be entertained by seeing so many well known things explained in much simpler terms. The drawings are great in my option as well, they are ""cute"" enough to be nice for children to look through but ""adult"" enough that older people flipping through the book won't find it childish. This is a great book for everyone that loves learning, enjoys a different version of doing so and likes being entertained!"
276,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,3,"I didn't like this nearly as much as his What if?. That's kind of strange, considering that the content of this book is a lot closer to the format and content of his webcomic than the other is.It's fun, it's quirky - yet I had a lot of trouble reading more than a page or two of it at a time.I do kind of agree with a couple of the other reviewers that the language was perhaps dumbed down a bit too much. There were a few moments where I was absolutely baffled by the name of something even though I knew exactly what was being discussed. I think a good addition might be a page by page glossary at the end of the book to give the more technical names for things. It would have given a bit more clarity if you were confused by his round-about ways of describing things, but it also would make it a lot easier to look up more information about a topic you're interested in.Another thing that slightly annoyed me is that this book is NOT well-served by being available electronically. What If actually crashed my Paperwhite repeatedly - until I gave up and went and got my tablet so I wasn't too surprised that Thing Explainer was limited to just tablets and PC software.Unfortunately, the this is composed solely of image files - no straight text, and those images are sized appropriately for a large format Hardback. My 8"" tablet screen just isn't big enough to display more than half a page at any given time - and much less than that if it is a double-page image. To read this on a tablet, you have to do a LOT of panning and zooming, and frequently have to pause to wait for a higher resolution picture to load. It got old quickly.And, unfortunately, the Kindle software just doesn't work properly on my computer, so I wasn't' able to switch to my much larger monitor to view a whole page at a time.I'd still recommend a paper copy of this book if you're a fan of the webcomic, though. It'd be a fun coffee table book to pick up and glance at every once in awhile. It's just that some books are better in paper."
277,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975036-kris,5,"The title pretty much says it all. Some of the simple words were so simple that I really had to look at the thing being explained to figure out what it was, for example, a ""Food Heating Radio Box"" is a microwave oven. Good explanations, and usually entertaining. My favorite was the Tree of Life, where the different types of life on earth are shown in relationship to each other and again, the reader sometimes has to figure out what type of being is named with the simple words (""biter with eight legs"" is a spider). Go read it!"
278,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"Several years ago, xkcd featured a comic about ""Upgoer Five"", a diagram of the Saturn rocket explained entirely in the top thousand most used words. (This is most well-known for the concluding sentence ""If it starts pointing at space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today."") This is an entire book of that. Munroe explains things as diverse as the composition of pencils and the composition of the interior of a star in incredibly over-simplified language. It's funny and thought-provoking. A note: this is not this decade's The Way Things Work--in fact, if you don't already have a rough idea of how these things work, you will not actually understand any of this. You need at least a working knowledge of freshman year chemistry, physics, astronomy, and more. What it is good for is making you think about the things that you kind of vaguely know about and either have forgotten or never quite got, and making sure you actually turn it around in your brain enough to make things click. (For example, I had to pull up an actual copy of the periodic table to make heads or tails of the periodic table page, but then it was very funny. And I learned about some properties and history I hadn't known before.) It's a puzzle, in which you try to figure out what the real words that he's not using should be, how that all plays into his explanations, and then translate it out again to get the joke. It's delightful for nerds. I would not bother having my son read it until at least halfway through high school."

Plain language is a good thing - and yes, Munroe's work here is laudable! - but call a 'cell' a cell - not ""tiny bags of water you're made of""...and then it just keeps going from there. For some processes like weather, plate tectonics, and even how a washing machine works, it was pretty interesting, but when describing a nuclear reactor, there are just some words you need to say. His dedication to plain language (extremely plain language) makes every page very wordy. To avoid saying one word, he has to use a whole phrase to describe - and it's just a jumble. And while the illustrations are well done and fun to study, all of the wordy descriptions and arrows bring flashbacks of A Beautiful Mind.Still, worth picking up and flipping through - it's very entertaining, and I learned several things from it.

288,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,3,"Let me first say that I really enjoy Randall Munroe's xkcd comics and especially enjoyed What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions even though I'm really not all that ""sciency"" of a person. His mix of thorough investigation and attention to details, as well as dry humor and trademark stick people make for a great combination.I am also impressed at the massive undertaking this book must have been. The idea is that Munroe chose the one thousand most common words in the English language (or as he has to refer to them here, ""ten hundred""), and then had to use only those words to explain various concepts from physical sciences, technology, architecture, etc. using diagrams and descriptions.When I first got this book from the library, I figured I'd just sit down and read it like a regular book -- left to right, beginning to end, to make sure I didn't miss anything. But that just wasn't working for me... it got to be ""too much."" Overall I think it's best to just page through it and read what strikes your fancy. So I'm sure I haven't read every single word in it, but I'm okay with that.After reading a little, I found myself wondering, ""What kind of audience is this book intended for, anyway?""If I've learned anything from this book, it is that vocabulary is very important, if not essential, to learning new information. New vocabulary functions as the ""peg"" on which new information hangs -- without that, it can be very difficult to really think about, speak about, and process (and therefore, retain) any of that new information.It seems to me that most of the diagrams/explanations in this book are useful in one of two cases:A: You aren't really all that interested in learning about the subject, and so appreciate a very brief and easy-to-understand overview of a topic you haven't built up the vocabulary for anyway; orB: You are already quite familiar with the subject, and so can ""fill in"" the missing (or rather, re-written) vocabulary words and find some humor and insight in seeing something you already know explained in a new way.So as an example of A: nuclear reactors. I know nothing about them (except that they're dangerous) and don't really have much desire to, so to read a brief description of how one works, in language that doesn't introduce complicated new words to me, is fine, and even potentially informative. An example for B would be his page on the major organs of the human body, laid out in a not-to-scale, flow-chart-ish diagram, which is actually quite interesting, and since I have a decent grasp of the basics of anatomy and physiology, I chuckled at many of his new names for things, such as ""blood pusher"" for heart (even though ""heart"" is actually on his list of 1,000 words), or the ""parts for making more of you"" label applied to internal reproductive organs. Oh, and ""yellow water holder"" for the bladder. But in general, I find that for most of these subjects, I'm really somewhere between A and B. They are subjects I wouldn't mind learning more about (earth's surface, plate tectonics, astronomy, etc.), but I'm not proficient enough at yet to get the inside jokes, which can be frustrating.For example, in ""Tiny bags of water you're made of"" (cells), I could recognize some things like the nucleus and membrane, but the piece labeled ""bags of death water"" has me confused -- it's been a while since I took biology and I just can't pull up the name of whatever that is, even with the description he gives. And good luck googling anything here if it confuses you and you want to learn more -- it's hard to find anything specific when you lack the proper term for it, without having to read a whole detailed description of the larger topic, which I could have just done in the first place. So that's why it seems to me that this is really only useful for actual learning if you don't care enough about the subject to learn some basic vocabulary (in which case the ""learning"" will most likely be fairly limited). But I did find some amusement on the ""Pieces everything is made of"" page (the periodic table of the elements), trying to guess elements by their descriptions. I figured out ""the stuff teeth are made of"" and ""air in bright signs made from colored light,"" as well as a couple others. And the great thing about this page is that since all the elements are arranged the same way, it's easy to look up an actual periodic table to see whether I actually got them correct -- so that was fun, and would probably be even more fun for someone who uses the periodic table on a regular basis.So I'm glad I got this from the library because I did find some interest and amusement in it, but I don't think I'd want to buy it (even my more-sciency husband wasn't intrigued enough by the concept to ask for it for Christmas even though he's the one that introduced me to xkcd).

It's insightful, funny (""space boats"") and whimsical (the occasional people fencing in the corner of an illustration; rabbits being ""long-ear jumpers""; hedgehogs being ""pointy cats""). There's great range: it covers stuff from pencils to nuclear bombs to classics like the solar system and the history of life. The serious part: I think there's a degree of simplicity to describing things in simple words, a la ""Pale Bale Dot"" or a sky full of stars: it makes all our egos and tribalism and anxieties seem small. It reminds us that life is a pretty simple thing, if you don't make it complicated.Four stars for the occasional use of a frequent word with an infrequent meaning, for ""nine"" not making the ten hundred most popular list, and for the ungooglability of some of the stuff I wanted to learn more about (because, hey, good luck searching by anything than the official scientific name). Which is entirely within the author's stated intention, but I'm going to be a fickle reader and exact revenge on him anyway."
293,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9858514-ramiz-qudsi,5,"Hilarious is the word that describes the book. Every bit as funny as his comic strips and the book totally lives up to its title. The ingenuity which author used to describe the most arcane of things is just amazing.It is fun to read, especially when you have no scientific idea about the thing being described. In fact, knowing the jargon of space and Physics in general actually hampered me, and at times reading in the most layman language I had to think for a minute which scientific object did author really meant.The thing is, you won't read the entire book in one sitting. I don't think you actually can. Even though it is written in the lamest of language, the science stuff is still heavy. Don't get me wrong. That doesn't mean that the book is dense, quite the opposite. It is just that you don't want to go through all that information in one go. So sit with the book and a friend, every once in a while, choose a topic and laugh your ass off as you encounter the author's brilliance and innovation! :D"
294,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1666079-jessica,1,"I was excited to find this book since I love looking at diagrams and like to read “explain like I’m five” descriptions of how things work. However, even in those simple explanations, they use the appropriate terminology and define it. I couldn’t get past the cutesy words used in this. I thought it might be fun to read it with my very curious 3 year old, but I found myself searching for ways to translate it into the more complex language and proper terminology she understands. If a 3 year old can understand language and concepts such as space shuttle (vs. flying space truck) and the names of organs in the human body such as bladder (vs. yellow water holder), I would assume most individuals literate enough to the read the book would as well."
295,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,3,"The world is complicated. Things can sometimes be explained simply, but often there is a hidden depth and complexity that requires not just specialist language and more explanation, but acknowledgement that some things cannot be simplified without loosing some meaning, depth, or specificity. The aims of this book were noble and in some respects successful, with the humour coming through well. I was however frustrated in other aspects, where meaning was sacrificed for the sake of supposed simplicity, rendering surface level information presented."
296,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881944-meg,3,"Very detailed and really informative. I do love the simple language but honestly I figured it would be “more simple”. For instance, often times I find myself trying to figure out a puzzle for what he really means to say. For instance, when listing space flights he calls them “red planet 5” instead of Mars 5. I wish he would put the real word for what it is instead of something silly. I feel like I’m learning something but then I don’t know what the real word for the item he is describing is. So I love the idea but I wish he would have put the real word and then the funny explanation also. "
297,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37124155-lthmath,4,"An awesome non-fiction about science, engineering, history and more full of incredible illustrations. The idea intrigued me. Trying to explain a concept using only drawings and a vocabulary of just under 1, 000 of the most common words is very interesting. I never thought how many complex or complicated words I use when I am explaining something. Trying to simplify my vocabulary when describing something has always been incredibly hard for me. So, I was mesmerized by this book for managing to do that. Cannot recommend it enough! It's great! "
298,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49023050-sumit-gouthaman,4,"Very interesting concept, did learn a lot of things from the book.But some of the chapters can be infuriating to read. For eg. The chapter on the surface of the earth mentioned various interesting facts, but since it doesn't mention any names, looking it up online is difficult. Similarly, you definitely want a real periodic table to refer when you read the chapter on the periodic table.The chapter that I liked were the ones that described how certain machines worked: washing machine, microwaves, airplane engines, etc."
299,0544668251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12080746-laura,1,"So I read this as part of a book club and I was looking forward to it, mostly because I liked xkcd. The idea was cute but the execution was terrible. The overall tone was condescending, treating the reader as if they are the toddler cousin you got stuck with babysitting one night who was genuinely interested in learning about what you do all day, but you lacked the ability unable to stop being an asshole about the situation long enough to try and recognize or engage a willing audience. For example, if you are going to explain what mitochondria are, it helpful to use the term at least once. ""This is mitochondria. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does in the cell."" That's the goal of the book and it falls so short of its intention as a cutesy teaching tool because it fails to treat its audience with any kind of respect. "
