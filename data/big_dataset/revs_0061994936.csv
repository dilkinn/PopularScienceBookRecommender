Ultimately, the book fails to advance any meaningful analysis. Blum's self-imposed task was to find physical infrastructure components of the global internet, but instead he drowns us in aspirational language more concerned with the wonder of modern inter-connectivity than the task at hand. Fancy literary references make it seem Blum is more familiar with liberal arts curriculum than anything technical. For those readers with a basic understanding of the internet, this book will not enhance their understanding at all. Those lacking a basic understanding may find themselves lost. Blum visited many interesting sites and met with some knowledgeable network engineers. Unfortunately, his jaunts come across as vacations lacking much benefit to the reader.This disappointing book is written in an unwarranted self-indulgent style. Readers interested in the topic of communications systems may be interested in Tim Wu's well-documented historical analysis, ""The Master Switch."""
1,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6311994-ken,2,"Overall, this was a disappointing book. The author had a technical subject matter -- the book could have read like a technical manual, though it didn't -- but in trying to make it accessible, I think he basically ended up skipping the subject matter. The book is supposed to be about the internet. Really though, it's more about the author's quest to see the internet. As such, he spent (in my opinion) too much time talking about how people he met were dressed and what they were doing and not enough time talking about the internet and how they functioned. I read this entire book, but don't feel that I am any more enlightened about the internet or how it functions."
2,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5593045-loring-wirbel,3," If I was to rate this on the quality of writing alone, Blum could win a high 4, maybe a 5, for the richness of his descriptive passages, particularly in the parts on the cable landing stations in Cornwall or the modernization of The Dalles in Oregon. Let's face it, Blum can write well and engagingly. Nevertheless, even in the writing style there are a few nagging problems. His tendency to use quotes from literary sources like Emerson or J.G. Ballard is OK when limited to once or twice in a single book, but after a while the use of such quotes sounds a little too grad-student for my tastes. There were passages that were just trite or silly, as well - the squirrel chewing up cable, complete with exclamation points in the text; the description of Silicon Valley as startup mecca, when that description even seemed dated and pedestrian in the 1980s; and the reference to The Dalles as a digital Kathmandu. Don't get me wrong, I like the Zen aspects of Blum's search, it's just that one must be careful in using these analogies at getting too starry-eyed. Also, he gets a trifle over-dramatic in confronting the secrecy of Google and other companies in dealing with data center locations. If Blum was like James Bamford, chasing down the location of snooping centers of intelligence agencies, he'd have reason to feel paranoid. Here, his fears just seem silly.But there is another aspect of Blum's work that makes me rank the book in the high-3's, albeit moving closer to 4. I disagree with the nature of his quest and the way he chooses to pursue it. I know, I know, that sounds like a reviewer for a travel book who says he wished the writer had gone to Spain instead of Kazakhstan. But bear with me.Blum rightly sees a certain spiritual quest in examining the communication protocol layers of the Internet, and there's an argument to be made for treating the Open Systems Interconnect seven-layer stack as a mysterious bardo. But Blum sees the bottom two layers, physical and data-link, as representing physical macro-geography. And that's where network engineers raise their eyebrows at his quest. Does it matter whether the data center is in The Dalles or Prineville? Does it matter whether a Cisco or Brocade router sits at the center? Does it matter the locations on the planet where networks aggregate? Some might talk about planetary magnetic fields and ley lines and say, ""Oh yes it does."" Maybe so, but by spending too much time on large-scale geography, you miss the spiritual layers underneath.To really make some good analogies of the type Blum strives for, you need to understand the underlying chip architectures and middle-ware software responsible for dissecting packets and putting them back together. You need to understand the Zen of Ethernet switching, multi-protocol label switching, and dense wave-division multiplexing. Then you need to be able to translate that in a way your grandmother can understand. Does that mean one needs a BSEE or geekdom certification? No, but it means one needs to go deeper into the technology than Blum did.A similar problem exists when he equates the physical backbone of the Internet with fiber optics. This is true today, but the optics might some day be replaced by millimeter-wave radio or some sort of quantum-computing ""weird action at a distance."" The key to the Internet's center is bandwidth itself, and optical switching is merely the best current manifestation.The reason this matters is that several books that made a technology deep-dive on the history and nature of the Internet were released 10 to 15 years ago, such as Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon's ""Where Wizards Stay Up Late"" (1996). A lot has happened to the Internet since then, but Blum had to show he could tackle the more recent nuances and still come out with something that moved beyond the Hafner/Lyon book.I still think this book is worth a read for learning some details of specific place - the paranoid secrecy of Google officials in discussing their data centers, for example, teaches us that Google is a lot creepier than Facebook in its own way. Blum's talents could be put to future use - he would be a great candidate to join with James Bamford in dissecting the new NSA data center in Bluffdale, Utah, for example. But I can't help but feel this book would have been a lot more interesting if Blum had used his Zen quest to dive deeper into the underlying chips and software that make the Internet hum."

Unfortunately, it isn't more interesting than that. There are wires, buildings and cables. Some are messy.

7,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10505847-mary-soderstrom,4," What the Internet Is: Fragile or Robust?As I write this, The New York Times has been off-line for about 18 hours here. Some stories are being posted on the newspaper's Facebook page, but because of a hacker attack the main website remains down. This is a warning shot, according to some observers. Syrian hackers or hackers sympathic to the Syrian regime (and who call themselves the Syrian Electronic Army) are demonstrating what havoc they could wreak if Western powers follow through on their tough talk. The trouble follows the disruption of the Nasdaq stock exchange a week ago, which is supposed to be due to a technical glitch rather than bad guys.Both events are troubling, and underscore how much we rely on binary code sent at the speed of light to operate nearly every corner of our lives.According to Informationnews, the current hacker battle involves trying to wrest control ""by adjusting the domain name system (DNS) settings for the hacked sites....""The affected domain names were all registered through Australia-based Melbourne IT, which confirmed Wednesday that its systems had been compromised by hackers. The company said Wednesday that it had restored the hacked DNS credentials, locked those records to prevent further changes, disabled the legitimate account credentials that hackers had used to access its systems, and continued to investigate the intrusion."" Melbourne? Aren't we talking about New York? Those are questions I might have asked, had I not just finished reading Andrew Blum's recent Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet.  A journalist who has written often for Wired, Blum began his quest when a squirrel gnawed through a fiber optic cable connecting his computers to the internet. A little disingenuosly, he says he wanted to know to what that cable connected him. The result is an engaging, somewhat meandering story of his travels to find out.To make a long story short, the cable was (and is) connected to other cables which pass through several junctions where information is routed practically instaneously, and automatically directed to its destination. Blum is very good at giving the (relatively short) history of how these networks were set up and what they look like. He's also good at finding a good comparison: cases containing coils of optic fiber cable are the size of Labradors and the cable itself looks like ""giant squid."" The reader learns why you don't often get that annoying lag in transcontinental telephone conversations these days (the signals used to be bounced up to sattelites, but most now go by undersea cable: same speed, shorter distance). Blum tells us about the secrecy at Google's data center storage facilities on the Columbia River in Oregon, and the much more open facility at Facebook's installations a couple of hundred miles away. The difference, he suggests, may have much to do with the way ""Facebook played fast and loose with our privacy while Google vehementaly protected it.""He also tells us that those little packets of information that are our emails, web pages, pictures and stock quotations must be ""goosed"" along every 50 miles or so to keep moving at light speed. But what he doesn't do is give a really good explanation of how those packets are made up. Yes, we know that binary code is just circuits off and on, but how does that get transformed into light? Are we talking simple alternating current here? Or something else? The book has no maps or charts that might let us figure out why messing around with DNS in Melbourne could shut down website of giants in New York. And Blum is rather sanguine about where this all leading us. The internet isn't ""a physical world or a virtual world, but a human world,"" he ends the book. ""...Wherever I am, wherever you are.""So even though I felt myself better informed when I finished the book, this morning I am considerably more concerned about where all this interconnectivity is leading us. It makes perfect sense that Melbourne IT ordinarily involved in spreading the NYT's word around the world, and trouble there could mean trouble lots of other places. BTW, are you receiving this?"
8,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848234-christoph,3,"The internet is a thing, not an idea, not the virtual, not psychology, not a medium. All these tropes have been exhausted in all the other similar inventions preceding it such as radio, phones, TV, or satellites. As a matter of fact some of those infrastructures that comprise the other objects at one time or another were justified by acting as a means to transmit the internet. But Andrew Blum in Tubes diagrams and explains all the ways in which the internet becomes a thing. This book is basically a technical history of the internet and its actually not bad. Blum uses metaphor (lots of it), humor, prose, pop culture, and emotion to consider this thing we call the internet. Blum begins at the starting point for any individual on the internet, at the terminal, and traces the lines through the various stages of internet architecture including transmission infrastructure, topographic structure, and logic to create as human a story of the internet as one can get.Although I do have high praise for the story there are some interesting missteps. The biggest gripe I have is the constant need to contextualize the internet into ideas that people can consume. The explanation of the volume of data passing through an exchange or the speed of data transmission across continents on undersea data lines can never just pass on its on merits, it must be compared to some other more relatable concept. I understand the need for comparison, but over and over and it sort of creates a cognitive dissonance that this thing which actually exists that is not conceptual must constantly be explained in terms of things that it absolutely isnt. Also, the last chapter of this book to me is very problematic. The last chapter goes into quite some detail on data centers specifically two storage centers, both in Oregon, one controlled by Google and the other by Facebook. Here a bit of ideology seems to seep into what was previously an unbiased assessment of an industry that was basically built on ideology. Blum seems to basically slam Google for not being invited into their The Dalles Data Center. He recreates the encounter step by step which is basically a non-encounter with a data center and it clearly wrecks his narrative, yet he still felt compelled to include the whole event. Meanwhile, he has glowing descriptions of Facebook (albeit muted glowing) for being allowed to tour their Prineville Data Center. The whole thing was enough to sour the experience for me. All I can say is that Blum's criticisms of Google are founded, which is all the more reason why they might not have wanted to let him into their Data Center.Regardless, Blum raises some important points on what the internet is, and even some on what it isnt. In so doing, much of the confusion and misconception surrounding the net is put to rest. The bottom line is if you ever wondered where that packet of information you upload goes when you post to a blog or login to do your online banking then this book may just open your eyes to the reality of the internet."
9,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5548263-mathew-bookworm-smith,2,"Following that cord from your computer to the 'internet' is the general idea behind this book. What would it look like? How does it actually work? Good idea, me thinks. Andrew Blum does a great job at describing it all. But, (yes, a big but)...this would have made a lovely magazine article. As it turns out making a book about it was taking it just a few steps too far.Overall, there is very little to the 'internet'; little variety that is. The internet is huge and spreads across the entire globe, but, as it turns out there is really only wire and a surprisingly low number of routers. This books shows us that...from a dozen different angles.Turns out if you send an email from your computer it goes through your home router, down a wire, to the local provider's router, down some more wire, to an 'exchange' (code for another router), where it goes along some more wire, to another exchange (aka router), along even more wire, to the last router, where it is pushed up a wire to its destination. So, let me sum it up in easy-speak-chant : *clears throat* wire, router, wire, router, wire, router, wire, router...There. That is pretty much the bones of this book. Blum tries to add some interesting guts to these bones, but, he doesn't have much to work with. He describes the uniform routers and wire that make up the internet in extreme detail and poetic prose, but, again I can sum it up in easy-speak-chant:*clears throat* black cable, blinky router lights, yellow cable, blinky router lights, thick cable, blinky router lights, underwater cable, blinky router lights...Even when he starts to describe the people who work on the 'internet', they are surprisingly bland - computer nerds in hoodies leaning over a laptop (they all seem to have very little social skills as well). There is one spark of life when Blum goes on an overnight shift with some blue collar cable layers under the streets of NYC. But, for the most part the IT people sounded very boring.I was left hoping for more. Again, Blum does a great job at describing the limited parts of the internet, I can picture how beautiful a refrigerator sized router can look bathed in the soft glow of fluorescent lights, but, you can only read so much of the same thing. It wasn't his words that were repetitive, it was the content. I'd say read Andrew Blum, but, just not this book.http://bookwormsfeastofbooks.blogspot..."
10,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34486838-fred-platten,1,"wow, this is bad. I thought this was a book about the internet, but it's about the author who injects himself in the narration way too much. Goes on for pages about his hotel rooms and looking things up on the internet. Unbelievable. I think this book falls under ""literary"" non-fiction. I really hate those books."
11,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9873679-matt,4,"I found this book to be engaging and informative, but I would have preferred more description and less philosophizing.An errant squirrel chewing through Mr. Blum's cable wire launches him on a journey to understand the physical nature of the Internet. This takes him from a key site in the origin of the academic internet (Len Kleinrock's IMP at Berkeley) through its transition to anarchic commercial interconnections at sites like MAE East in Tyson's Corner, Virginia, where packets were sometimes routed from finland to Tyson's to Finland again, through the more robust Network Access Points that supplanted the early MAE site and the deep sea fiber cables that link them, and finally to the data centers that house our Facebook profiles and other aspects of our digital selves.This was fascinating stuff, especially Blum's recounting of a new fiber optic link in the Net literally emerging from the sea. But Blum's speculations about the nature of place and the tension between human geography and internet are somewhat distracting. Still, this book is strongly recommended for anyone with an interest in the Internet or communications."
12,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563742-margot,3,"An interesting topic, but it's told in a travelogue style, with far too much personal experience tossed in with the relevant historical context. It felt very happenstance, as if readers could be missing a whole part of the history of the physical structure of the internet just because maybe somebody didn't return a call from Blum.Didn't finish completely."

14,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"Informative account of how some of the physical aspects of the internet works. There's a slight amount of history of the beginnings, as well as a little with communications overall. The book is very much a travelogue of the author searching for the pieces that make the internet. I was surprised to learn it's way more centralized than I believed, mostly for the router network switching points. This was written by a non-computer science person for other non-computer science people. In fact, with the various literary references it's more geared towards people like me who were English majors. If you're well versed in hardware this book probably doesn't give you more info than you already know. I had hoped for a little more info on how the internet actually works, but this was a good start, and fairly readable. Even though the book is already five years old, it isn't very outdated. Perhaps the big network routers are a different brand or model, but overall it's doubtful that the basics of the internet has changed much."
15,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38162411-john-mcchesney-young,4,"Fascinating journalistic account of the physical sure of the internet: where the cables are and where they connect, how they're laid on sea floors, dragged up, and connected together, and where data is stored. Definitely not a book for someone seeking technical details - which I myself wasn't - but a well-written travelogue and history."
16,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47605862-robert-daniel,5,"Fascinating. Wonderful. A delightful read. Insightful. I was anxiously waiting for Andrew Blum's next book - and am happy that ""The Weather Machine"" has been published and reviewed in the Wall Street Journal. Looking forward to reading Andrew's next book.Tubes contains the background to how the Internet really works. Its ""plumbing"" - its wiring, the data centers and servers. An update would be wonderful. "
17,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58834746-eric-spitler,4,Blum makes an entertaining travelogue out of a map and history of the internet. Other reviewers are dissatisfied with the depth of detail. I think Blum meant to provide a sense of what the internet means to humanity along the way of explaining what it actually is.
18,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757736-heather,3,"Around Chapter 4, when Blum visits the Amsterdam Internet Exchange, the book got significantly more interesting to me: where in earlier chapters Blum was focused a lot on background/history and the various things he learned from various key people, the focus here shifts to what he sees. In Amsterdam, it occurs to Blum that he could/should see things in a bit of a different way from the corporate-approved tours he's been getting. He's found a map of data centers in the Netherlands and sees that there are plenty in Amsterdam—so he convinces a routing-table analyst to go on an 8-mile urban hike with him, to see the buildings from the outside. This results in a really pleasing section in which Blum talks about Robert Smithson's ""A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic"" (which I haven't read, but clearly should) and how it argues ""that there is value in noticing what we normally ignore, that there can be a kind of artistry in the found landscape, and its unconventional beauty can tell us something important about ourselves"" (151). So Blum walks and looks, and we get passages like this:Our first data center was visible from the elevated train platform: a menacing concrete bunker the size of a small office building, with worn-out blue window trim, spreading out along a canal connecting to the Amstel River. The late-winter day was gray and damp, and there were houseboats tied up at the edge of the still water. My map indicated that the building belonged to Verizon, but a sign on the door said MFS—the vestigial initials of Metropolitan Fiber Systems, [...] which Verizon had acquired years before. There was clearly no rush to keep up appearances; it seemed, rather, that its new owners preferred the building to disappear. (152)In the next chapter, after visiting a router manufacturer in San Jose, Blum comes back to New York and spends a night watching a crew lay fiber optic cable in lower Manhattan. He talks about how, rather than being something totally new, the Internet infrastructure in a place like New York is layered on/builds off the pre-existing infrastructure from telegraph and telephone systems. This chapter was also super-pleasing to me because Blum talks about two buildings in lower Manhattan that have a telecommunications history—the old Western Union building at 60 Hudson and the old AT&T Building at 32 Avenue of the Americas—one of which is the building where I work. Both buildings are ""art deco palaces"" (it's true) and when they were built, each apparently had its own ""gymnasium, library, training school, even dormitories."" In 1955, the first transatlantic telephone cable went from 32 Avenue of the Americas to London. And now? As Blum puts it of 32 Avenue of the Americas, ""on the twenty-fourth floor is the Internet"" (176). Each of these buildings houses its own Internet exchange, and in that sense, as Blum notes, they're not so different from the other ones he visited: except that they're ""a fact of geography,"" an outgrowth of the New York of the early twentieth century, twenty-first-century spaces ""built upon hundred-year-old telephone infrastructure, nestled between stock exchanges and railroad tracks"" (ibid.). Those middle chapters were the most exciting to me, but the remainder of the book is interesting, too. Blum is a smart and engaging writer, and while the first three chapters sometimes felt like a slog, I was pleased with this book by the end, and quite glad to have read it. "
19,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10280795-julia,3,"Tubes is an eye-opening page turner about the cables, routing stations, and data centers that make up the internet. From the non-descript routing stations on the edges of suburban towns to vast lengths of cable strewn along the sea floor, the author shows that this ethereal internet, 'the cloud', is actually very tangbile and human. In the book, the author takes you on a journey to these router stations, introduces you to the people that lay the underground cables, and even attempts to get into a Google data center. One of the facts I learned that boggled my mind the most is that much of the communication that goes on between America and Europe is done through just 16 strands of fiber optic cable. Imagine, millions of computers communicating using just 16 strands! I know what the speed of light is, but obviously can't comprehend such vast numbers as 300 million meters per second because it still seems incredible that millions of people can communicate through just 16 seperate channels sending light pulses at 300 million meters per second. The book's title, Tubes, is a reference to senator Ted Stevens' metaphor of the internet as a series of tubes. We ridiculed the statement, but actually when you look at the fibers and underground sea cables that make up the backbone of the internet, you will realize that Stevens might deserve a bit more credit. This book detailed beautifully the infrastructure behind the internet, and made me wish I knew more about the protocols that govern the internet, and about other types of infrastructure that we take for granted such as sewage systems, the electric grid, and public transit. Overall, I would recommend this book to anybody who likes learning about the gritty underbellies of complex systems, and wants to know more about what are the physical components the make up the internet."
20,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2399081-brian-howell,4,"I won't argue with some reviews that point out how much Blum inserts himself into the story, and that ""Tubes"" can read more like a whimsical travelogue than an exploration of complex technology. Yes, he's definitely a writer, not an engineer. That said, I appreciate the depth of his research, and the approachable style with which he presents it. For readers with only a cursory understanding of ""how the internet works,"" this is likely to an be engaging and informative book. If you're already a network engineer, or work in any capacity around data centers or ISP's, you're probably not going to learn anything new - but that doesn't make what's written incorrect or superfluous... it just isn't for you. I was captivated in an immediate and personal way by one of the 'hidden histories' that's revealed early on in the book. At the time of reading, I was living a stone's throw from the old MAE-East location, the facility and history of which are described in detail - the crowded telecom closet that served as one of the first internet exchanges, and the underground garage it eventually grew into. The way I experienced my own neighborhood changed immediately! I had no idea that a few years before, more than half of the world's internet traffic was zipping through this banal office building I saw every day. The idea materially changed my perspective of the physical landscape around me. Given how much geography the book covers, there's a chance that could happen for other readers, too, in New York, Cornwall, Oregon, and elsewhere. I would encourage them read it and find out. "
21,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,4,"This was very exciting, in an armchair tech sort of way. The author goes out and visits various physical places where ""the internet"" happens, like major switching hubs, content storage, and the points where submarine communications cables COME OUT OF THE OCEAN LIKE A KRAKEN. As you can probably tell, the last one was a special geeky thrill for me, because that is still something that boggles my mind, and now I want to go on a field trip to Porthcurno (the whole thing sounds delightfully mundane, not only the cable part, like you would go, and people would ask what you did, and you would say ""I looked at a cable and then did nothing for a week. Nothing!"" And not in a relaxing, spa nothing way, but literally nothing.). At any rate, the author then describes all of these places in a fairly accessible way with geeky enthusiasm.I did find it a little odd that he kept framing his descriptions with this theme that ""the typical internet user never thinks about WHERE this stuff is happening,"" which I could believe is true, but rather don't think it's an accurate description that the typical internet user who bothers to read this book never thinks about it. I think about it all the time, and so do a lot of people I know."
22,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685312-pauline,2,"This is quite the interesting subject matter that Blum tackles here. The internet is prevalent through all aspects of our life and many cannot even imagine life without it. How and where does this all begin? This is the question that Blum discusses throughout this informative book. It is quite well written and researched and was a good history lesson on the creation and development of what we now know as the internet. However, it fell a bit flat for me. It read like a magazine article...that never ended. I quite enjoy non-fiction books but something about this particular one just didn't capture my attention. It was one of those books that I would forget what I was reading about as soon as I put it down. This may not be the case for everyone though. It is a highly informative books. So if you want to brush up on internet history knowledge I would recommend this book. Disclaimer: I won this as a Goodreads Firstreads giveaway. "
23,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,3,"This is a mildly interesting idea for a book: the author gets it into his head that he needs to understand the physical structure underlying the Internet and writes a book about his experiences. I understand the basic underpinnings of the Internet in terms of routers, fiber, and data centers, so to me this is much more a travelogue of places the author went and people he met. It's readable and interesting if you like reading or watching about other locations in the world. However, I suspect the author just doesn't understand the abstract nature of computers and what they do. It's ironic given his profession; has the author gotten as interested in the physical structure underlying how books are printed and distributed? The wonder is not so much in how it's done as what you can do with it."
24,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7899418-jonathan-cassie,3,"I liked ""Tubes,"" but in fairness, I wanted to like it a lot more. Blum asked the kind of question I bet a lot of us have asked - exactly where is the Internet? A fair question, and one that most of us don't know the answer to - particularly if we mocked Sen. Ted Stephens' infamous ""it's a series of tubes comment."" Turns out, Stephens was largely right. The question of where the Internet is got Blum to range far and wide and to visit strange buildings whose only purpose is to route Internet traffic, the one place in Cornwall where the transatlantic cable rises from the Atlantic floor and to the lunchroom of a data center.

Our default perception of the infinity of the online world is juxtaposed with the real-world tracing of the tubes that make our world-wide connections. From his own couch to the networking hubs of Palo Alto and MAE-East, onto the worldwide internet exchanges in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London, under the sea with the tubes connecting continents, or even to the data warehouses in remote rural America, Blum takes us to places we've been but never really known.At times, his wonder sounded forced and his findings harder to place in the context of his premise. Overall, he brings us to the places we take for granted on our travels across the Net and shows us where it all fits together--except for the mysterious data center of Google. "

If Alice goes down the Internet rabbit hole, she gets broken into packets, re-routed and reconstituted wherever she is called. Blum tries to invoke the Transcendentalist calling on Emerson and Thoreau in his discourse, but this is not a trip to Walden, rather the transformation of human experience into bits of light.

But, if you are interested in how the Internet began and how it evolved, it is an excellent and entertaining read. Andrew Blum walks the reader through how the internet began as a research project to how it got funded by the U.S. Congress, to how service providers controlled the key network access points until the content providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft decided it was in their best interest to control their own pipes. Reading this, you will understand why by 2010 it became possible for all of us to move to the cloud.The moment of the Internet’s first breath: On October 29, 1969, in a log written in a blue ballpoint pen at the site of Interface Message Processor #1 (UCLA) are these words scrawled over two lines and beside the time code 22:30, ""Talked to SRI (Stanford Research Institute) host to host."" It is the sole documentary evidence of the ARPANET’s first successful transmission between sites.- ""Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet,” by Andrew Blum""‘People think that data is in the cloud, but it’s not. It’s in the ocean.’ -Jayne Stowell, Google [5]Tubes is an exploration of what “the cloud” really is. The author, Andrew Blum, is a non-techie journalist who decided to find out for himself where the physical manifestation of the internet really exists. To his surprise, he discovered that information on the “internet” travels mostly under the ocean, rests in giant data centers that contain millions of spinning hard drives, and that the number of wizards that keep the entire thing functioning is rather small.Let’s dispense with some of the internet myths. First, the military didn’t design it to withstand a nuclear exchange. That might have been a design factor when military thinkers started talking about the original internet concepts back in the early 1960s, but by the time the first nodes communicated with each in 1969, nobody was thinking about it any more.Second, Vice President Al Gore did not invent the internet when he was a senator as internet memes have routinely repeated, but he did sponsor the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 that provided funding to build the first internet on-ramps, called Network Access Points (NAPs). Without that, there might not have been an internet.Bloom starts at the very beginning when a RAND researcher named Paul Baran began thinking about the ARPA net in 1960. He then takes us to UCLA where Leonard Kleinrock supervised the building of the first Interface Message Processor (IMP), ""a modified and military-hardened version of a Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer—‘mini,’ that weighed nine hundred pounds and cost $80,000, the equivalent of nearly $500,000 today.” Bloom describes how in the 1970s, the APARNET was really U.S. Government property that linked defense researchers with ARPA-funded universities. He also describes how the the internet was so small in the 1980s, that the official ARAPNET directory only contained some five-thousand odd names of everyone that operated there.The big milestone came in 1983 when the ARPANET moved from the Network Control Protocol (NCP) to TCP/IP. That is the milestone that changed the Internet from being a walled garden to being an interconnected collection of independent networks. Columbia law school professor Tim Wu described it as “a system of tolerated difference—a system that recognized and accepted the autonomy of the network’s members.”By the 1990s, heavy investment in laying fiber optic cables by companies like MCI, PSI, UUNet, MFS, and Sprint helped the internet grow. When Senator Gore got the High Performance Computing and Communication Act passed in 1991, a new topology emerged. Four locations became the major hubs of the internet:: Sprint NAP in Pennsauken, New Jersey. : Ameritech NAP in Chicago, IL: Pacific Bell NAP in San Francisco, CA : MAE-East NAP in Herndon, VirginiaAccording to Bloom, “The reengineering of the Internet’s topology that was implemented in 1995 was the culmination of a long-term trend away from the idealized distributed network envisioned in the 1960s.”1997 was the next big milestone: the establishment of the Palo Alto Internet Exchange (PAIX). Before 1997, the four NAPs provided a big router that all smaller networks plugged into. The PAIX made it possible that all networks would have their own router located in the same building. And, it didn’t charge by the amount of traffic passed. It charged rent to house the routers in independent cages. At this point, the Internet was controlled by the big service providers and exchanges that were scattered around the world. But in the early 200s, as content providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft started to grow their internet businesses, they started to invest in infrastructure. By 2018, these same content providers surpassed the Internet Backbone provider networks as the largest source if international bandwidth. In 1988, the First Fiber Optic cable connected Europe to America. By 2017, 420 Fiber Optic cables in service stretched over 700,000 miles around the world. [4] Many people refer to data in transit as passing through the cloud. In truth, data in transit is passing under the ocean.According to Bloom, ""With few exceptions, undersea cables land in or near classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Marseille, Hong Kong, Singapore, New York, Alexandria, Mumbai, Cyprus, or Mombasa.” In other words, even though the internet seems vast and endless, you can count the number of significant connection points on two hands.At rest, the data sits in data centers. Data center design is part engineering, weather forecasting, and voodoo black art. The key metric is called “ 'power usage effectiveness,' or ‘PUE,' which is sort of like the gas mileage in a car.” [1] But there a thousand other variable that affect the efficiency and cost of running a data center. The content providers are experts at find the right geographical location to store their customer’s data.One last thing, Blum can turn a phrase. Some of my favorites from this book are""All the 'information superhighway' signs have been taken down.""We no longer visit ‘cyberspace’ """"The Internet may seem to be everywhere—and in many ways it is—but it is also very clearly in some places more than others.""""The Internet has a seemingly infinite number of edges, but a shockingly small number of centers.""The Internet’s structure “is based upon a core of meshed connectivity between world cities on coastal shores“Tubes” is not a must-read for all cybersecurity professionals. Not knowing this material will not hinder your career. But, if you are interested in how the Internet began and how it evolved, it is an excellent and entertaining read. By reading this book, you will see why sometime around 2008, it became possible for all of us to move our own assets to the cloud.Sources[1] ""Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet,” by Andrew Blum, Published by Ecco, 1 January 2012, Last Visited 10 March 2019, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...[2] ""How Big Is the Internet of Things?

The next July, he sent out a detailed request for proposals to 140 different technology companies to build what he at first called the “ARPA net.” 1967:A young computer scientist named Larry Roberts—Kleinrock’s MIT office mate—was recruited to ARPA specifically to develop an experimental nationwide computer network.In the summer of 1969: a machine called an interface message processor, or IMP, was installed at the University of California–Los Angeles, under the supervision of a young professor named Leonard Kleinrock.would begin at four universities, all in the west: UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, the University of Utah, and the University of California–Santa Barbara.Under Kleinrock’s direction, UCLA would have the added task of hosting the Network Measurement Center, responsible for studying the performance of this new creation.Indeed, the group assembled in his lab that fall formed a core group of Internet hall of famers:Vint Cerf - who cowrote the Internet’s most important operational code—what is known as the TCP/IP protocol—with Steve Crocker, also Kleinrock’s student, and Jon Postel, who managed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority for years and was a key mentor to an entire generation of network engineers.October 29, 1969: From a small gray archival box resting on top of a file cabinet he pulled out the original log recording the moment when UCLA’s IMP first connected with IMP #2, installed at Stanford Research Institute, late on the Wednesday evening of October 29, 1969.In blue ballpoint pen, the words running over two lines and beside the time code 22:30, was written: Talked to SRI host to host. It is the sole documentary evidence of the ARPANET’s first successful transmission between sites—the moment of the Internet’s first breath.IMP:: a modified and military-hardened version of a Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer—“mini,” : nine hundred pounds and cost $80,000, the equivalent of nearly $500,000 today. The 1970s: ARPANET was US government property, linking defense researchers either within the military itself or at ARPA-funded university departments.1980: The year's edition of the ARPANET directory is a canary-colored perfect-bound book, about the thickness of a fall fashion magazine. It lists the five-thousand-odd names of everyone on the ARPANET, with their postal addresses, the lettered code for their nodes, and their email addresses—absent the “.com” or “.edu,” which wouldn’t be invented for another few years.1982: there were only 15 networks, or “autonomous systems,” on the Internet1985: there were 2,000 computers with access to the Internet;  1 Jan 1983: In a transition years in the planning, all the host computers on the ARPANET moved from NCP, or “Network Control Protocol,” to TCP/IP, or “Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.” The ARPANET was no longer a walled garden with an official government directory of participants, but rather had become just one network among many, linked together into an “Internetwork.” Each network acts independently, or “autonomously,” because TCP/IP gives it the vocabulary to interact. Columbia law school professor Tim Wu points out, this is “a system of tolerated difference—a system that recognized and accepted the autonomy of the network’s members.”1986: There were more than 400 ""autonomous systems.”1987: there were 30,000 computers in the internet1988: First Fiber Optic cable connected Europe to America [4]1989: there were 159,000 computers on the internet 1990s: Companies like MCI, PSI, UUNet, MFS, and Sprint attracted increasing investment dollars—and used them to dig their own trenches and fill them with the new technology of fiber optics1991: the US Congress had passed the High Performance Computing and Communication Act sponsored by Al Gore, which is why people have said he “invented the Internet,” Among the bill’s provisions was a piece of policy best known by its popular name: the “information superhighway.” The Act funded the construction of “on-ramps” or Network Access Points (NAPs); a place to connect a number of networks together via routers for the purpose of traffic exchange and interoperation.” It would be funded with federal dollars, but operated by a private company. Contracts were eventually awarded for four access points, run by four major telecom players: 1992: At the Tortilla Factory in Herndon, Virginia, Bob Collet, who ran Sprint’s network; Marty Schoffstall, cofounder of PSI; and Rick Adams, founder of UUNET, decided to build a new hub a “Metropolitan Area Exchange.” To indicate its ambition to build several of them around the country, it nicknamed the hub MAE-East. Within a couple years, MAE-East was the crossroads for fully half of all the world’s Internet’s traffic.May of 1993: The National Science Foundation released a solicitation to accommodate and promote the commercialization/privatization of the Internet (NSF93-52). [3] This document mandated the creation of four Network Access Points (NAPs), which were sold via closed bid to the following providers:: Sprint NAP in Pennsauken, New Jersey. The decision to locate the Sprint NAP in a bunker of a building in Pennsauken, ninety miles from New York, was because of the existing facility’s links to the transatlantic undersea cables that landed on the New Jersey shore; it was the gateway to Europe.: Ameritech NAP in Chicago, IL: Pacific Bell NAP in San Francisco, CA : MAE-East NAP in Herndon, Virginia1995: “The reengineering of the Internet’s topology that was implemented in 1995 was the culmination of a long-term trend away from the idealized distributed network … envisioned in the 1960s.”1997: 20 percent of American adults were using the Internet—up from nearly zero a few years before.1997: the Palo Alto Internet Exchange (PAIX) had grown to be the most important building of its kind on the planet. For the Internet to grow, it had to be freed from metered interconnections, carrier interference, and the clogged switches that the National Science Foundation had unwittingly codified with the creation of the network access points. Brian Reid, Digital Equipment Corporation, had the simple idea that networks should connect directly, literally plugging one router into another, rather than all plugging into a single shared machine as at MAE-East and the other network access points. Also, the connections would be “untariffed,” meaning Digital wouldn’t charge by the amount of traffic. Instead it would charge rent, both for the obvious square footage of the “cage” in which customers kept their equipment, but also for the far subtler (and skinnier) piece of air that each wire traversed to connect to another company’s cage.2004: Google goes public; Facebook moves from Zuckerberg’s dorm room to Palo Alto Networks Alto.2010: Google purchases 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan for $1.9 billion, making it the largest US real estate transaction of the year. 111 Eighth also happens to be among the most important network meeting points in the world, and certainly among the top three in New York. Google buying it was a little like American Airlines buying LaGuardia Airport—and claiming it only wanted it for the parking garage.2011: there were 2 billion computers on the internet.2017: 420 Fiber Optic cables in service stretching over 700,000 miles (1.1 million km) around the world. [4]2918: Content provider networks like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon surpassed Internet Backbone provider networks as the largest source if international bandwidth. 2020: Estimated to be 50 billion computers on the internet. [2]2027: Estimated that content providers like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon will will consume over 80% of internet bandwidth. [5]"

In particular, I've never been much interested in gadgets, never been an early adopter of the latest e-thing du jour. Hell, I didn't even get a mobile phone until 2007, and I'm sorely tempted not to replace my current one when it dies.But I loved reading about the finer details of the physical architecture of the Internet (yup, I still capitalize it) in Tubes. Even more, I loved Andrew Blum's descriptions of the people he met on his journey, those who put all the physical components and connections in place.I picked up a hardback of Tubes at a book giveaway hosted by a group of friends who were downsizing their libraries. It looked like an intriguing read, but I didn't pick it up again until several months later, preferring to divert myself with the 1980 German language textbook Deutsch mit Emil, featuring a cartoon frog and his many friends both human and ranine.Minor Spoiler Alert: Blum's title aside, the Internet has multiple centers, not just one. Its most important center is arguably not in Silicon Valley, but in Ashburn, Fairfax County, Virginia, as it was in the early AOL era. Blum visits Ashburn, as well as Internet exchanges in California, New York, Germany, and the Netherlands; undersea cable facilities in England and Portugal; and data centers in the high desert of Oregon (the last and, for me, the most fascinating chapter).The most important information I gleaned from these explorations did not come directly from anything Blum wrote, but from something he implied, intentionally or otherwise. The book was published during the battles over SOPA and PIPA, the legislation that would have overtly killed Net Neutrality and the popular outcry against such bills. In the current round of the struggle to preserve Net Neutrality, the book left me with an appreciation not just of why a free Web is so important, but the stupid router tricks that corporate ISP's might employ to create fast and slow lanes, based on whether and what the content providers are willing and able to pay for speedy delivery.Beyond that, Blum throws in little but dazzling literary feats, like comparing the arcane cabling infrastructure under Manhattan to the apartment tower in J.G. Ballard's 1977 novel High Rise, which I just read a couple of years ago (half-read, actually, because it got too depressing to finish). Writers who can discourse intelligently on both dystopian fiction and cable splicing are brain-candy for me, like having an articulate and knowledgeable customer service agent at a car repair shop. Mr. Blum, I salute you, and I'm gonna give you that fifth star that I almost never give."
35,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19672057-cade,3,"I found the subject very interesting, and I enjoyed being able to picture the physical mechanisms of internet data exchange in a clearer way. I also like learning about large engineering projects, and many of the places in this book qualify. The biggest problem with this book is the author kept trying to wax lyrical and philosophize about some deeper meaning. I don't know if the author was worried the facts weren't engaging enough on their own or he just wanted to indulge a passion for flowery prose. Here are some examples of excessively dramatic and pretentious passages:""When we travel, we fix a place’s meaning in our minds. It is in the eyes of a pilgrim that a holy site becomes holiest. And in being there, he affirms not only the place’s significance but also his own. Our physical place helps us better know our psychic place—our identity.""""We are always somewhere on the planet, but we rarely feel that location in a profound way. That’s why we climb mountains or walk across bridges: for the temporary surety of being at a specific place on the map. But this place happened to be hidden. You could hardly capture it in a photograph, unless you like pictures of closets. Yet among the landscapes of the Internet, it was the confluence of mighty rivers, the entrance to a grand harbor. But there was no lighthouse or marker. It was all underground, still and dark—although made of light.""Those are among the worst examples but the main problem isn't so much the quality of these passages as their quantity. Every few pages it seems the author pauses the exposition to take time to reflect on some deeper meaning and reiterate why the reader should care about the subject."
36,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1554782-mark-lisac,2,"A brilliant idea — find the physical infrastructure of the Internet and describe what it looks like — gets considerably dulled by weak writing and limited scope. Maybe 60 to 100 pages offer interesting glimpses of bundles of cable and racks of routers in unexpected places. The rest of the verbiage is crammed with voluminous peripheral detail like what kind of sandwiches interview subjects were having for lunch, goofy similes, occasional stretched metaphors, travel writing, uninspired philosophizing, other inane digressions, and self-indulgent records of Blum's personal reactions to what he sees. Much of the infrastructure consists of fibre-optic cable; there's no description of that fibre's history or production method, and only a sentence referring to the discovery that information can be sent along these cables in packets of light. An editor could have posed more questions and requested a look at a draft that eliminated the pronoun ""I""; the book reads like Blum was instead encouraged to produce what he did. And he insists on using the benighted construction ""a couple …"" rather than ""a couple of …""However, the book suggests an intriguing possibly irony: what if it was written and edited by and for a generation that learned how to communicate in the Internet age? One wonders what a writer like John McPhee or Michael Lewis would have done with the basically strong subject matter."
37,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9149016-robyn,3,"This is not an ""Idiot's Guide"" about how the internet works, this is a well-crafted description of where the physical internet is, of where the internet wires go after they leave your house. Honestly, I was pretty lost for the first few chapters, and believe Blum should have provided a basic overview of how the internet works in the first chapter, so that everyone reading was on the same page, regardless of their prior internet knowledge. As it is, he provides this basic information over halfway through the book, in Chapter 5: Cities of Light. The real aha! moment for me happened in Chapter 6: The Longest Tubes, and from there, everything else I had read fell into place and everything Blum was trying to share, made sense. I had never considered how we're connected across the world, how I can talk to my aunt in the Netherlands as clearly as I can my boyfriend in the same apartment. Sure, it makes sense that there was something connecting us, and has been since the first transatlantic communication, but I had never once thought of the physicality of it. That there are literally internet cables underneath the water across the ocean, connecting the internet between continents was illuminating. Frankly, I'd be interested in reading a book just about the history of those being put in. After reading Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything where he describes how difficult it is to know anything about the deep sea, I'm seriously so I'm awe. How did we figure out where to lay those tubes?In short, this is a worthy read if you're interested in reading about the more nuanced physical aspects of the internet, but if you're only mildly interested, you can probably get away with reading a wiki article and be satisfied."
38,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,2,"While I learned a little about internet exchanges and data centers, I would say that Blum failed to really get his hands around his project, and this book is ultimately a failure. He set out to identify the physical path of the the electronic signals sent and received on his home network. Blum goes on to visit some interesting sites in describing the hardware and locations that are usually invisible to an internet users. However, he clearly never really found the angle he was looking for, and he lacks the imagination or narrative gift to describe the magic of the mundane. What instead ends up framing his account are a serious of shallow, repetitive questions about what it means to be bound by local geography in a world where distributed networks have largely done away with the importance of specific locations from a logical/computational perspective. Blum comes off as eager but a bit dim, and he never quite manages to connect to human stories behind the building and maintenance of a network or grand visions of an interconnected planet, both angles that would have fitted quite nicely into this work. You can see hints of what was foolishly left on the virtual editors floor in the epilogue, where he mentions some personal anecdotes about the people he met along the way. Had he woven some of that material into the body of the book, it would have been immensely improved. As it stands, this work fell flat. A pity, as I think the subject is inherently interesting."
39,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62309516-mads-hansen,2,"Having searched for books on the history of software, programming, computing and the Internet, Andrew Blum's book about the internet seems to be some of the closest I could get to entering this space. The book which could have added and discussed interesting aspects such as privacy in different jurisdictions, history of the internet and future of the internet instead becomes a weird mixture of travel reports (some quite superficial ones) to odd places like Dalles, the London Docklands etc. and the book completely ignores any deeper discussion and analysis of who controls the internet.I felt I wasted my time a little bit. The language is ok but tends to be pretentious at some point - maybe because the author realises that he needs to write a compelling travel book instead of a technical, political or ethical book about the history, the present and the future of the internet. I was almost shocked when the author emphasise the point: ""the cloud is not actually a cloud but just tubes"" (something like that...) - it's not the level of banality I'd expect from reading a book on such a specific topic!Maybe the author should have just written a short article saying: I tried to do this but most often I ended up being denied access to some of the most vulnerable places of data storage. Surprise Surprise. Instead he drags the same conclusion out on +260 pages..."
40,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7387440-mark-hillick,3,"This is a high-level, interesting book that takes you through (at a high-level) the history of the Internet as a network, mostly in its physical manifestation but also a little logically (good explanation of why peering is important). The book has fun anecdotes like:- an engineer shutting off a router that brought Australia offline- random places (kinda like those on Route 66) that are off the beaten track but key centre points of the information super highway :)- the sudden huge power requirements (in the 90s) of random rooms in nondescript buildings that caused landlords to worry- the medium security of the exchanges versus the crazy Security of the data centres such as Google’s (Google basically shared no information in an Orwellian type visit)- new cables being set-up in far-off random beaches, which resulted in huge changes to people’s’ lives as they’re no connected to the worldThe book is fairly high-level and as an engineer, it was interesting and fun but I wouldn’t say hugely educational. At the end of he day, I feel all network engineers should be familiar with the content and internet history this book provides. Definitely worthwhile reading and great background information of Internet history."
41,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91166715-jack,5,"Contrary to a few reviews I’ve read, I really loved this book… I’ve always been deeply interested equally in technology and infrastructure, and this joins both beautifully. As others have said, Blum is a great writer — he takes cables and wires and data centers and makes them intriguing (dare I say captivating) to read about. At the time of writing this, it’s been quite a while (i.e. years) since I read the book, but the way the author weaves internet infrastructure into a near-adventure (for me) worked flawlessly. It’s fascinating to know that Ashburn, VA is such an important place to the internet… seriously, go to Ashburn on Google Maps and look for places by Equinix — it’s quite the list. Tubes takes something rather mysterious, at least to someone who’s not a network engineer, and weaves it into a tad-adventurous storyline. It’s no complete manual to how the Internet works — if I remember correctly, there’s little about TCP/IP or anything of the like. It’s a book more about the wires themselves and less so about the things that happen on them. But with that restraint I found that it was a wonderful read, complemented with Blum’s pizazz-ish writing style and wide-eyed narration. It might not be for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it."

There is the physical world as always, the world in which we walk and breathe and sleep. But the second world--the virtual world-has come to increasingly predominate our lives.

But how does it all actually work? What are the nodes through which this virtual world touches the physical?Andrew Blum does an admirable job here trying to connect the worlds by following the wires to their ultimate destinations. Drawing from architecture and design, he outlines the tremendous and almost entirely hidden infrastructure that seamlessly connects us to virtually all the information in the world. There are perhaps no dramatic insights from this journey and the quest for the geography of the internet is overly dramatized, but this book is nonetheless a very helpful overview for the uninitiated about what exactly the internet is.Read more at https://znovels.blogspot.com/2019/06/..."

This review is from the point of view of a guy (me) looking for an interesting story that tells me -- in simple, really basic terms -- how an email gets from point A to point B. I simply do not understand, nor do I care about, all the technical mumbo jumbo that other reviewers of this book obsess about, and complain that the author ""glosses over"" or ""gets wrong."" Get over it. Go read a tech manual about some micro chip advances.Is this book amusing? Yes. Does it tell a fascinating story? Yes. So, it turns out, the internet is not some abstract thing. It is real fiber optic cables that stretch across the ocean floors; it is comprised of switches and servers in air cooled rooms (and rooms and rooms and more rooms), in buildings you may drive by and not even know it; it is storage for the cloud; it is a 4G wireless network. It is amazing. And it is physically located all around us. In a brick building by the sea in the UK. In a nondescript office tower next to a nondescript U.S. Highway. What a terrific story, and glossed over technical details be damned!"
44,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81090553-alexandre-rotger-m-ller,4,"I read some sample chapters of this book as part of my degree in Computing and IT. I immediately got a copy of the full book the next day. It makes a really good attempt at describing and explaining the nuts and bolts of the internet, from the cables that run from our router and out of our house, to the vast data centers governed by Google or Facebook. The author managed to access and get a decent description of quite interesting locations, techniques and internet organizations, which are not easily accessible to anyone on a daily basis. Rather than focusing on the complex protocols and standards governing the working of the internet, the book focuses on how the internet looks like at the physical level: cables, servers and ISPs, as well as internet exchange points (IXPs), data centers and even submarine cables. Recommended for both IT students and curious people wishing to get an idea of how the internet works as whole and willing to look at the bigger picture."
45,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32320457-sam-marshall,3,"A bit like  the internet for dummies, Andrew Blum's Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet seeks to lay the literal groundwork of the hardware of the internet in an absurdly non-technical book. Rather than explicitly separating chapters into the basics of how each part of the internet works, Blum places his investigation into the context of a story. In the epilogue he even goes so far as to compare his journey to The Odyssey (partly in jest... I hope). So what are the take-aways from Tubes? Well, if you know nothing about how the internet works, then you will now know a little. There are three important pieces of the internet: tubes--the fier optic cables that carry data between IP addresses, routers/hubs--the places where your data is directed, and data centers--""where data sleeps"". There is also a little bit of history of the internet that is informative particularly for anyone who thinks that Al Gore invented the internet. What this book isn't is technical. Blum spends just as much (if not more) time describing the places he sees and the characters that he meets as he does describing the warehouses and physical properties of the tubes. At points, it can really drag. Tubes reads more like a travel book than an expose of internet hardware. Blum would have done well to consider his audience when writing this book, but if he had he may have found himself short on material!"
46,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55420656-taylor-winslow,4,"While this book sought to break down this very technical history into layman's terms, it is still a very tedious read. That being said, I learned so much about the internet from this book. I feel like I have come away with a more balanced understanding of how our information is transported and stored. Though challenging content to grasp at times, Blum succeeds in writing a necessary analysis of a much-neglected topic, and his writing style is relaxed and steady, helping me to pick away at this book at a nice pace. I like following Blum on his pilgrimage to internet landmarks. The memoir style helps to dilute and neutralize the technical jargon. Overall, I would give this book a try. It's not for everyone, but it remains relevant to everyday life even after I've turned all the pages."
47,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16976290-nathan-vos,4,"The most prosaic tech book I've read. It definitely doesn't get into technical details, as others have already mentioned. It is mostly about the form and human work, rather than function, but it does so very well written. I really enjoyed it.One thing that bothered me though, is that there are no illustrations in the book. Blum gives very visual descriptions of places, in which you can really sense his architectural background, and those seem to matter more to him than the technologies that are at work. He even mentions taking photographs in quite a few places, but none of those is in the book. That just seems like a lost opportunity to me."
48,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83680325-jennifer-gottschalk,3,"If you've ever wondered how exactly 'the Internet' works, this is the book for you. Blum carefully traces the various 'tubes' that make up the Internet and explains exactly how this thing we call the Internet actually works. At times I found reading this 'hard going' but at the same time it was worth the effort. There were some surprises along the way (for instance, the fact that data travels down fiber optic cables at the speed of light) and whilst networking is not my passion, reading 'Tubes' left me with a deeper understanding of what actually happens when I upload my precious 'stuff' to the cloud."
49,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1422555-kristen,3,"3.5 stars“I have confirmed with my own eyes that the Internet is many things, in many places. But one thing it most certainly is, nearly everywhere, is, in fact, a series of tubes. There are tubes beneath the ocean that connect London and New York. Tubes that connect Google and Facebook. There are buildings filled with tubes, and hundreds of thousands of miles of roads and railroad tracks, beside which lie buried tubes. Everything you do online travels through a tube. Inside those tubes (by and large) are glass fibers. Inside those fibers is light. Encoded in that light is, increasingly, us.”"
50,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19012920-chris,4,"Hard to get into originally, but once I embraced what he was describing (and having some extra time on my hands) it opened up into a wonderful story of how ""the internet"" is built. Why certain nodes on the internet are geographically where they are are extremely interesting and helped paint a broader narrative for the internet as a whole. The ""plumbing"" of the internet is not where you'd think it would be or built in the manner that it is, but this was a highly interesting read that details it out! Highly recommend it."
51,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1408078-david,3,"Blum decides to get out from behind his computer to try to find the Internet. He realizes this is an impossible task since the Internet, by definition, is everywhere, but off he goes. He visits exchanges, data centers, places where intercontinental cables come ashore or dive under the water. The engineering involved that makes the Internet hum is more than impressive. And the volume of data flying around the globe is incredible. Learn a little bit about what makes the Internet what it is and meet the geeks who make it happen."
52,0061994936,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2194759-kevin-furr,3,"Fairly informative exploration into Internet infrastructure. But it really seemed more like a long Wired article than a book. As a study of technology culture certainly did not have the depth or magic of ""The Soul of a New Machine"" or ""Showstoppers"", whose writers were embedded with developers for some period of time, whereas Blum only made short visits to people and places in his research. In summary, Blum paints a picture of 1) Internet exchanges, where lots of network operators connect to each other in a big mixmaster, 2) on-shore landings of undersea cables, and 3) data centers."

I did find the personalities somewhat interesting, but for the most part except for learning where many of these facilities are located, I don't think there was too much information there."
