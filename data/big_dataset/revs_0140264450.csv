0,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3850379-vasha7,3,"The Origins of Virtue is a non-technical discussion of the evolutionary aspects of cooperation and altruism. That being an extremely complex subject (and still very much an active area of research), a short book like this can only skim the surface. Although I've read other books, magazine articles, and blog posts, there were some things here that were new to me. For example, the pair of chapters introducing game theory are better than other introductory articles I've seen, which (surprisingly) generally don't go beyond the point in the history of computer simulations where the Tit-for-Tat strategy came to prominence: Ridley describes how, as simulations became more realistic, Tit-for-Tat turned out not to be the single most stable strategy after all. But then, a single simple solution is easier to present in a short article, whereas here he has thirty pages to develop the point that will be repeatedly made throughout the book: that a (temporarily) stable solution is a delicate balance of competing interests, adjusted by natural selection and highly dependent on ecological circumstances.As the subtitle indicates, Ridley is constantly returning to the subject of ""human instincts"". People who doubt that instincts can be directly selected for reproductive strategizing, or who want methodological caution, will be dissatisfied here: Ridley pretty much takes evolutionary psychology for granted. He starts off the book by invoking nineteenth-century social theorists Peter Kropotkin and Adam Smith, but mostly he cites famous twentieth century work in economics and anthropology; psychological research is brought in to a much lesser extent. The references in the endnotes are a mixture of academic works and other semi-popular books.At several points Ridley argues against a ""noble savage"" idea, pointing out that people aren't virtuous because virtue is directly built into them, but because they're (selected to be) able to recognize that living in a virtuous society where you can usually trust strangers is good for them (it seems that humans are the only species that can go that far, not only making fair deals, but using general virtue to promote a far larger cooperative society). Cheating is short-sighted, cooperation allows greater gains. There are discussions of what social circumstances promote and undermine this; it's always a balance. Ridley is somewhat pessimistic about the possibility of ecological virtue, which is not an inborn love of the land but rather a much more difficult problem in far-sightedness. However, it has not proved impossible to solve some problems of destructive self-interest, perhaps this one is not impossible either.Ridley gets into politics somewhat, with a recurring theme being an argument against coercive institutions, whether they be monarchs or large bureaucratic governments. He is attempting to demonstrate that fluid agreements between individuals or small collectives are far more likely to work to everyone's advantage. This goes for property ownership too: he argues that people can't properly care for land or resources that are nobody's, or held by a very large collective ownership. These themes, like everything else in this short work, are not developed in much detail.This book covers all the main aspects of its topic, and lays out the basis that beginners will need in order to go further in the field. Ridley writes well and explains his points very comprehensibly, though at the cost of simplification. His greatest flaw is that he takes an excessively confident tone, often presenting a disputed issue as if it was settled. Let me not be excessively negative. I hope that people who finish this good but incomplete book will go on, if not to read some primary sources, at least to seek out other popular works with different perspectives. "

All that.Attempts to answer the question ""Why are people nice?""Quotes:""Animals are designed to do things not for their species, or for themselves, but for their genes.""""There had come the realization that the genome wasn't the monolithic data bank plus executive team devoted to one project - keeping oneself alive, having babies - that I had hitherto imagined it to be. Instead, it was beginning to seem more a company boardroom, a theatre for a power struggle of egotists and factions . . . I was an ambassador ordered abroad by some fragile coalition, a bearer of conflicting orders from the uneasy masters of a divided empire.""""The deed is what counts.""""Think of it: zillions and zillions of organisms running around, each under the hypnotic spell of a single truth, all these truths identical, and all logically incompatible with one another: 'My hereditary material is the most important material on earth; its survival justifies your frustration, pain, even death'. And you are one of these organisms, living your life in the thrall of a logical absurdity.""""Social benefits derive from individual vices. The cooperation and progress inherent in human society are the result not of benevolence, but of the pursuit of self-interest. Selfish ambition leads to industry; resentment discourages aggression; vanity can be the cause of acts of kindness.""""To reduce the complexity of life to a silly game is the kind of thing that gets economists a bad name. But the point is not to try squeeze every real-life problem into a box called 'prisoner's dilemma', but to create an idealized version of what happens when collective and individual interests are in conflict. You can then experiment with the ideal until you discover something surprising and then return to the real world to see if it sheds light on what really happens.""""The Western Front was 'plagued' by unofficial truces between Allied and German units that had been facing each other for some time. Elaborate systems of communication developed to agree terms, apologize for accidental infractions and ensure relative peace - all without the knowledge of the high commands on each side.""""The bigger the society in which the individual lives, the bigger its neocortex relative to he rest of the brain. To thrive in a complex society, you need a big brain. To acquire a big brain, you need to live in a complex society.""""Gift giving in a tribal society, where the object is to put somebody else under an obligation, is not gift giving at all; it is exploiting a reciprocal instinct.""""Moral sentiments are problem-solving devices designed to make highly social creatures effective at using social relations to their genes' long-term advantage. They are a way of settling the conflict between short-term expediency and long-term prudence in favour of the latter.""""The virtuous are virtuous for no other reason than that it enables them to join forces with others who are virtuous, to mutual benefit.""""The neighbouring or rival group, however defined, is automatically an enemy. Argentinians and Chileans hate each other because there is nobody else nearby to hate.""""There was morality before the Church; trade before the state; exchange before money; social contracts before Hobbes; welfare before the rights of man; culture before Babylon; society before Greece; self-interest before Adam Smith; and greed before capitalism.""""So let us examine the individualists' case: that government is the problem, not the solution. The collapse of community spirit in the last few decades, and the erosion of civic virtue, is caused in this analysis not by the spread and encouragement of greed but by the dead hand of Leviathan. The state makes no bargain with the citizen to take joint responsibility for civic order, engenders in him no obligation, duty or pride, and imposes obedience instead. Little wonder that, treated like a naughty child, he behaves like one."""
3,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Hmmm, The Origins of Virtue is an interesting examination of the possible evolutionary causes of virtue, mostly defined here as altruism. It works quite well as a supplement that falls somewhere in between three of my current classes on Coursera: one with an anthropological bent, one largely genetic, and one about morality. It draws some of those themes together quite well, for me, and explains some of the studies -- and some of the pitfalls of the studies, and wishful thinking.It's also pretty well written: it's divided into both chapters and sections, which makes it easy to digest and keeps the argument focused.On the other hand, it's a little old now (1996), and Ridley's ideology is very obvious to the attentive reader, although camouflaged by his scientific tone. At least the last chapter unveils his ethical principles: anti-government, anti-socialism (including such familiar institutions to Brits as the NHS), pro-small collectives and curated communal living. To be fair, he does analyse some of the ways this falls down, but he mostly focuses on why government-run things doesn't work.I mean, I love the NHS unashamedly. I went from the diagnosis of gallstones to medication to having my gallbladder removed in the process of a couple of months, without paying for anything at the point of use, at a time when I couldn't support myself and was in agonising pain. Throughout my life I'll pay back into that system with my taxes, and I don't begrudge it at all, whatever Ridley's conclusions told him."
4,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"The book opens with a daring jail break. The story notes that the person escaping the grim Russian prison is, in fact, a member of the nobility, one of the Czar's favorites when the escapee was much younger. The person breaking out, of course, is Peter Kropotkin, the anarchist prince. However, it is not his philosophy so much as his work in natural history that drew Matt Ridley's attention. Kropotkin, on an exploration of Siberia, observed what he saw was cooperation among multitudinous animal species. He drew from that the conclusion that Huxley, who had described nature as ""red in tooth and claw,"" was missing an important part of the evolution picture--the evolution of cooperation. And this leads to Ridley's thesis in this well written volume (page 5): ""Society works not because we have consciously invented it, but because it is an ancient product of our evolved predispositions. It is literally in our nature."" He goes on to note that (page 5): ""This is a book about human nature, and in particular the surprisingly social nature of the human animal."" The volume proceeds by reviewing theories and research on cooperation, evolution, and so on, a wide ranging review of the human condition and of our evolutionary impulses. He notes that our primate relatives set the stage for understanding the evolution of human cooperation. He notes the importance of a game, adopting game theory, developed by political scientist Robert Axelrod, in which humans will cooperate unless double crossed, at which point individuals will respond in negative kind. But, according to some theorists, as long as individuals are willing to cooperate with one another, they will get cooperation in return. His conclusion is intriguing (page 264): ""If we are to recover social harmony and virtue, if we are to build back into society the virtues that made it work for us, it is vital that we reduce the power and scope of the state."" He calls for (page 265) "". . .social and material exchange between equals for that is the raw material of trust, and trust is the basis for virtue."" All in all, an intriguing and interesting volume. Not all, of course, will be convinced of the thesis. But it is a well written effort to integrate many different bodies of work to make his point. "
5,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586065-paul,4,"A fascinating and wide-ranging exploration of human nature, and how it has evolved biologically and culturally. It’s mostly a happy story – as a species we are cooperative, social, sharing, trading and we divide the labor so that we all have more. There’s a darker side too: we are fiercely and often irrationally (and violently) tribal. And underlying it all is the unpleasant (to many) truth that self-interest drives the whole thing – probably at the level of our genes, but certainly at the level of individual and family. The good news is that successful societies have evolved structures that channel the basic self-interest into cooperative, win-win outcomes, and generally without the direction of a sovereign or state. As Ridley shows, “…there was morality before the Church; trade before the state; exchange before money; social contracts before Hobbes; welfare before the rights of man; culture before Babylon; society before Greece; self-interest before Adam Smith; and greed before capitalism.” Indeed, most of the conclusions are the same as Smith’s – from The Theory of Moral Sentiments as well as Wealth of Nations – but with the benefit of an additional 250 years of history and science to support them. Ridley is a great pleasure to read. "

9,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12807932-b-j-richardson,4,"This book sets out to demonstrate that ""there was morality before the church, trade before the state, exchange before money, social contracts before Hobbes, welfare before the Rights of Man, culture before Babylon, society before Greece, self-interest before Adam Smith, and greed before capitalism."" By the title, you would think this is a book about the origins of virtue, but really the primary focus is on only two virtues he focuses on are altruism and cooperation. When he is doing so, Matt Ridley is excellent. He pieces together the fields of biology, game theory, the animal kingdom, and some history and sociology to demonstrate why and how from a behavioral evolutionary standpoint, we act the way we do. I understand that such a large task there is no way to include all the facts, details and theories that are out there, but Ridley does tend to use a selective inclusion of facts that make his case seem much stronger than it really is. For example, he demonstrates how and why fashions and fads can come into being, but by his logic, there would be no reason for those fads to ever change. I wonder what Malcolm Gladwell would have to say to that. Things are a bit more complicated than Ridley would like. Another example that jumped right out at me because theology is my strong point was when he was talking about how early Judaism was an exclusive religion. He states that ""The Ten Commandments apply to the Israelites but not to heathen people."" He then gives an example of Joshua winning a battle in Ai and celebrating by making a stone copy of the Ten Commandments that include ""Thou shalt not kill."" Matt Ridley should have read to the end of the chapter before trying to paint Judaism as an affair exclusively of adult Hebrew men. In Joshua 8:35 it specifically says that all the women, children, and foreigners were included in this celebratory reading of the Law. A few different times, I caught subtle hints at racism or, at least, an air of Western superiority. One such example I noted was: ""A South African crowd making a political demonstration and jogging in place is much closer to its evolutionary roots than a ballroom of Viennese waltzing the night away."" No explanation or reason is given. It is simply assumed his readers will immediately, unquestioningly agree. The same idea also comes out when talking about cultures and people groups that have only recently come into contact with the West. It is assumed that they have not evolved or changed in any way for thousands, or tens of thousands of years and that we can understand from their 19th or 20th-century behavior how Homo Erectus must have acted. Anyways, I am still giving this book four stars because there is a lot of great information here and this would be a good introductory book on behavioral evolution. I would just strongly recommend that you read it with both eyes open."
10,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45259248-yasmina,4,"My overall impression of the book: This book is by far the most comprehensive account on the evolution of human morality I have yet to read. Ridley consummately brings together knowledge and narratives from biology, zoology, history (e.g. ancient Rome), and contemporary society (e.g. extant hunter-gatherer societies) to bring depth and volume to the subject matter. His book is informative from a socio-historical perspective, evolutionary perspective, zoological perspective, and even genetic perspective. It is a multi-disciplinary work that’s well synthesized. The amount of detail he includes and the fact that he approaches the subject from an innumerable number of angles is impressive and highly informative. You can tell Ridley is observant, cultivated, and insightful. His keen eye for detail finds connections where others cannot. Ridley has a PhD in Zoology and it shows. He references many ethological reports to elucidate how the evolution of human morality is similar to or divergent from the evolution of similar traits in other animals. Chapter 1, bringing to light a molecular, “Russian doll,” biological view of cooperation, had me stunned. It remains my favourite chapter in the book. Ridley also seems to have a talent for story telling. The book is lively and exciting to read, with analogies as well as interesting, albeit true, narratives around every corner. Lots of historical evidence and ancient anecdotes substantiate his claims while also bringing life to the book. His carefully crafted analogies serve their purpose well and elucidate the subject matter. The historical quotes he uses from prominent figures at the beginning of every chapter and every so often in the text, often to demonstrate the thinking of a particular philosophical tradition or time, are astutely chosen and entertaining to read. They resonate with you and make you think.  Some cons: A few of his ideas are outdated. This is understandable given the book was published in 1998. One should read this classical, seminal work knowing that this may be the case. Still, most of his ideas remain viable. The book must have been revolutionary at its time, even though the understanding of the subject matter has advanced a bit since then. Ridley was the pioneering theorist that brought forth the unorthodox paradigm of viewing morality as an evolved trait and he should be congratulated for this. I would argue this book remains the “gold standard” to read for an introductory, sweeping overview of the subject. The book is clearly, elegantly, and conscientiously written, though at times the writing can get a bit superfluous, ambiguous, redundant, and could use some condensing. His english is a little old but definitely manageable to read.There were a few of his rationalizations or viewpoints that I did not necessarily agree with. For example, he puts forth several claims about evolved differences between the sexes that have the potential to be overgeneralized or exaggerated by readers. I did not feel that he sufficiently cautioned the reader against overgeneralizing or stereotyping; he could have managed this with a little more poise. Still, this quote, one of my favourites in the book, may slightly acquit him:“There is, incidentally, abundant material for those who like stereotypes here, but none of it says anything about the woman’s place being in the home. After all, the argument goes that men and women both went out to work in the Pleistocene, one to hunt, the other to gather. Neither activity was remotely like trooping off to an office and answering telephones all day. Both sexes are equally unsuited to that” (p. 95). Ridley ends the book by listing several political implications of his findings. I felt that some of his political conclusions were rushed and misplaced (e.g. he concludes that socialist, welfare, or likened states cannot be viable, effective forms of government conducive to the growth and prosperity of society). He is definitely a capitalist, free-market enthusiast, and governmental minimalist. Still, he is not naive enough to think that government is all-together unnecessary, though some of his political ideas arguably reached the brink of anarchy. I believe a crucial point eluded him: Larger societies inherently require stricter governments because, at that scale, individuals cannot effectively police everyone’s actions, remember and recognize every individual, and remain in contact with one another on a consistent basis. Because of this increased anonymity in larger societies, defection is a lot easier. Hence, larger societies inherently require more a forceful central authority to police transactions, big and small.This aside, I do like that he ended the book with political suggestions derived from his findings on the evolution of human morality and nature. At the same time, I felt that this was out of the book’s scope and beyond the author's experience to give political advice with such vehemence. Moreover, the evidence he cites in support of his political views were correlational though construed as causational.Additional thoughts: I found Chapter 11, “Ecology as Religion,” to be an especially interesting read given he presents us with such an unorthodox view of environmental conservatism and environmental ethics. He brings an air of realism to the subject that is fresh, captivating, and jaw-dropping at times. It would be interesting to have environmental conservatists read this chapter and gauge their thoughts/reactions. Below are quotes that I believe summarize the book’s main conclusions, all taken from Chapter 13 (the final chapter). Do not read these if you want the book to surprise you: “Our minds have been built by selfish genes, but they have been built to be social, trustworthy, and cooperative. That is the paradox this book has tried to explain.”“We owe our success as a species to our social instincts; they have enabled us to reap undreamt benefits from the division of labour.”“Human beings have [both] instincts that foster the greater good and others that foster self-interested and anti-social behaviour. We must design a society that encourages the former and discourages the latter.”“I have argued that there was morality before Church; trade before the state; exchange before money; social contracts before Hobbes; welfare before the rights of man; culture before Babylon; society before Greece; self-interest before Adam Smith; and greed before capitalism. These things have been expression of human nature since deep in the hunter-gatherer Pleistocene.” “Society works not because we have consciously invented it, but because it is an ancient product of our evolved predispositions. It is literally in our nature.” (From the back cover)Ridley’s conclusions may seem obvious after-the-fact, but he takes a very arduous, diligent path to get there (and he does so elegantly). Quite frankly, these conclusions are not so obvious. This is evidenced by the continuous philosophical debates on human nature that have gone on and on for decades, arguably even centuries (i.e. “are humans inherently ‘good’ or ‘bad’?”). By brilliantly orchestrating the findings of geneticists, psychologists, biologists, sociologists, economists, philosophers, and anthropologists, Ridley finally supplies us with the well-researched account we have been awaiting.Side note: If you plan on reading this book, I recommend that you simultaneously grab the Evolution of Cooperation by Axelrod, a perfect complement."
11,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,4,"This book extends the arguments about the genetic basis of behavior from the rest of the animal kingdom (familiar to readers of Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"") into human behavior, the appearance of cooperation and altruistic actions, and the unique nature of human society. The author, Matt Ridley, is good at engaging the reader, with many examples drawn not only from biology, but from diverse fields, including opera (the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" chapter begins with the plot story for Puccini's ""Tosca""). Ridley argues that human society is best when government and social structures tap into the genetic understanding of human behaviors to encourage the best from us. Perhaps not surprisingly from an author who wrote the science and technology column for the Economist, Ridley resolves that government is best when it is small - although I think this conclusion to be the weakest section of the book. There is much of interest to learn within these pages, and Ridley makes the experience enjoyable and worthwhile."
12,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21906020-mark-colenutt,5,"Matt Ridley was educated at Oxford and is a journalistic scientist, which means he is able to translate the more complicated scientific breakthroughs and understandings to the wider public in a clear and succinct manner.Almost anything he has written, including his Guardian articles, are worthy of a reader's time. This particuar publication is a brave attempt to explain why we are nice to each other. Is it from some altruistic human capacity or is it more a genetic survival technique? We are taught not to look a gifted horse in the mouth and yet that is the first thing a tribal nomad will do, well aware that if he is being given something then his friend will expect something in return.His hypotheses are tested against a plethora of animal studies from ants to dophins who all collaborate for different gains.For those who fell asleep during all those afternoon wildlife documentaries then this publication is a masterclass in animal behavourism with an array of surprising facts that few documentaries would dare publish. A must then, for those interested in evolutionary biology."
13,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312307-ryan,3,"It was hard for me to get through the first couple of chapters mainly because I don't agree with the basic premise of the book: that we have evolved from nothing into something. I actually underlined all the times Ridley used the language of intelligent design (accidentally, I assume) to describe some evolutionary process.But starting with Chapter 3 -- The Prisoner's Dilemma -- the book gets much better. It's about game theory and how humans make decisions when placed under various cost/benefit parameters. Human behavior is what it is regardless of our origins.The end of the book is especially good. This is where Ridley explains ""the tragedy of the commons"" and how government produces less-than-ideal outcomes when compared to communities that lack an autocratic government.Stylistically, Ridley is a great writer, so reading this book is pleasurable -- even if you disagree with some (or many) of the author's viewpoints."
14,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2882673-john-vibber,4,"This book poses a puzzle: Is virtue an instinctual property built into our selfish genes? And if so, how do we reconcile our tribal tendencies with the trust we extend to others? You might think such thorny questions best explained by anthropologists, but Matt Ridley the biologist/economist wouldn't agree.  His thesis is based on several lines of research which weigh traditional and emerging beliefs about human nature. Traditionally he asks if we are noble savages constrained by society or distrustful savages constrained by government. In other words, are we the intellectual decedents of Rousseau or Hobbs? And if neither, what has modern science taught us about evolution and human goodness?  I found this a somewhat technical read, but worth the effort. I like how Ridley addresses difficult questions. In the end, his perspective increased my optimism about human nature."
15,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"Lively, biased, and a whole lot of funMatt Ridley nicely demonstrates here that there is no such thing as virtue and that altruism is an oxymoron. Instead it is all reciprocity and enlightened self-interest. This reminds me of when I was a sophomore in college. We used to argue passionately about three things: the nature of women, whether the Pope believed in God, and whether it was possible to act otherwise than in one's own self-interest. We concluded that women were an enigma wrapped in a mystery, etc.; that it wasn't clear whether the Pope believed in God or not; and that, barring mistakes, we always acted in our own self-interest. We further concluded that ""altruism"" was a word without real meaning, that the Pope was an amoral political animal, and that women were, regardless of their nature, very interesting. But we were sophomores. Matt Ridley is all grown up, and what interests him in this book is not so much the origin of virtue (although he does get heavily into that) but the restoration of the conservative agenda. Alas. He argues from biology (our nature) to what ought to be politically. This is doubly ""alas"" because Ridley preaches mightily against this very delusion, calling it a ""reverse naturalistic fallacy"" (p. 257). David Ricardo and Adam Smith are brought into the fray, Hobbes and Machiavelli. Ridley takes arguments from game theory and political science and the world of high finance to make his point that virtue as it is ordinarily understood does not exist. He goes on to call for less government and more local autonomy, a return to a dream state of ""everything small and local"" (p. 264). As he does, Ridley comes dangerously close to taking on all the trappings of a right wing radio talk show host, spouting the virtues of Newt Gingrich and Margaret Thatcher on his way to becoming something like a high-toned Rush Limbaugh.Alas, how sharp was his rapier and how telling his prose when Ridley stuck to revealing our social and sexual hypocrisy as he did so delightfully in The Red Queen (1993); but how obvious are his prejudices when he steps into the political arena. He actually argues that tried old irrelevancy of the embarrassed right wing, that even though Hitler was bad, very bad, he was better than Stalin. Thus on page 258 we have (referring to the doctrine of acquired characteristics embraced by the Soviet state): ""Unlike the genetic determinism of Hitler, Stalin's environmental variety went on to infect other peoples."" Ridley even argues that Hitler got his ideas from the communists. ""Hitler was merely carrying out a genocidal policy against ‘inferior', incurable or reactionary tribes that Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels had advocated..."" (p. 253). So caught up in his cause is Ridley that he begins to contradict himself and argue for the kind of idyllic fantasy world that he condemns in Rousseauians. Thus in his chapter entitled ""The Power of Property"" he waxes nostalgic for the ""egalitarian"" conservation systems of New Guinea fishermen and Maine lobster men before the interference of big government. On page 262 he talks about ""The collapse of community spirit in the last few decades, and the erosion of civic virtue...caused"" by ""the dead hand of the Leviathan."" But on the very next page he declares, ""I hold to no foggy nostalgia that the past was any better. Most of the past was a time of authority, too...""Yes, Matt, it was. The authority of the gang lords, of the feudal lord, of a system of social, political and economic imprisonment so oppressive that the average person never got further than a few miles from the place of his birth and had little to no chance of rising above the economic and social station of his birth. It was ""small and local"" with a vengeance. The tyranny of the feudal lords in Europe and, e.g., the war lords in China is conveniently ignored in Ridley's political fantasy. He claims that we have it better today only because of superior technology (p. 263) forgetting that our system of representative democracy in Republican form is also an improvement over the absolutism of the tribe. The sad lesson here is, that even a man as adroitly talented and as intelligent as Matt Ridley becomes just another propagandist when he ventures into an area in which he is emotionally involved.Still there is a lot to enjoy in The Origins of Virtue. His discussion of the prisoner's dilemma is the best I've read, although his analysis of the ""wolf's dilemma"" (p. 55) is faulty. I won't go into it here, but ""the tiny chance"" that he refers to is overwhelmed by the fact that each player has only a five percent chance of ""winning"" by pushing his button since he has to beat 19 others to the punch. Consequently the best strategy is the obvious, don't push that button! (But check this out for yourself.) His discussion of how the division of labor has enriched our world is interesting; his analysis of how we detect cheaters and how that is an instinctive human talent is persuasive; and his delineation of the nature of gift giving and receiving and how it relates to our innate sense of reciprocity is valuable as it shines light on the nature of ""virtue."" In fact, his entire argument is eminently worth reading. His glorification of trade (with which I agree) and his put down of ecologists (with which I disagree) is tolerable. Most fun though--recalling the Matt Ridley of The Red Queen--is in all the sacred cows he slaughters along the way: the New World Indians (ouch!), Margaret Mead, the so-called ""tragedy of the commons"" theory, the Noble Savage, even poor Chief Seattle is revealed as a slave-owner whose public reputation is largely the product of a screenwriter's imagination (p. 214). --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
16,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2247716-anthony,5,This book should definitely be on your short list of books to read if you are at all interested in what makes us humans behave as we do. It is one among many recently published books on evolutionary psychology -- and it's one of the very best. What distinguishes Ridley's book from the pack is his explicit grappling with the question: What does the fact that human moral sentiments are crafted by natural selection imply about the appropriate political order? I definitely want and need to read it again.
17,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,4,"Nature or nurture? It’s a question as old as philosophy, and it is an ongoing discussion in our current world. Matt Ridley tackles this question from the perspective of evolutionary biology (a subject on which he has authored several books) in The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation. In answering the question, he doesn’t vary far from the “selfish gene” concept, but he uses illustrations from anthropology, biology, economics, history, and horticulture (among others) to express his point. But even more than retreating to the “selfish gene” idea, Ridley’s point is discovering where cooperation originates. Expressing an anti-Thomas Hobbes’ idea of Leviathan, Ridley asserts, “Covenants without swords work; swords without covenants don’t.” (p. 240) Indeed, though Ridley cites certain medieval and rustic covenants which governments messed up, he does seem to favor a social contract more like Thomas Scanlon’s What We Owe Each Other (though he doesn’t quote Scanlon directly).Now, of course, there is that genetic imperative of DNA survival, so it is not surprising that organisms cooperate in matters regarding the future of the organism. For example, Ridley notes that there is a slime mold comprised of circa 100 K different amoebic organisms. Generally, they function as separate entities until circumstances become too unpromising for the individual organism. That’s when they join together and form the slime mold. They come together in a growing and growing mound that eventually falls over of its own instability. When it falls over, it releases a section of the mass which functions as a slug and seeks more hospitable territory. Failing to find that, the slug increases density in the middle, creating a rising mound that eventually erupts into a ball of cells, rising on a slender strand that seems almost analogous to the concept of a space elevator. Eventually, the ball releases into about 80 K different spores in the immediate atmosphere so that they can be inadvertently picked up by insects and carried to more hospitable environs (p. 16). Certainly, that is “cooperation,” but it is not intentional cooperation.Moving slightly up the food chain, the value of reciprocity—even in less conscious beings can be illustrated in the way sticklebacks approach feeding grounds near their natural predators, pike. To gauge whether the pike is hungry or sated, the stickleback move forward in pairs in small segments. One of the pair takes the risk of venturing forward first. If the pike doesn’t move, they are safe to feed. If the pike does move, both sticklebacks retreat swiftly. Of course, the bolder fish is more likely to be devoured by the pike. But here’s the interesting thing, if one of the pair is gauging the pike with another who has switched off the role of scout with the other, both sticklebacks will be bolder. If the partner hasn’t demonstrated reciprocity in the past, the bolder fish doesn’t engage in nearly as much risk (p. 79). Even though we cannot assign conscious reciprocity to these fish, there seems to be an innate process of such that goes on.Another curious example from nature is the idea from the late Glyn Isaac that the cultural importance of food-sharing among humans is likely evolved from the tolerance of opportunistic food thieves in nature. After all, lions help themselves at a lion “feast,” even if they haven’t killed the prey. Chimpanzees share food, but there is a social pecking order where some must beg for it before it is given. For humans, especially in primitive tribes sharing, say, a giraffe carcass, there is a sense that the food must be offered to them after the successful hunter has enjoyed of it what the hunter and family want (p. 111).Ridley has a way of pointing out the hereditary selfishness of humanity in a number of clever ways. For example, he covers the selfishness of ambitious office politics and self-preservation with an account from the famous C. Northcote Parkinson (of “Parkinson’s Law” fame). Parkinson observed that a bureaucrat wants subordinates, not rivals. So, to accommodate that desire, bureaucracy keeps making new work requiring new bureaucrats such that the bureaucracy itself keeps expanding. Illustrative of this was that: “With delicious irony, Parkinson described the quintupling of the number of civil servants in Britain’s Colonial Office between 1935 and 1954, during which time the number and size of colonies to be administered shrank dramatically.” (p. 27) I found it refreshing that even though Ridley approaches such issues from a scientific view, he has little patience for non-scientific dogma found so often in academia today. He rants against anthropologists being so politically correct that they ignore evidence for universal sexual division of labor (pp. 92, 93) He has little patience with the efforts of Karl Marx, Max Weber, Jeremy Bentham, and most modern anthropologists to ignore the significance of trade among primitive peoples (pp. 109-202). It is also refreshing that even Ridley recognizes that a broad, simplistic application of the thesis of his book would likely be counterproductive. He fears that if we give in to those economists such as Hayek, Malthus, Smith, and Friedman who say self-interest (rather than reciprocity) is good, we may inadvertently promote greed. “In other words, the reason we must not say that people are nasty is because it is true.” (p. 260) "

24,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31386292-grace-cao,5,"Great book on why and how humans cooperate. Most evidence are from biology, anthropology and history.Bee hives are a harmony not because monarchy but voluntary cooperation made by peers. Selfishness is almost the definition of vice. In contrast, virtue is, almost by definition, the greater good of the group.The thing about human beings that needs explaining is not their frequent vice, but their occasional virtue.It is specialization that makes human society greater than the sum of its parts.Emotions mediate between our inner calculator and outer behavior. Emotions elicit reciprocity in the long run. Our emotions are guarantees of our social commitment. Morality serves to police fairness in reciprocal exchanges. The virtuous are virtuous for no other reason than that it enables them to join forces with others whose are virtuous, to mutual benefit. And once cooperators segregate themselves off from the rest of society a wholly new force of evolution can come into play: one that pits groups against each other, rather than individuals. Weapons make dominance a chancy business, and thus require a leader to lead more by persuasion than by coercion. We are an extremely groupish species, but not a group-select one. We are designed not to sacrifice ourselves for the group but to exploit the group for ourselves. Humankind has always fragmented into hostile and competitive tribes, and those that found a way of drumming (ritual) cultural conformity into the skulls of their members tended to do better than those that did not. It is a rule of evolution to which we are far from immune that the more cooperative societies are, the more violent the battles between them. Hitler perfected the double standard of in-group morality and out-group ferocity; socialism stood for communitarianism within the tribe, nationalism for its vicious exterior; given that humankind has an instinct towards tribalism that millions of years of groupishness have fostered, religions have thrived to the extent that they stressed the community of the converted and the evil of the heathen. Just as chimpanzee and dolphin individuals succeed by building alliances between individuals, so human groups succeed by building alliances between groups. The glue of such alliance is trade. Trade is the precursor of politics. Government, law, justice and politics are not only far more recently developed than trade, but they follow where trade leads. Markets, exchanges and rules can develop before government or any other monopolist has defined their rules. They define their own rules, because they have been part of human nature for many millions of years. If trade has been going on for hundreds of thousands of years, the reason lies in David Ricardo’s comparative advantage. Give a man the secure possession of bleak rock, and he will turn it into a garden; give him nine years lease of a garden, and he will turn it into a desert... the magic of property turns sand into gold.Our minds have been built by selfish genes, but they have been built to be social, trustworthy and cooperative. We owe our success as a species to our social instincts; they have enabled us to reap undreamed benefits from the division of labor. There proved to be a residue of human quality beyond cultural control. Karl Marx designed a social system that would only have worked if we were angels; it failed because we were beasts. Given their immunity from criticism, Communist officials have consistently proved more corruptible and more nepotistic than democratic ones. Government does not impose virtue on inherently evil people, but corrupts the original virtue of the market place. We are not so nasty that we need to be tamed by intrusive government, nor so nice that too much government does not bring out the worst in us. "
25,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28151210-oleg-kitov,4,"This book is about a well-established argument in evolutionary psychology that individual self-interest is the source for intra- and inter-group cooperation and reciprocal altruism among non-kin. As a consequence it is subject to the commonly cited drawbacks of evolutionary psychology in general (e.g. ""if the evolutionary story fits the observed behaviour, it's gotta be right...""). Read this book together with Robert Wright's ""The Moral Animal"", Yuval Harrari's ""Sapiens"", Robert Sapolski's ""Behave"", Steven Pinker's ""The Blank Slate"". The book is logically consistent and uses many interesting examples. To prove his point about cooperation, Ridley considers anthropological evidence and invariably connects it to the (evolutionary prescribed) human instinct for self interest. He claims that the self interest is a sufficient condition to establish a social equilibrium, any external coordination is not needed (a-la laisser faire). In the final chapters of the book he uses this claim to give credence to (his?) libertarian views on economics and politics - ""small government all the way"" [this is my interpretation, not a quote]. Unfortunately, the 250 pages can barely scratch the surface of the ""origin of cooperation"". For this reason, the implications for optimal social organization that Ridley suggests are based on simplistic, metaphorical and reductionist arguments...having finished the book I now have much greater appreciation for Steven Pinker's tendency to produce 700-page-long books!The general flow of the argument goes as follows. Selfish genes can increase reproductive success and create ""non-zero-summness"" through cooperation. Stable cooperation is ensured trough labor division, with no need for benevolence, concern for the greater good or coordination. Reciprocal altruism in repeated interactions among individuals is the source of stable cooperation between non-kin. Intertemporal cooperation requires commitment and ability to develop / police reputations. Seemingly selfless behavior (reciprocal altruism) builds up reputation and hence trust, this increases the chances of reciprocal cooperative behavior in the long run. This ""reciprocity instinct"" gives rise to social constructs that promote cooperation. Cooperating reciprocators seek out each other in ""repeated games"" and form groups that increase ""non-zero-summness"" of the games. Thus, tribalism and group formation is driven by selfish interests and risk spreading: group selection is a mediator of self-interest and individual selection. Groups that manage to develop strong cooperation among members prevaile over other groups. [.....] We need to increase cooperation to promote non-zero-summness and stimulate human progress. Then Ridley starts talking about his views on how to do that...He concludes that ""trust is the foundation of virtue; [...] exchange between equals [...] between enfranchised and empowered individuals is the best recipe for cooperation"". Broadly speaking he argues that cooperation and hence non-zero-summness can be achieved by self-interested parties under well defined property rights - they will self organize into well-behaved and self-policing systems from initially chaotic behavior. Central planning can only disturb coordination. Unfortunately, he does not mention that this is only true for an idealized system with many small players of equal size on a network with uniformly distributed connectivity (each node has equal resources and influence over everyone else). The examples he uses implicitly assume this equality among individuals, which of course is not observed - individuals are wildly unequal among multiple socioeconomic dimensions. Hence, his argument against government involvement falls apart unless he can also prove that government stimulates inequality [he does not], thereby inhibiting the necessary condition for more cooperation that he himself lays out. Perhaps this is a topic for another book, but I think a discussion on how to promote the creation of ""enfranchised and empowered individuals"" would not hurt...granted he does reference Hobbes, Rousseau, Hume, Locke, Smith, Malthus, Darwin, Marx and Lenin, who have all thought about these issues."
26,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,5," After being enthralled by ‘Genome’ written by the same author, I eagerly picked up this book, whose description seemed equally promising. Written on a completely different subject, this books is about human nature; in particular, the social side of it. The book however starts with the gene- or to be precise, the selfish gene concept. Many animals do live in large groups, showing division of labour and hierarchy comparable to human societies. However, their cooperation may be driven by the selfishness of individuals to preserve and promote their own genes. But then are human societies any different? May be and may be not. In his charming and witty style of writing, Ridley manages to encompass evidence from divverse fields like economics, philosophy, anthropology and evolutionary biology to argue that contrary to popular belief, humans are still driven by instinct to a large extent. These instincts drive us to cooperate, drive morality, form societies and make us be nice to each other in general. But these instincts also have a darker side. They lead to groupishness, which manifests itself in the form of racism and eugenics. A recurring theme in the book is that we perform a lot of seemingly altruistic acts with the expectation of a similar favour in return. In many cases the returning favour may not be the immediate or of similar nature, but the hope is there nevertheless. The book is full of interesting insights which are explained and justified using ample of examples from animal world and human societies. There are some that I found particularly illuminating. For example, in one of the early chapters, Ridley discusses why we require emotions and moral sentiments. It seems that they do help in decisions making and that without them we would end up being rational fools, incapable of making any choice. In the case of sharing, he mentions that gift giving can actually be a form of competition by showing examples of certain North American Indian tribes. Another curious point put forward is that we are not conservationists by nature. The rosy picture of tribal groups being one with nature and respecting it is largely an illusion. Interestingly, conservation is most effective in privately owned areas rather than government owned areas. In all, I found the book to be both entertaining and enlightening. Both the style of writing and the contents are equally fascinating. Although, I do not agree to all that the writer concludes, there still many remarkable revelations that do make the book worth reading. I would highly recommend anyone wanting to have a deeper understanding of human social structure."
27,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38014864-charles,3,"Exploring the idea of altruism as evolutionarily advantageous. The author is very brief and I wouldn't consider this a very ""scientific"" book in the sense of him actually applying the scientific method to his researching and compilation of the book (there are only a few examples stated to support a bold and sweeping claim about humanity - that kind of thing). It is an enjoyable read about this person's particular opinion and viewpoint. He is an intelligent and thoughtful person, so it is interesting to read. I would not recommend this book for someone looking to learn something they are unacquainted with. Rather, it is a perspective on a topic, but it's educational value is lessened by how much of the author's own assumptions and stereotypes and projected onto the concepts, without much evidence or good reasoning. A broad range of subjects are considered and organised in a way that is conducive to good reading; your mind can ask its own questions and form its own arguments in a logical sequence as you read and that is satisfying."
28,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626792-rowan-sully-sully,3,"Thought this would be a philosophical book but turned out to be more anthropological. Draws a lot on Dawkins' selfish gene theory at first but analyses it differently. Whilst the genes appear selfish, is doesn't mean that we are only trying to protect our genes, but also are relatives, connections, and society as a whole.Gets a bit more interesting when Ridley talks about government. He comes to the conclusion that both Hobbes and Rousseau are wrong. That humans are not naturally good or bad. But that a lot of our inefficiencies and faults could be cured by removing the state. Because even though we are not naturally good or bad, we are cooperative. Because we naturally form connections and trade networks before far reaching governments. It's an argument for anarchism, but not in the way you'd typically see. It's anarchism without a wasteful and bureaucratic state. Social order is in our heads, it does not need to be enforced by a state. On our own, we naturally build exchange networks and forms of society. And these smaller societies are built on trust, the origin of virtue.Flaws: whilst this would probably work well for small societies, what would happen to larger societies. Nations would crumble (they are unnecessary anyway) but would diversity also crumble? Would racism and tribe wars rise? Or could the connective power of the internet allow us to keep us innovating and connected to a incredible range of people of differing opinions and cultures?"

Aristotle established that man is a social animal that is (at least potentially) capable of reason twenty six centuries ago. Then this dope comes along and tries to say it all again in 300 pages with multiple easily-avoidable distortions and misinterpretations of the tradition he is writing in. Ridley screws up Aristotle by acting as if ALL social behavior can be reduced to mere biology, as if even reason itself is able to be biologically reduced to a mere instinct! That nonsense like this is successfully published, based on errors corrected 26 centuries ago, is a testament to our intellectual poverty."

The only doubt I have is where, toward the end, Ridley discusses how government is generally far less effective at encouraging cooperation compared to allowing individuals or groups to ensure cooperation and fairness. This is a fair statement until you consider corporations, which are quite different to humans and groups of humans - once you have corporations I suspect government must intervene as corporations generally have no sense of fairness, trust, or any other virtue."

[pg. 44]The virtuous are virtuous for no other reason than that it enables them to join forces with others who are virtuous, to mutual benefit. And once cooperators segregate themselves off from the rest of society a wholly new force of evolution can come into play: one that pits groups against each other, rather than individuals. [pg. 147]To a large extent, human society is not a society of individuals, as the society of Leopard, or even lions, is- albeit the individual lions are lumped together in groups. Human society is composed of groups, superorganisms. The cohesiveness of groups that conformity achieve this is a valuable weapon in a world where groups must act together to compete with other groups. The decision that may be arbitrary is less important and that is a unanimous. [pg. 186]Human beings have social instincts. They come into the world equipped with predispositions to learn how to cooperate, to discriminate the trustworthy from the treacherous, to commit themselves to be trustworthy, to earn good reputations, to exchange goods and information, and to divide to labor. In this we are on our own. No other species has been so far down this evolutionary path before us, for no species has built a truly integrated society except among the inbred relatives of a large family such as an ant colony. We owe our success as a species to our social instincts; they have enabled us to reap undreamt benefits from the division of labor for our masters-the genes. They are responsible for the rapid expansion of our brains in the past 2 million years and thence for our inventiveness. Our societies and our minds evolved together, each reinforcing trends in the other. [pg. 249]"

But since evolutionary psychology has become one of my favorite subjects, it was worth another read anyway. There is a lot of excellent material here, from the origination of the crucial concept of reciprocal altruism through genetics and animal behavior, all the way up to the importance of private property rights to a functional society. All of the lower level material is based on solid principles of evolutionary biology, and Ridley does an excellent job explaining things from this point of view. The discussion of the higher level ideas such as groupishness and cooperation among coalitions build on those biological foundations, and again, these are presented with writing that's entertaining, clear, and logical.Coincidentally during this re-read, I became aware of a recent piece by Ridley in which he expresses the opinion that the now generally accepted climate change data and predictions are overly pessimistic. This is clearly a minority opinion among scientists and science writers, and while that doesn't necessarily make it wrong, I am more convinced by the majority opinion in this case. So maybe it was with this on my mind that I read the closing chapters in which Ridley builds an argument against ""big government"" and takes a couple of shots against the ""modern environmental movement"" based on the science that he's laid out previously. While it wouldn't be fair to simply dismiss his points, to me, this might be a step too far.In any case I'm glad to have revisited this book; much of it is a top notch discussion of fascinating subject matter."
55,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,3,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It explained game theory very well and discussed in detail the computer run experiments that concluded that the nicer versions of game theory (generous, pavlov, tit-for-tat, firm-but-fair) tended to be more successful than the nastier ones like prisoner's dilemma and that prisoner's dilemma could be quite cooperative if the players all knew each other and could trust that there would be no defections.I also liked how he launches from the concept of the selfish gene Dawkins so well illuminates in his book The Selfish Gene to show that humans act selfishly from the genes on up and when they act for the welfare of the group they are often either related (also shown in social insects like ants & bees) or really protecting themselves (the survival of the group means the survival of the individual).I also appreciated the discussion of the human tendency toward groupishness and conformity.However, at the very end of the book, it seems Ridley couldn't hold in his own personal political opinions about ""big government"" and the desire to get rid of government (which he thinks is too authoritarian) & relegate it to only defence to leave local groups to get on with the rest themselves. He is very much against the Leviathan. I might have given his ideas more of a chance if he had shown statistical proof that such a model works. Instead, he backs it up only with a notion of success being in the ability to trust one another and become invested in outcomes. I agree with this part, but I don't think he argued well enough that this necessarily translates into a great reduction in the reach and protection of the Leviathan."
56,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037566-joaquin,4,"I enjoyed the way this book ties together a huge amount of other authors and condenses all of the findings together. Ridley is very clear in explaining game theory, probably better than in any of the other books I've read before. He also mixes a lot of philosophy into his theory, but tries to back it up with direct observations.Now the only problem I found is that Ridley is a very persuasive writer, and he does get extremely political, and when doing so he picks and chooses very carefully which examples to show and which not to. It's a bit ironic how this book deals a lot with human propensities to deny imminent threats, and how we decide to rationalize this as individuals and as a species, while Ridley is well known for his controversial stance as a climate change denialist. This is where I believe the book is a bit tricky, even though he doesn't cover climate change as a subject, a lot of his political views seem to be mightily well founded, while we should be careful to know he can be as biased as any other human."
57,0140264450,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2782635-peter-jana,4,"Ridley uses evolutionary biology and anthropology to argue that human nature is cooperative for selfish reasons. He draws a political conclusion from this, arguing that since human beings interact with a modicum of restraint they don’t need big government (Leviathan) to do it. In fact, government paternalism makes people more selfish and greedy. Ridley promotes the conservative claim that “free individuals in small communities” are all that is needed for justice, social order, and economic prosperity. Perhaps this would be true in an ideal world, but we do not live in one. We live in a world where corporations have become the new Levithans. Ridley does not consider the corrupting influence of power and how vast inequalities of power and wealth usurp democracy. Although I don’t agree with Ridley’s conclusions, the journey that takes us there is a fascinating synopsis of contemporary ideas in evolutionary biology and anthropology. Don’t let the political slant expressed in the final chapters keep you from reading this book. "

The bulk of the book is an largely interesting, sometimes fascinating (sometimes less so) investigation into the genetic origins of 'niceness'. The last third takes a jarring right turn into polemic territory, and can be summarised as 'private ownership good, public (state) ownership bad'. Nothing will deter Ridley from this position, which he illustrates with examples largely centred on common ownership (as opposed to the reality of ownership being concentrated in the hands of a small number of individuals.) How convincing you find this will probably depend on your political leanings. Personally, I could see what he was getting at, but wasn't convinced by the incomplete argument put forward. Overall this was an interesting read, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd been conned into reading a political diatribe dressed up as a book about genetics and human nature."

Much of the book makes sense, but the final conclusion (we are social creatures that thrive best in situations with limited central government) and some elements leading up to the it are to me dubious. The uncritical acceptance of Pleistocene overkill scenarios (which I would say from my own work are at most a partial explanation) leads in to a discussion on how non-moveable resources are generally efficiently managed by grassroots cooperatives. Government interference is said to be disastrous to such cooperatives. It is this government interference that is then proposed to be responsible for among other things all situations of ecological decline in the developing world. Although the analysis has appealing elements, I fear that the modern globalised situation a grassroots solution will not always work."
