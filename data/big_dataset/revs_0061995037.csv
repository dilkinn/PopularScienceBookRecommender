0,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,3,"I had a sufficiently positive impression of Dan Ariely from his first book, Predictably Irrational, to be willing to give this one a try. My residual impression from the earlier book was of a smart, likable guy, with a knack for designing clever experiments to capture the irrational side of human behavior, particularly when making decisions with economic consequences. This area of investigation has risen to prominence over the past 5 to 10 years, there is now a flood of titles on the market, which shows no sign of abating in the foreseeable future. Predictably Irrational holds up well against the competition: it covers a lot of ground in reasonably concise fashion, and is quite readable. Each chapter's primary message is grounded in, and illustrated by, specific experiments conducted by Ariely and colleagues, and this is the book's particular strength. Given the strength of Ariely's first book, and the relatively short interval since its publication, it would be truly surprising if this second book reached the same high standard. ""Sophomore slump"" is a real phenomenon (just a manifestation of what statisticians would call ""regression to the mean"") and Professor Ariely is not immune to its effects. A reviewer predisposed to be critical of the author might argue that this is a sequel that is short on substance, presenting results that are either (i) blindingly obvious (e.g. that people need to believe their work is meaningful to feel motivated), (ii) needless and not particularly illuminating amplification of ideas already presented in the first book (overvaluing of ownership and the power of anchoring),or,(iii)material presented previously, and better, by other authors.That assessment seems unduly harsh to me - the sequel shares some of the positive qualities of the original - primarily Ariely's clear and engaging style, which guarantees readability at the very least. Unfortunately, an engaging style doesn't quite make up for some of the book's obvious weaknesses. The material in the earlier book was fascinating because most of the results were surprising -- counterintuitive or non-obvious -- but the experimental work was strong enough to be persuasive. The experimental foundation of the work discussed in the second book is noticeably weaker across the board, at times barely rising about the level of anecdotal data, with the author displaying a regrettable propensity to issue pronouncements of a general nature solely on the basis of his own personal experience. Even if one disregards the relative weakness of the empirical evidence to support them, claims made in the second book are simply not as interesting as the earlier work - either they are immediately obvious, or restatements of material likely to be familiar to anyone who has done any prior reading in this general area. Finally, there is the unavoidable impression that a significant portion of the material is nothing more than padding (the book is studded with space-filling sidebars that are notably lacking in content: examples include a one-page explanation of the myth of Sisyphus, complete with stick-figure diagram, a verbatim transcript of an online rant about the 2008 banking bailout, graphs that were superfluous, cartoonish, or both). The most egregious padding is Ariely's inclusion of what seems like an endless stream of personal anecdotes from his own life, a feature that severely tests the reader's patience and is an implicit acknowledgement that this is a book based primarily on anecdotal evidence, rather than hard science.With these caveats in mind, I quite enjoyed the book. But I can't give it a resounding endorsement. Instead, I would steer readers to: Predictably Irrational ,  Stumbling on Happiness and  Nudge . Cumulatively they afford an accessible account of the same material that is more thorough and more rigorous than that in Professor Ariely's somewhat disappointing sophomore effort."
1,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/357223-poonam,4,"Since long I have wanted to add a gist of review of this book, chapter-wise so that I could look up later.Part 1 - Work-related Irrationalities1. Big Bonuses don't work. (Which means CEO high salaries aren't quite logical.) Oh, but this is no way a bad news for your rewards and recognition program. Bonuses and reward should be just right, not too less that people do not care and not too much that enormity of reward at stake scares your people into failure.2. Even though all of us work for a salary to make living. But we all like to find some meaning in the work. For example, if you are a writer who was paid well to research and complete the book, but if for some reason your book does not see light of the day, it is demotivating even if you were paid well for the job. Dan Ariely's team conducts experiments where they pay people to create Lego blocks. For the people, who saw their 'creation' being demolished right in front of them, they found it difficult to go on with work even though they were being paid. So, we all like to find meaning in our work.3. Ikea furniture works because we overvalue what we ourselves make. We kind of take pride in our creations even if it be a simple origami. Ikea works its not too complicated and yet it gives your bask in that pride that comes when you create your own thing.4. How sometimes we pass up great ideas because they weren't ours. We didn't think them. So many times, wise aegis is that make your bosses feel that the idea came from them.5. Why revenge gives us pleasure? Why we punish when we feel things have been unjust. Creative ways customer seek revenge, for example, a viral video about a hotel's bad service. How sometimes apologies can be powerful.Part 2 - Home-related irrationalities1. Human power of adaptation. Adaptation of pain. Or, adaption when your prized possessions no longer bring you happiness. How adaption can work for you.2. On Dating. Hot or Not site, interesting dating patterns. Perception of beauty.3. More on online dating sites. How market fails. 4. Empathy and emotion - strange phenomenon where we all set out in hordes to help pay for a single person but when it is a genocide or a tragedy involving hundreds and thousands, our capacity to charity sort of diminishes. The 'Drop-in-the-bucket-effect'.5. Long-term effect of short-term emotions such as anger, jealousy etc - how our decisions are impacted.6. Lessons from irrationalities - how we should test everything. In short, everything we do is not as logical as it may seem to us."
2,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"It is possible that I give far too many books five stars. Oh well.There is a lovely bit in Bright-sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined Americawhere Barbara is at a conference of those who would have us wear badges with smiley-faces stuck in our lapels were they discussed if 'Positive Thinking' might not be a brand that has a bit of a smell about it. Time to rebrand, perhaps? Re-branding is, after all, the solution to all of the worlds ills (why they haven't changed the name of the Iraq War by now is one of the world's great mysteries) This is when someone, in all seriousness, in the audience suggested renaming Positive Thinking something modern and snappy like Applied Behavioural Economics.Behavioural Economics has become very popular. The number of books on the subject has exploded and doesn’t really look like slowing down any. Some of these books, like SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes And Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance, might make you question the worth of continuing the brand, but not Mr Ariely's books – his blogs are a constant joy and this book, although quite different from his last book, Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, is also well worth reading.I’m gong to be brutally honest, this book is not nearly as good as his first one. The ratio of facts to the page has decreased and the ideas in this one aren’t nearly as blindingly interesting as some of the ideas in his first. For instance, I have frequently told people over the years about the masturbation Vs decision making experiment described in his first book. I have also told people about the idea of paying your mother-in-law for her Thanks Giving dinner. These are endlessly fascinating experiments that tell us fundamental truths about being humans. The experiments detailed in this book are a bit more obvious. Nevertheless, they do get the reader to think and getting to think is a good part of the reason why one reads in the first place.If I was feeling cruel I think I would say that Behavioural Economics is a series of fascinating ideas in search of an over-arching theory. Its basic problem is that it is a bit like Atheism – it is essentially oppositional. There is nothing wrong with that, per se, but being purely oppositional can become tedious.So, what does Behavioural Economics stand in opposition to? The simple answer is Rational Economics. Rational Economics is the view that people always act according to their best interests. When confronted with choices they always decide on the one that best meets their needs. Rational Economics confounds freedom with choice and ignores emotion entirely. Rational Economics also confounds motivation with incentives. But Rational Economics also provides the basis on which we build many of the theories that structure how we think about the economy as a whole – particularly around notions of the free market. The idealised ‘homo-economicus’, the rational individual who decides what is in their best interest and always acts according to the dictates of their reason, like Kantian clones, who lives at the foundation of Rational Economics simply does not exist. Books by Behavioural Economists tend to detail groups of experiments where people are forced to make decisions and how they invariably make decisions that are clearly not in their long term (or even immediate) interests and this is normally because people are notoriously bad at making decisions and are prone to all manner of predictable biases. This book is much more ‘personal’ than his previous one. Ariely has suffered horribly in life and he uses his experiences of unspeakable pain as a way to explain some of the ideas necessary in this book. This is highly effective and in line with what he has to say in chapter nine on why we are more likely to be affected by the misery of one person (little girl down a well) or people close to us (those killed in 9/11) than to the misery of lots of people we don't know (AIDS sufferers in Africa, for instance). There is a very disturbing table in this book outlining the amount of money directed at various human tragedies and the number of ‘victims’ of each of these – the table shows that something over $2,500,000,000 has been directed at people affected by 9/11 while maybe $200,000,000 has been directed at people suffering from AIDS. A comparison of the number of victims is very disturbing – with less than a tenth of the money going to AIDS sufferers and the victims of 9/11 being measured in the thousands there are an estimated 40 million people suffering from AIDS. More could have been done in this book to tie the ideas together and to match the title and show more of irrationality's 'upside'. For instance, there is an interesting discussion on the fact that higher bonuses do not lead to better performance. In fact, there is evidence that the opposite is the case and that bonuses beyond a certain point diminish performance by being ‘distracting’. Another part of the book shows that people need to feel their work is meaningful. Yet another shows that people tend not to donate money to causes if they are given lots of statistics about the enormity of the problem. But all three of these ideas are intimately linked together and it would have been a good thing if they had been tied together in a way that highlighted the links. That is, by paying CEOs obscene amounts of money we are directing the ‘meaning’ of their work away from what it ought to be, i.e. building better companies, and focusing it on their own personal greed. People need meaning in their lives and structuring their work so that it is meaningful is the best way to increase their performance, which is also why we tend not to give money to 'save the planet' causes as much as we give to find Snuggles, the lost puppy charities. We need to see results for there to be meaning and global warming, AIDS in Africa and the rest are just too huge and our efforts too tiny in comparison. Humans seek meaning - meaning is what matters and is the link that holds most of Behavioural Economics together. The problem is that sometimes how we make meaning of the world is either self-serving or flawed due to predictable biases we have. The task is to find new ways to make meanings that avoid these biases.This review is sounding like I didn’t like the book, but that is really not the case. I enjoyed this book very much and even though some of it is very confronting (the last chapter on how his doctors saved his arm and whether this was a good or bad thing is, to use an Americanism, in your face) I think the ideas contained in it are very important and I think he has successfully, and not gratuitously, used his life to illuminate his meaning.I am concerned that we will learn nothing from the Global Financial Crisis. Those who own our media and who run our companies are the same people who profit the most from our doing nothing to change the system. There was a real danger that the $700 billion that was poured into the banks to save Capitalism by the US taxpayers might have disappeared without so much as a gurgling sound. It frightens me that all attempts to increase regulation and to impose restrictions on speculation (such as a Robin Hood Tax http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYtNwm...) have been met with either silence or derision. At the start of this book Ariely mentions his talking to CEOs about the results of experiments he ran on the negative consequences of paying people huge bonuses, how large bonuses actually reduce performance – the CEOs essentially said that the results of his experiments simply did not apply to them and applied only to we lesser mortals. I think it is going to take more than a letter writing campaign explaining the negative effects of huge bonuses to those who benefit most from obscene bonuses to stop these bonuses being paid. If we want to stop them being paid, asking CEOs to make that decision off their own bat is probably the least likely way of achieving it. If only we lived in a democracy – then people would be able to vote and to decide on laws that could restrict such naked self-interest and appalling greed. But I’m sure the idea of democracy will never catch on. Which is obviously a pity, really.If Behavioural Economics is ever going to be more than just oppositional, I think it will need to more closely align itself to overtly democratic principles – Rational Economics has nailed its colours to the mast of Aristocracy or Plutocracy and believes in the maxim of increasingly unequal distribution of the goods of society as the prime motivator towards higher production. There are some hints that Behavioural Economics might provide some hope of showing the benefits of more egalitarian modes of distribution. I think if that is the case then Behavioural Economics may have more to offer than what it does today, a series of often disconnected even if fascinatingly interesting experiments.I still recommend you read this book."
3,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602881-paul,3,"Another good read from Dr. Ariely; however, I very much more enjoyed his first book (Predictably Irrational) over this one. Maybe I was in a more ""critical"" frame of mind when reading this, but a couple of the early chapters left me with some questions.In Chapter 2, he discusses the concept of “contrafreeloading” and uses the example of the rat who, at the sign of a light signal, leaves a “free” bowl of food in favor of the lever that he must push to produce food, as well as his pet parrot, Jean Paul, who spends hours with her SeekaTreat uncovering food, despite the presence of “free” food.One thing that I didn’t quite understand (although, of course, I’m most certain that he accounted for it somehow) is how he ruled out the possibility that perhaps the rat was simply trying to maximize its food supply by going after the time-restricted food, knowing that the “free” food wasn’t going anywhere, and that it would therefore have even more food for itself overall once the light goes off again. (Putting myself in the rat’s position, as he suggested in that narrative, led me to exactly that possible train of thought.)The same question can be posed in the case of Jean Paul—along with the question of how he was able to rule out the additional possibility that perhaps Jean Paul wasn’t primarily after the food (although it was I’m sure a nice side effect for him), but rather was mainly seeking the mental stimulation of the activity during the long boring hours alone.On another topic, in Chapter 3, he discusses the “Ikea Effect” and the additional value that we place on our own creations. He sets out in the beginning of the chapter to show, among other things, whether or not that value is based on sentimental attachment or on self-delusion. Using the first origami auction, he clearly shows that creators valued their creations more than the passersby, but admittedly, not what caused the disparity in the evaluations. To that effect, he then went on to the second origami auction, which showed that non-creators valued professional-looking origami at levels similar to creators valuing their own creations, and much higher than non-creators valuing those amateur creations. The conclusion he recounted from that experiment was that “creators had a substantial bias when evaluating their own work” and that “creators saw their own work as almost as good as the experts’ origami”. Again, it might just be my own lack of understanding, but why is that the logical conclusion—how do those results necessarily rule out sentimental attachment in favor of self-delusion? What was it in that result set that pointed him specifically to self-delusion? Also, after completing the chapter, I was still left perplexed as to where in the chapter (or in the experiments) sentimental attachment was specifically ruled out. Perhaps the inflated values were in fact a result of mere sentimental attachment and the creators were in fact aware of the inferiority of their creations nonetheless?In any case, it was still an enjoyable read, and I'd still recommend it (although, again, his first book seemed much better to me). Incidentally, I emailed him with these exact questions, so who knows—I might yet get those answers someday!"
4,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed Ariely's previous book Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, and this book is excellent as well. There are many ""pop-psychology"" books on the market these days, but one thing sets this book off from the rest. Rather than simply reporting on the research of others, the author himself conducted the many psychology experiments described in his book. This gives the book an aura of authenticity, because it describes research in the first person. The author clearly describes the motivations behind his experiments. Sometimes the experiments gave unanticipated results--and this was interesting, too! Ariely does not try to hide the results that contradict his hypotheses; instead, he uses these results as a stepping stone to additional experiments and research.Ariely covers a wide range of topics, and each topic is intensely interesting. He explores how small pay bonuses can motivate someone to do a job a little better--but large bonuses can fail to produce proportionately better results. Ariely shows how ironic it is, that scientific research into the efficacy of drugs is held in high regard, but research into the efficacy of business practices (like awarding bonuses) is disregarded simply because of the anti-intuitive findings. I found the chapter on revenge to be especially interesting; why do people find revenge so necessary when they feel slighted? And why does a simple apology for a small slight work so well at mitigating revenge? Ariely's clever experiments shed a lot of light on these issues.I did not give the book five stars, because I felt that the book devotes too much space to the author's traumas during his lengthy recovery from his injuries. Some additional editing would have been helpful."
5,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,3,"Loy Machedo's Book Review - The Upside of Irrationality by Dan ArielyThere have a couple of books on Behavioral Economics that I have read over the last 2 years. A few of my favorites being:1. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman,2. Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.) by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner,3. SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner4. The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg,5. Influence: Science and Practice by Robert B. Cialdini,6. How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer,7. The Undercover Economist by Tim Harford8. Buyology: Truth and Lies About Why We Buy by Martin Lindstrom and Paco Underhill9. Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping--Updated and Revised for the Internet, the Global Consumer, and Beyond by Paco Underhill10. Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein (didn't like this one though)But I have to admit, Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely was the 1st. And what's more, it was the 1st book review I had ever written. So yeah, it does bring back memories and this makes Dan's book an honor to be read and reviewed again.In this book, Dan Ariely, I feel, starts off where he left off previously. But what gives this book the magnetic charm is the personalized narrative of the authors life, the openness of his feelings, the horrible memories of his recovery period (having suffered 3rd degree burns), the silly humor and yes, the slight hint of sarcasm the author has towards his fellow bankers, economists and intellects.However, as opposed to Predictably Irrational it doesn't provide any new insights. As other reviewers have already mentioned, some of the experiments in this book are rather questionable. Just to cite one example, Ariely argues that high bonuses are not effective because when high stakes are involved people get nervous, and therefore, their performance drops. He ""proves"" that by offering three different winning prices (a small, medium and large bonuses) to random people to play various games. In this experiment, the performance of the player dropped as the amount of the bonuses was higher. Therefore, Ariely argues, big bonuses are not the best way to provide incentives to workers. (This only applies to cognitive tasks, and not to, for instance, laying brick, where the bigger the bonuses the harder people work). So can this hypothesis be sufficient to make a global theory?Ariely then peppers the second half of the book - which focuses on personal issues of irrationality - with stories of his experiences following a horrendous accident he suffered as a teenager.Here are brief summaries of the chapters.1. Paying more for less:Why big bonuses do not always work - the bonus structure that raises the performance of physical work often freezes out knowledge workers.2. The Meaning of Labor:What Legos can teach us about the joy of work - how work defines us and the value we place on that definition. There are deep reasons why everyone's baby is the most beautiful in the world.3. The IKEA effect:Why we overvalue what we make - the behavioral realities of `sunk effort' and how to make products and services more sticky by stealing from Betty Crocker.4. The Not-Invented-Hear bias:Why my ideas are better than yours - an examination of author bias and the behaviors behind executive, expert and management hubris in the workplace.5. The Case for Revenge:What makes us seek justice - it is more than a dish best served cold. In fact revenge is a very powerful force in business.6. On Adaptation:Why we get used to things, but not all things and not always - provides a fascinating study of the behavioral economics of change that helps you understand why traditional change management does not work.7. Hot or Not?Adaptation, assertive mating and the beauty market - if you always thought it was a jungle out there, you were right and this chapter talks about the realities of how you seek and form lasting social relationships.8. When a market fails:An example from online dating - a fascinating look at how the most sophisticated technology and psychographics cannot resolve a fundamentally flawed market structure.9. One Empathy and Emotion:Why we respond to one person who needs help, but not to many - explains the rational and reality behind how to mobilize people and their resources and why the American Cancer Society is so effective.10. Long Term and Short Term Emotions:Why we shouldn't act on our negative feelings - the reasons and science behind why it really is best to sleep on it.11. Lessons form our Irrationalities:Why we need to test everything - provides a framework and way of thinking to get your rationality back.Why you may love this book:1. The book has kept the structure and formula that made Predictably Irrational successful. If you liked that book, then you will like this one.2. The book is backed by real research and the author is not afraid to show you how they tested these ideas, the results and their assumed implications.3. The writing style is personal and candid. Many a times you will feel as if Ariely is explaining the ideas of this book to you over a conversation without it getting stale or too academic.Why you may not like this book:1. The book can drag in places - as you will go through the same structure for chapter after chapter.2. The experiments, while interesting, involve college students (MIT and Harvard mostly) working for relatively trivial sums of money. This raises an issue of applicability in a bigger business setting.3. Once you read a few books in this genre of Behavioral Economics and the come back to Predictably Irrational, you will find most of the research repetitiveHonorable MentionI loved the chapter on his Audi experience (loved the revenge strategy he adopted), the chapter on online dating, and most importantly, the honesty that poured out each page. It made me feel as if I was with him at a bar exchanging interesting bits of information.Moment of TruthThe book is very easy to read. It is written in a conversational style. I feel Dan has the rare gift to take a complex subject and present it in easy to understand concepts - effective in terms of understanding and retention. My only bone of contention being it got a little boring at times and yes most of the experiments were kind of long drawn.Overall Ratings6.5 out of 10Loy Machedoloymachedo.com"
6,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85146-jill,5,"Ariely writes about behavioral economics: ""We don't assume that people are perfectly sensible, calculating machines. Instead, we observe how people actually behave, and quite often our observations lead us to the conclusion that human beings are irrational.""No one ever admits to being irrational, yet we frequently witness irrational behavior in others. After reading the book, I'll have to begrudgingly admit that I'm not perfectly rational either !Throughout the 11 chapters of the book, various premises are tested by designing some easy to measure field tests which challenge our assumptions about behavior. The book is segregated into two sections - the first on ""Ways we Defy Logic at Work"" (Chapters 1 through 5) and ""Ways We Defy Logic at Home"" (Chapters 6 through 10).In Chapter 1, Ariely discusses the banking meltdown of 2008 and posits that huge bonuses don't work to incent better performance. There is plenty of actual and anecdotal evidence to support this idea. In Chapter 2, he discusses various situations and experiments that demonstrate how important it is to each of us to imbue meaning in our work and to have meaningful work. There is a deep interconnection between identity and labor. Chapter 3, ""The Ikea Effect"" describes why we are so much more attached to things that we helped to produce, rather than things we did not have a hand in - ""labor begets love"". The NIH (not invented here) syndrome is discussed in Chapter 4. The NIH factor is called the ""toothbrush theory"" - everyone wants one, everyone needs one, everyone has one, but no one wants to use anyone else's. Chapter 5 discusses the irrational behavior of revenge which is one of the deepest-seated instincts we have. Ariely wrote: ""The threat of revenge can serve as an effective enforcement mechanism that supports social cooperation and order.""In Part II (defying logic at home), there are some very interesting chapters on adaptation - how we get used to things and rationalize both bad and good situations. The chapters on dating and online dating are quite fascinating. Chapters 9 and 10 cover empathy and emotion and why we are more motivated to donate to a single suffering individual than to a larger cause by which thousands or millions of people are affected.The final chapter summarizes and encourages us to recognize the upside of irrationality: ""some of the ways in which we are irrational are also what makes us wonderfully human.""""The Upside of Irrationality"" is a very thought-provoking book written by a believable and articulate professional. Ariely has a very personal style, incorporating many incidents from his own life and his struggles with debilitating burn injuries in his youth that altered the course of his life and certainly affected his point of view. I highlighted many passages in my Kindle and suspect that I will be picking up this book again from time to time to reread the highlights. "
7,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6729622-lester,3,"I have read the three books by Dan Ariely, Preidctably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty. After reading all the three books, I have this feeling that the examples used, the experiments mentioned and some of the themes are starting to repeat in different places. Maybe there is a limit to what an author can write or give in terms of contents. After all we are all humans.I give a four star rating for Predictably Irrational and the Honest Truth About Dishonesty. For the Upside of Irrationality, I only give it a three star because (1) the description on the various experiments is less (2) there are rather a lot of personal experiences together with stories supporting the author's viewpoint, rendering it less scientific (3)the themes and conclusions look a bit obvious and rather thin.looking at some of the reviews inside Amazon, I have found that some people questioned about the validity or robustness of the experiments. Some may have different interpretations on the results of the experiments. Nevertheless I still found most of the themes echoing with my experience.The field of behavioural science and behavoural economics has flourished in these days. People like Steven Levitt, dan Ariely, Richard Wiseman, Barry Schwartz have taken their turns in writing books in these areas. Peronally I enjoy reading all these not only because they are easily accessible and readable to a layman like me, but by reading them we can all learn and reflect on our own behaviour."
8,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178033-cat,1,"I did NOT like this book. This is one of a long line of behavioral-economic-statistics books a la Tipping Point and Blink, but is not well written and comes late in the game. At times (many times) Dan Ariely uses ""research"" consisting of a handful of young people, collected from the not-so-diverse environment of his local Starbucks. He asks them to complete 5 min tasks and then makes widespread generalizations about human behavior. It seems as though the author is trying to cash in on American's trend of eating up books on this subject. Fail."
9,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/919342-miguel,4,"This is definitely not ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" nor does it pretend to be. The main attraction of Ariely's books is Ariely himself. He is sort of a cuddly pop Montaigne who writes his persona constantly into the text. The author-persona --a self-deprecating, humorous Israeli-American academic who suffered a terrible accident in his youth-- weaves himself into the the different chapters about topics as diverse as the effectiveness of large bonuses to achieve better performance, revenge as a motivator in client-company interactions or our irrational affection toward objects we assemble ourselves.I am a layman who is a fan of behavioral economics, so Ariely is preaching to the converted and I am therefore inclined to give a positive rating, although sometimes the fluffiness of a book that can be read in under five or six hours makes you long for such a brilliant author to wade into slightly more controversial territory or for his ""author-character"" to become a little more provocative. For example, the chapter on bonuses proves conclusively that higher stakes in many contexts can produce markedly worse performances. Fine. Point taken. But it is massively disingenuous to say that perhaps investment banks can avoid mega-catastrophes such as the 2008 meltdown by parceling out bonuses over a number of years or simply tucking them inside base compensation. The people who packaged, sold and bought mortgages as CDOs did not screw up because of anxiety induced by large bonuses. Many did so either cynically knowing these monstrosities would eventually blow up or simply not caring as long as fees rolled in. And Ariely knows it, but both his style and his content peddle ""behavior-ec"" as an ingenious quick-fix for human frailty when some of the issues he discusses actually deal with much thornier issues. In the bonus case, the real issue is whether the search for short-term gain by a handful of individuals in some organizations can lead to long-term damage to society at large. This in turn requires the discussion of big, non-fluffy issues such as the effects of government regulation that cannot be resolved in nifty 15-page chapters. And this is the sort of ""heavy"" stuff you will definitely not find in this type of book. "
10,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,4,"We are irrational and this book goes over many of our irrationalities. Not only that, the book shows how they can be beneficial (hence the title). For example, it shows how revenge might be a waste of resources and we still take it on others (and revenge can be useful for our societies, too).For example, the book shows how motivation works. Incentives can increase our performance: we will do better in a test if the prize is bigger. Yet, as we increase the incentive, our performance might start to decline and be worse with higher incentives.Another example: we are more motivated if we know our efforts do not go to waste, even if the activity is futile itself. What makes this book interesting, is the numerous simple and smart experiments that are described in a story telling manner and in detail.This book was an easy and entertaining read. If you are curious about every day choices of people, how we make decisions and what factors influence our choices (even though sometimes irrational), I would recommend reading it."
11,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833260-julie,4,"Dan Ariely is one of my favorite non-fiction writers, so I was excited to find out that he'd come out with a new book, The Upside of Irrationality, and frustrated that I had to wait so long for it to be available at my library. But it finally came in, and I tore through it in two or three days.Following on the heels of Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality charts ways in which we humans are not the rational, careful beings economists tell us we are. Ariely's goal is twofold: first, to get us to recognize our irrationalities and how they affect our lives, and second, to show us how we can use these irrationalities to help us once we've recognized them.The first half of the book relates roughly to irrationalities in the work world. The first chapter, ""Paying More for Less: Why Big Bonuses Don't Always Work"" explains that, contrary to our intuitions and all CEO bonus plans, bigger bonuses don't improve performance for anything other than simple mechanical tasks. It's a topic that's been covered at length by Dan Pink in his book Drive. Other topics I was less familiar with: chapters three and four describe how we value (or even overvalue) objects and ideas when we've made them ourselves. That's why you're so attached to your amateurish IKEA bookshelf or shaky watercolor, or why you're much more likely to endorse an idea when you've thought of it yourself. (Or when you think you've thought of it yourself, as salespeople have known for ages.) In this first section, Ariely also tackles revenge (companies could save a lot of money if they really understood the value of a sincere apology) and meaningful work (even well-compensated people will get depressed if you ignore their work or make it appear useless).The second half is on relationships, both romantic and otherwise. Ariely first discusses a counter-intuitive finding (which I discovered through Dan Gilbert's Stumbling On Happiness) that people adapt much more effectively to circumstances than they'd expect. Both paraplegics and lottery winners tend to revert to a baseline happiness after a while. So if you want to be happy, space out or interrupt your happy experiences (don't outfit your new apartment all at once, but buy one thing at a time after the thrill of the last one has faded) and plow through your bad experiences all at once (don't take breaks when you're paying taxes, cut your extra budget items all at once).Also in the second half, Ariely discusses the dating market. He explains why attractive people tend to date other attractive people, but less attractive people tend to value other qualities, like ""sense of humor."" He also shows how online dating doesn't at all account for human limitations or tendencies. As an experiment: get your friends and acquaintances to describe themselves in the check-box-like manner of dating sites and see if you can figure out, just based on those criteria, which ones you like and which ones you don't. People tend to connect best when they're sharing experiences rather than just talking about themselves.Ariely also describes how we're much more likely to respond to the concrete need of one person, especially someone close to us, than the abstract need of many. (Compare how much money you'd give to a neighbor with cancer who lost his job compared to millions of kids with malaria in Africa.) He also discusses how our emotions affect our decisions, and how these decisions can impact us long after the emotion has faded away. (Imagine you're in a good mood and bring flowers to your mother-in-law's. The next time you visit, you may bring flowers again, because you've set the precedent. Sadly, this also works for decisions made under the impact of negative emotions.)All told, I loved this book, as I expected I would. Ariely's a great writer, and I love reading about behavioral economics and human irrationalities. A great read."
12,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3122452-nancy,5,"My take: Dan Ariely has the coolest job EVER. Best as I can tell, he's a social psychologist. He studies social behavior and creates questionnaires to determine why a person does what s/he does. So he teaches his classes at Duke University, probably wearing his tweed jacket with patches on the elbows, has an idea, presents it to whoever pays for it, writes his hypotheses, makes up a questionnaire, then lures unsuspecting citizens into his lair for experimentation.I absolutely loved how he used every day toys to test his theories on the value of work. Using Legos, he has his candidates build a toy with the understanding the toys will be dismantled. One group watched the toys being dismantled then used the same pieces for the same project. The other group watched the assembled project placed out of eyesight while they continued their building. One group (guess which one) gave up much sooner than the other.The first half of the book covers the world of work. The second half covers the workings of assortative mating, adaptation, online ""dating"" and determines success rate, and the overall use of questioning our ""gut"" reactions and feelings. This also clarified why I chose my husband rather than another person I was dating. Assortative mating is a skill we use to whittle down prospective mates. So interesting!Reading this book was kind of like sitting in a social psychology class, drinking in all of the information without having to show up for class. The author includes his own dose of humor and is brave enough to disclose how some of his discoveries put his own injuries into perspective. Ariely was badly burned as a teenager and spent 3 years hospitalized and in intense therapy. He believes this is the reason he chose the scholarly route.I love social psychology. In another life, I'd love to BE a social psychologist. I just don't want to do a dissertation."
13,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,5,"Dan Ariely's previous book on behavioral economics, Predictably Irrational was fantastic. It explored the way that economics work on a personal level when you stop assuming that people are completely irrational and provided a great overview of the many kinks in the human brain that lead us to make weird, suboptimal decisions. His new book, The Upside of Irrationality, flips that coin onto its other side and looks at hour our penchant for irrational decision-making can actually benefit us and make us better off. Or how it could if we let it.Like in his last book, Ariely draws from a deep well of research conducted by himself and his colleagues in order to provide context for everything he discusses. What I love about this aspect of the book is how clever off-the-wall many of the experiments are. Ariely and company send researchers to villages in India to measure the surprising effect of extravagant rewards on task performance. They construct fake and experimental online dating sites to see how we might better construct our online interactions to capitalize on what it really is that people --especially those of us south of ""supermodel"" in the looks department-- look for in a mate. They talk about subjecting lucky subjects to massages and unlucky ones to excessive vacuum cleaner noise in order to see how we adapt to pleasure or pain. And a lot more. Every chapter contains descriptions of scientific research, but it's almost all really interesting and takes you to conclusions that will stick with you.So while I still think Predictably Irrational is the better of the two books because it's more interesting and instructuve to see how people fail than to see how they might succeed, The Upside of Irrationality is still a very quick and very interesting read. What's better, it's practical and may change how you think about your own behavior. "
14,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11142507-elaine,3,"A quick read, The Upside of Irrationality isn't too substantial if you've already read Predictably Irrational. Many examples are recycled and I felt unsure if this was the same book I had already read. It's still enjoyable in that behavioral economics style of feeling that you've learned something without diving into an overly dense book, and Ariely does have a lot of intelligent commentary. If this wasn't one of the only unread works downloaded onto my iBooks and I wasn't stuck on a 9 hour flight, I probably wouldn't have set aside time for this book."
15,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12903412-abdelmjid-seghir,5,"Ariely has a knack for making me reevaluate how I act and consider things. After Predictably Irrational left me in awe, The Upside of Irrationality comes to confirm that Ariely is a top-notch social scientist and is worthy of being revered as such. "
16,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024216-samridhi-khurana,4,"Dan Ariely’s books are always a delight to read. In the Upside of Irrationality, Ariely talks about the situations wherein no matter how rational we think of ourselves, we are always acting based on our pre conceived biases and notions. He also highlights how such acts sometimes fall into the right place in the long run. Being emotionally driven is not a very bad thing after all! Like the rest of his books, I’ll rate it as a must recommended read."
17,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15681284-greg,4,"A continuation of his previous book, except this time the focus is on how being irrational can be a good thing. Book consists of a number of examples, each illustrated by social psych experiments.- performance vs compensation is a U-shaped curve. The optimal compensation is somewhere in the middle. Once you exceed that level of compensation, performance starts to go down. Hypothesized explanation is that people can’t effectively concentrate because they’re so worried about the money- NBA clutch players are not really any more effective at shooting at those times; they just take more shots because other people believe they are more effective- Lego experiment and paper experiment show that if a worker senses his work is futile or without purpose, performance goes down. Subjects were compensated to build lego characters, getting less money for each subsequent character. Even though they enjoyed playing with legos, subjects in the condition where legos were immediately taken apart after completion (in plain sight) performed 50% less than subjects who waited until the end of the experiment to take apart the characters. Similarly, people in a word-counting exercise performed much lower when either they did not put their name on their work, or when their work was immediately shredded (optimum performance was when their name was on the work, and filed away). Interestingly, there was little difference between not putting name on work and shredding.- Having to do some work results in a much higher perceived value. For example, people are prouder of IKEA furniture when they have to assemble it. Similarly, instant cake mixes did not succeed until manufacturers added the “required” step of adding an egg.- Not Invented Here bias is real - even when two “theories” were essentially the same, but with the words mixed in different order, people preferred “their” theory- Revenge bias - people (and animals) have strong tendency for fairness. Would rather punish someone at their own expense than let someone get away with something unfair.- We get used to how nice things are - new car no longer exciting, so we seek something new to replace that feeling. Study showed that happiness in UK was correlated to increases in salary, not absolute salary level- People of differing attractiveness levels adapt by altering their criteria. Perceived beauty is universal though - less attractive people tend to realize when someone else is out of their league. This is less true for males than females though- One death is a tragedy, one million deaths are a statistic. (Stalin). If I see the suffering of the masses, I will not act. When I look at the suffering of one, I am compelled to act (Mother Theresa). Urge to act to others is based on three criteria - closeness (physical proximity), vividness, and drop-in-the-bucket effect (will acting actually make a difference, or is it insignificant)."
18,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13733795-stefanos,4,"Dan Ariely,a great teacher,writer and,above all,a leading figure in the fields of social science and behavioral economics,proves once again to be da man(!) and Upside of irrationality to be a decent follow-up of Predictably Irrational.The main target of the book is,of course,debunking rational-choice-models of standard economics which assumes that human beings always understand their needs and wants.That we are calculating machines,striving for maximizing economic utility,always following our best interest.Thus, using such a definition,everyone acting against his economical interest is irrational.According to this model - and today’s business thinking - if,for example,you want your employee to work harder,be more motivated and productive,you offer higher payments, right?Well,it turns out that when it comes to mental activities,high payments negatively affects motivation - reducing productivity.Instead,people get more productive by feeling autonomous and finding their work meaningful.This is,by now, a well studied and established fact that business totally ignores.To my mind,irrational is a model that tries to adjust it’s members to it’s assumptions instead of adjusting itself to it’s members - ignoring the destructive consequences.This is the rational agent model that runs ,for most part,our economy.On the contrary,what behavioral economics does,is to ignore all the assumptions and study how people actually behave and make decisions,in practice.The results are extremely intriguing and shows how deep our all too human flaws span,affecting virtually every aspects of ours lives.The main goal of the book is to explore how we can benefit by understanding these innate flaws.It's the upside of irrationality.On the one side,find artificial solutions for negative flaws such as procrastination and our limited empathy and on the other,embrace our positive ones such as our need for autonomy and meaning in labor.What i appreciate most in Dan’s work,is it’s clarity and vividness.He explains in great detail his well constructed case studies on which he mostly draws his conclusion,using minimum theorizing,leaving little,if no,room for misinterpreting the results.Although it’s not as intriguing as predictably irrational,it’s still a worthy and fun read.For those interested in the content but not willing to read the entire thing,there is a great one-hour lecture done by Dan that summarizes pretty much everything on the book. "
19,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17709230-winston-jen,5,"Following up on his blockbuster hit Predictably Irrational, Ariely presents us with a whole slew of new arguments and experiments that rip apart ""rational"" economic assumptions. In actuality, rational economic assumptions only work on the basis of financial gain, and ignore half of the brain, the emotional half, that has a greater impact upon our decisions and actions (largely in part because it is a more primitive portion of our brains).Chapter 1 is an entertaining look at how monetary incentives can pile on the pressure, leading to choking and sub-par performance. This seems to be true in every aspect of work, based on the most recent research we have. Ariely does proffer a solution - offer incentives every few years, rather than annually, to prevent employees from focusing on the prize towards the end of the year, and thereby having their thoughts in the clouds instead of their noses to the grindstone. Sadly, such advice is often ignored of treated with derision by business executives (whose salaries are at stake).Every chapter is more entertaining and enlightening than the last. Perhaps the research with the most long-lasting impact is Chapter 5, which deals with game theory and revenge. Even when economically disadvantageous (pay the researchers a dollar, and they will strip your opponent of double that), most people who have been wronged will seek to get their own back. While counter-intuitive, it actually makes perfect sense from an emotional viewpoint, and is not truly ""irrational.""As one might expect, people have an internal bias toward their own achievements and ideas. Taking a step back, learning more about the field (be it origami or quantum mechanics) can help individuals dampen this bias and evaluate their own efforts and ideas more objectively. The experiments required the participants to value their own creations soon after creating them, after all.The infamous ""shredder"" experiment also features prominently, and provides a considerable deal of black humour. The point is unmistakable, whether applied to employment or school. Similarly, we tend to take things out of proportion. When faced with an abandoned child in our neighbourhood (or presented with images from across the globe), we tend to respond with more dollars and hours of aid."

21,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2963285-kanti-brahma,3,"Dan Ariely has divided the books into two broad parts: Part 1- The unexpected way we defy logic at work and Part 2- The unexpected way we defy logic at home. Each part has five chapters covering five different areas where so called rational human being behaves irrationally.Why and bonuses work in motivating employees? How much bonus should be paid to employees performing physical work and mental work? When do we derive joy from our work, how comes the sense of contribution? Do people satisfy themselves with compensation despite having no attachment for the work they are performing? Is there actually an upside of revenge, why people inflict pain upon themselves to teach lessons to others? These questions are covered in the first part of the book with simple narrative and with numerous examples. The second part primarily deals with ability to adapt, emotion and decision making.Most of the conclusions and finding of the book will look logical if you already know that rational man is not so rational. However, the beauty of the book is the gamut of experiments conducted to validate the logical aspects of irrationality. Dan Ariely adds his own experiences, esp. with burn injuries to elaborate some of the points. A good book to understand how you and the world around you behave in various situations. Dan goes further to explain how the irrational side could be harnessed for the benefit of companies, society and at a personal level. Worth spending your time and money for this 334 page book. "
22,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,5,"This was just like its predecessor Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, but with a bit more personal information about Dan Ariely himself. Not just personal - downright intimate! Interspersed with the experiments and his conclusions are stories of how being a burn victim shaped his life, and the overall effect makes him highly believable in his descriptions of human behavior. I highly recommend this book and its predecessor. But read them in order; they make more sense that way. "
23,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1369028-phil,5,"A fantastic psychology book backed up by legitimate experiments!Unlike some psychology writings,Tthe Upside of Irrationality uses the scientific method and carefully designed experiments to validate (or refute) the hypothesis of the author/psychologist/scientist. The experiments were all simply explained and then the data was correlated with the final findings. This book is a refreshing change from today's world of rhetoric and inane internet commenting backed up solely by people's biased opinions. The principles explained were interesting, engaging, and thought-provoking. Dan Ariely comes off as a true expert in his field and this book makes readers (or at least this one) want to read more of his material. "

A series of hypotheses with regards to human behavior under the control of psychological quirks such as revenge, self-herding, etc.I found the topics mostly amusing and practical. I also felt that the book is very well-written with a nice sense of humor. The author also opens up about his experience through a terrible accident and how he recovered.Although this book is written after the author's previous book (Predictably Irrational), it is a seperate matter and the name of that book is mentioned only twice.In the end I recommend this book to all people who are interested in social economics and would like to learn more about human behavior."

He motivates a lot of the content via personal anecdotes, explaining why he decided to pursue certain research questions. Not sure that adds much to the learning you can derive from the book, but is an interesting insight into how a researcher chooses what to dive into."

Some of them are interesting. However, the experiments weren't as detailed as I would have liked, raising more questions than answering them."
29,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4060448-sundarraj-kaushik,3,"This books, as the name indicates, tries to highlight the flip side of irrationality. Some of the observations are as under.High bonuses do not necessarily translate in better performance. When the bonus goes beyond a point the apprehension to perform hinders the performance of the person and they end up delivering less than they could have, if the bonus had been nominal. Although irrational, it probably make sense to temper the bonus offered. Besides the money is not the only driver to performance. Other factors like how much the person enjoys the work, the completion of the tasks and seeing their output being useful to the organization or others are other motivating factors.People value their creation more than anybody else's, however mediocre the outcome may be. This is called the IKEA effect. The corollary of this is the ""Not-Invented-Here"" bias. People tend to reinvent the wheel or continue to use inefficient tools and processes just because they happen to have been invented by them or in the organization. A classic example that is quoted is that of Thomas Edison who failed to see the value in the Alternating Current invented by Tesla and continued to blow the trumpet of Direct Current. It is said he even went to the extent of killing animals using AC to prove his point.Fear of revenge is a very big deterrent. One way to reduce the reduce the chances of revenge and/or to reduce the severity of revenge is to apologize unconditionally. An example is that if Jefferey Katzenberg who left Disney in a huff and went on to establish Dreamworks SKG and produced very successful films like Shrek and extracted further revenge by parodying his boss from Disney, Micheal Eisner in those films.Humans are extremely adaptable. From our eyes adjusting to variations in light to our mind getting adjusted to a loss or tempering after a big success. Humans tend to bounce back normalcy. It is only a matter of time. This is further strengthened by the fact that people who have endured pain which has benefited them (like removal of bandages from wound) have a better endurance than ones who have not endured much pain.Pleasure of pain if interrupted stretches longer. So it makes a lot of sense to finish a painful task than taking breaks and taking breaks in a pleasurable task.People show more empathy and emotion towards people who they are close to or relate to or have something in common than to others. Individual appeal (a cancer patient or a child suffering from a congenital problem) draws more attention, sympathy, empathy and more grants than a mass appeal (refugees in Rwanda or tsunami victims in Asia). Global warming does not make people change their way because they are effected; there is no dramatic effect; the effect is not immediate; and we feel as an individual we will have no significant effect (this is called the drop in the ocean effect).We get emotional and make decisions under these circumstances and act. Later when encountered with the same or a similar situation we tend to act the same way. This is because we remember the action, but not the emotion under which we acted.A good follow up read."
30,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."

If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

It's a fascinating book which explores human behavior and provides insights and glimpses into why people behave the way they do. The author also explores how irrational behavior can benefit us, in the right context. If you're interested in understanding human behavior, this book will provide some fascinating insights that you can apply in your life and work."
35,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75803049-priya-p,4,"it's a non fiction. People pick up non fictions on the basis of critical reviews. this is a 3.5 star read. Ariely is a friendly enough writer who can keep his audience engaged with the narrative but could it have been more concise and yet just as relevant? Answer is a resounding yes. For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

The format is the same: ""Problem - Experiment - Conclusion - What we can do to improve"". This is also the message of the book: ""Know your problem (with emotional influence), experiment and find a way to get over it""."

Or....perhaps, if I read this book first and then read the PI second, I would give this book 5 stars and PI 4 stars. The reason for that is: the books are similar. I found many insight during the first book reading. But, once a reader get the overall ideas, it will become a smooth sailing with only few treasures to pick up along the way."

I learnt a lot of things about myself, I enjoyed reading about the experiments and really liked the author. I am new at all this non-fiction stuff but I would definitely read more about behavioral economics - surprisingly for me it's helpful and not boring at all!"

47,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

I gave up around the 70% mark, which seems to be a completion of any other book, considering this sucker was so dang long. Note to self: some researchers and scientists like repetition.

49,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73040606-wade-eyerly,5,"A fantastic read. This book explores how we think - which gets to the heart of a number of seemingly illogical decisions we, as humans, make. It leaves the reader with tools that can be applied in their home, their relationships and their business to improve decision-making. Better than Freakonomics - and I liked Freakonomics."
50,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56583220-arsen-lazursky,3,"Kinda meh, I think. 1. Would have been a lot easier to digest as an article, rather than an entire book. 2. Some of the things here are too captain obvious. 3. Some of the experiments seem rather far-fetched in terms of what they are trying to achieve"
51,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22728948-laxman-selvam,5,"Amazing insights into our everyday, so called rational, decision making only to make us understand how intriguingly irrational we are. Dan, you are now a permanent in my favourite authors' list."
52,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10490510-alexandra,5,Really insightful book ! Loved how it starts from an actual story/case and builds in the human psychology facts. Well documented and written without the heavy language of a science book !

54,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"
55,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8405080-soundview-executive-book-summaries,5,"The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home by Dan Ariely was chosen by Soundview Executive Book Summaries as one of the Top 30 Business Books of 2011.THE SOUNDVIEW REVIEW:Social scientist Dan Ariely delivered some of the most fascinating research in recent memory with his 2008 best-seller Predictably Irrational. The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
56,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
57,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
58,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ?

And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
60,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."

If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace.

Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level.

Ariely is a friendly enough writer who can keep his audience engaged with the narrative but could it have been more concise and yet just as relevant? Answer is a resounding yes. For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

77,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"

The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
86,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
87,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
88,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ? "
89,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"The Upside Of Irrationality is, of course, the sequel to Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
90,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."
91,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,3,"“Bad decision making behaviors that manifested themselves as mere nuisances in earlier centuries can now severely affect our lies in critical ways.”We are, as human beings, a cavalcade of irrational tendencies. If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace.

Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level.

It's a fascinating book which explores human behavior and provides insights and glimpses into why people behave the way they do.

For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

107,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

112,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10490510-alexandra,5,Really insightful book ! Loved how it starts from an actual story/case and builds in the human psychology facts. Well documented and written without the heavy language of a science book !
113,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742005-siddhartha-kumar,3,"I read somewhere that no matter how much aware we become of our cognitive biases, when push comes to shove, we still end up behaving the same way. Goes to show the fickle nature of humanity."
114,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"

The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
116,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
117,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
118,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ? "
119,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"The Upside Of Irrationality is, of course, the sequel to Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
120,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."
121,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,3,"“Bad decision making behaviors that manifested themselves as mere nuisances in earlier centuries can now severely affect our lies in critical ways.”We are, as human beings, a cavalcade of irrational tendencies. If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace.

Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level.

It's a fascinating book which explores human behavior and provides insights and glimpses into why people behave the way they do.

Ariely is a friendly enough writer who can keep his audience engaged with the narrative but could it have been more concise and yet just as relevant? Answer is a resounding yes. For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

136,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13537542-dawn,3,Half way interesting look into human behavior.
137,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

I gave up around the 70% mark, which seems to be a completion of any other book, considering this sucker was so dang long. Note to self: some researchers and scientists like repetition. I get it.... ;)"
139,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73040606-wade-eyerly,5,"A fantastic read. This book explores how we think - which gets to the heart of a number of seemingly illogical decisions we, as humans, make. It leaves the reader with tools that can be applied in their home, their relationships and their business to improve decision-making. Better than Freakonomics - and I liked Freakonomics."

Some of the things here are too captain obvious. 3. Some of the experiments seem rather far-fetched in terms of what they are trying to achieve"

142,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10490510-alexandra,5,Really insightful book ! Loved how it starts from an actual story/case and builds in the human psychology facts. Well documented and written without the heavy language of a science book !

144,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"
145,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8405080-soundview-executive-book-summaries,5,"The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home by Dan Ariely was chosen by Soundview Executive Book Summaries as one of the Top 30 Business Books of 2011.THE SOUNDVIEW REVIEW:Social scientist Dan Ariely delivered some of the most fascinating research in recent memory with his 2008 best-seller Predictably Irrational. The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
146,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
147,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
148,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ? "
149,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"The Upside Of Irrationality is, of course, the sequel to Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
150,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."
151,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,3,"“Bad decision making behaviors that manifested themselves as mere nuisances in earlier centuries can now severely affect our lies in critical ways.”We are, as human beings, a cavalcade of irrational tendencies. If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace. Recommended reading for anyone who interacts with others in the workplace."
153,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17277009-sangwon-hyun,5,"This book is an insightful investigation into ways in which we make imperfect decisions because of our built-in fallacies and biases and unknown tendencies (""irrationality""). Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level. Looking forward to the next one!"

It's a fascinating book which explores human behavior and provides insights and glimpses into why people behave the way they do. The author also explores how irrational behavior can benefit us, in the right context. If you're interested in understanding human behavior, this book will provide some fascinating insights that you can apply in your life and work."
155,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75803049-priya-p,4,"it's a non fiction. People pick up non fictions on the basis of critical reviews. this is a 3.5 star read. Ariely is a friendly enough writer who can keep his audience engaged with the narrative but could it have been more concise and yet just as relevant? Answer is a resounding yes. For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

The format is the same: ""Problem - Experiment - Conclusion - What we can do to improve"". This is also the message of the book: ""Know your problem (with emotional influence), experiment and find a way to get over it""."

Or....perhaps, if I read this book first and then read the PI second, I would give this book 5 stars and PI 4 stars. The reason for that is: the books are similar. I found many insight during the first book reading. But, once a reader get the overall ideas, it will become a smooth sailing with only few treasures to pick up along the way."

167,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

169,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73040606-wade-eyerly,5,"A fantastic read. This book explores how we think - which gets to the heart of a number of seemingly illogical decisions we, as humans, make. It leaves the reader with tools that can be applied in their home, their relationships and their business to improve decision-making. Better than Freakonomics - and I liked Freakonomics."
170,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56583220-arsen-lazursky,3,"Kinda meh, I think. 1. Would have been a lot easier to digest as an article, rather than an entire book. 2. Some of the things here are too captain obvious. 3. Some of the experiments seem rather far-fetched in terms of what they are trying to achieve"
171,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22728948-laxman-selvam,5,"Amazing insights into our everyday, so called rational, decision making only to make us understand how intriguingly irrational we are. Dan, you are now a permanent in my favourite authors' list."
172,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10490510-alexandra,5,Really insightful book ! Loved how it starts from an actual story/case and builds in the human psychology facts. Well documented and written without the heavy language of a science book !

174,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"
175,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8405080-soundview-executive-book-summaries,5,"The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home by Dan Ariely was chosen by Soundview Executive Book Summaries as one of the Top 30 Business Books of 2011.THE SOUNDVIEW REVIEW:Social scientist Dan Ariely delivered some of the most fascinating research in recent memory with his 2008 best-seller Predictably Irrational. The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
176,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
177,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
178,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ?

And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
180,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."

If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace.

Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level.

For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy!

197,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

204,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"

The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
206,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
207,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
208,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ? "
209,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"The Upside Of Irrationality is, of course, the sequel to Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
210,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."
211,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,3,"“Bad decision making behaviors that manifested themselves as mere nuisances in earlier centuries can now severely affect our lies in critical ways.”We are, as human beings, a cavalcade of irrational tendencies. If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace.

Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level.

For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

226,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13537542-dawn,3,Half way interesting look into human behavior.
227,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

232,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10490510-alexandra,5,Really insightful book ! Loved how it starts from an actual story/case and builds in the human psychology facts. Well documented and written without the heavy language of a science book !
233,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742005-siddhartha-kumar,3,"I read somewhere that no matter how much aware we become of our cognitive biases, when push comes to shove, we still end up behaving the same way. Goes to show the fickle nature of humanity."
234,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"

The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
236,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
237,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
238,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ? "
239,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"The Upside Of Irrationality is, of course, the sequel to Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
240,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."
241,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,3,"“Bad decision making behaviors that manifested themselves as mere nuisances in earlier centuries can now severely affect our lies in critical ways.”We are, as human beings, a cavalcade of irrational tendencies. If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace.

Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level.

It's a fascinating book which explores human behavior and provides insights and glimpses into why people behave the way they do.

Ariely is a friendly enough writer who can keep his audience engaged with the narrative but could it have been more concise and yet just as relevant? Answer is a resounding yes. For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

256,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13537542-dawn,3,Half way interesting look into human behavior.
257,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

I gave up around the 70% mark, which seems to be a completion of any other book, considering this sucker was so dang long. Note to self: some researchers and scientists like repetition. I get it.... ;)"
259,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73040606-wade-eyerly,5,"A fantastic read. This book explores how we think - which gets to the heart of a number of seemingly illogical decisions we, as humans, make. It leaves the reader with tools that can be applied in their home, their relationships and their business to improve decision-making. Better than Freakonomics - and I liked Freakonomics."

Some of the things here are too captain obvious. 3. Some of the experiments seem rather far-fetched in terms of what they are trying to achieve"

262,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10490510-alexandra,5,Really insightful book ! Loved how it starts from an actual story/case and builds in the human psychology facts. Well documented and written without the heavy language of a science book !

264,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"
265,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8405080-soundview-executive-book-summaries,5,"The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home by Dan Ariely was chosen by Soundview Executive Book Summaries as one of the Top 30 Business Books of 2011.THE SOUNDVIEW REVIEW:Social scientist Dan Ariely delivered some of the most fascinating research in recent memory with his 2008 best-seller Predictably Irrational. The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
266,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
267,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
268,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ? "
269,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"The Upside Of Irrationality is, of course, the sequel to Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
270,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"I enjoy Ariely's look at the sometimes weird things that we do. He's a behavioral economist / social scientist and there's plenty of evidence to show that we humans are definitely not rational in our decision-making. But we knew that already - Mr Spock keeps telling us we're too emotional. We ""cut off our nose to spite our face"" - when offered a split of $2/$18 with an anonymous person, do we keep the $2 (because we'd be ahead of the game) or reject it (losing the $2 but also punishing the offering person who loses the $18)? You know the answer. What about bonuses? Do they improve performance? The answer here is a bit murkier and it depends. If you do work that menial and boring, it can motivate. But for creative work, the answer is no. So, those big bonuses paid to CEOs have no rational basis. Ariely explores why we are more moved by the plight of one person rather than millions and why we enjoy adding our own touches to cooking and furniture. There's a lot about dating (which makes me glad I'm happily married for almost 38 years). Overall, it's interesting and thought-provoking.Quotes to remember:Either way we know two things: it's difficult to create the optimal incentive structure for people and higher incentives don't always lead to the highest performance...The way we pay people can have powerful, unintended consequences.If you take people who love something...and you place them in meaningful working conditions, the joy they derive from the activity is going to be a major driver in dictating their level of effort. However, if you take the same people with the same initial passion and desire and place them in meaningless working conditions, you can very easily kill any internal joy they might derive from the activity.This experiment taught us that sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor.The word ""sorry"" completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. For handy future reference, here's the magic formula: One annoyance + One apology = Zero annoyance.It turns out that we are very good at conceiving the future but we can't foresee how we will adapt to it. It's difficult to imagine that over time you might get used to the changes in your lifestyle, adapt to your injury, and find that it's not as terrible as you once thought. It's even harder to imagine discovering new and unexpected joys in your new situation....we are willing to spend money, time, and effort to help identifiable victims, yet fail to act when confronted with statistical victims."
271,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,3,"“Bad decision making behaviors that manifested themselves as mere nuisances in earlier centuries can now severely affect our lies in critical ways.”We are, as human beings, a cavalcade of irrational tendencies. If you’re in dispute of this, then I should thank you for proving it to be true. The vast amount of literature and research compiled and verified unquestionably shows that although we like to consider ourselves rational and considerate creatures, we are anything but.Not all is lost however. Dan Ariely, author of many insightful books on human nature such as Predictably Irrational, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Payoff, has set out to demonstrate the ways we can turn our rabid irrationality into a strength with The Upside of Irrationality. “Given the mismatch between the speed of technological development and human evolution, the same instincts and abilities that once helped us now stand in our way.”Though treading over some familiar ground for those versed in Behavioral Economics this book does a sublime job of unveiling how a human being truly operates. It explores the unexpected ways we defy logic at work and home, while also providing the reader with some lessons for damping down the pull of irrational behavior in our lives.We are irrational by nature and I’m certain that with a little self-examination we can find evidence to support this (being a Phillies fan is the first, most obvious example of this in my life). But a little irrationality can have some advantages, so long as we appreciate the imperfections that can benefit us.“Emotion can easily affect decisions and this can happen when the emotions have nothing to do with the decisions themselves.”If we can recognize what behaviors serve us well and which ones we would like to overcome is a great starting point. From there, Ariely argues, that we can design the world around us in such a way that we can take advantage of some of our incredible abilities while overcoming our limitations.The Upside of Irrationality is a book about looking at the bright side of our quirks and turning them into opportunities for making better decisions and living happier and healthier lives, starting with reconsidering my Phillies fandom, and working from there. Overall Score: 3.7 / 5In a Sentence: the best thing we can do about our irrational behavior is figure out how to leverage it toward a better living."

He may have however inadvertently created a monster because I readily consumed Ariely's next book which evaluates the positive sides of our irrational human behaviour.Wow wow wow.....to learn about resistance to NIH....Not invented here.....might explain why our department resists thoughts and changes that come from outside the department......and how as individuals we can make others be onboard about an idea by making them think it was their idea.I really enjoyed the chapter about the irrational way we make decisions and behave when we are emotional and angry......haha I listened to this chapter on a day in which I just felt furious....Ariely makes solid points by using his own irrational angry behaviour which simply makes you laugh....especially if you have just ended your own ""shit"" day and realise you have behaved in exactly the same way.....ho humI really loved this book and I feel it has made me a more rational manager and leader in the workplace. Recommended reading for anyone who interacts with others in the workplace."
273,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17277009-sangwon-hyun,5,"This book is an insightful investigation into ways in which we make imperfect decisions because of our built-in fallacies and biases and unknown tendencies (""irrationality""). Arguments are backed by solid social science research results, explained in detail and alongside interesting and relatable anecdotes as convincing examples. A large emphasis of the book is to urge to experiment and question our decision-making (individually, and as a group or society) so as to understand our tendencies and to make better, more optimal decisions. I've read several of Dan Ariely's books now, and he is invariably a wonderful storyteller capable of explaining complicated concepts and experiments at just the right level. Looking forward to the next one!"

It's a fascinating book which explores human behavior and provides insights and glimpses into why people behave the way they do. The author also explores how irrational behavior can benefit us, in the right context. If you're interested in understanding human behavior, this book will provide some fascinating insights that you can apply in your life and work."
275,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75803049-priya-p,4,"it's a non fiction. People pick up non fictions on the basis of critical reviews. this is a 3.5 star read. Ariely is a friendly enough writer who can keep his audience engaged with the narrative but could it have been more concise and yet just as relevant? Answer is a resounding yes. For the size of the book I expected a whole lot more of learnings. Knowledge monster in me is not happy! Though Ariely himself is a fascinating guy - I'd say, as a human being he rates much higher in my eyes from what little he shows of himself and his own life in this book."

The format is the same: ""Problem - Experiment - Conclusion - What we can do to improve"". This is also the message of the book: ""Know your problem (with emotional influence), experiment and find a way to get over it""."

Or....perhaps, if I read this book first and then read the PI second, I would give this book 5 stars and PI 4 stars. The reason for that is: the books are similar. I found many insight during the first book reading. But, once a reader get the overall ideas, it will become a smooth sailing with only few treasures to pick up along the way."

I learnt a lot of things about myself, I enjoyed reading about the experiments and really liked the author.

287,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23868111-swapnil,4,"The book has a pretty clear cut structure with anecdotes depicting irrational behavior at workplace or home being followed by research trial to test possible hypothesis to explain said behavior. The book starts with investigation on incentives and how conventional methods suggest linear relation between incentives and outcomes, specifically that of CEO's. Dan suggests alternative that is siply not the case since like all things economical , there is a diminishing rate of return but he goes one step further to suggest a inverted U shape curve that suggests performance not only stop increasing at increasing rate but starts decreasing after a point. The research trial involves two groups being given simple and complex tasks but with exorbitant increments in payment for task. As expected, people when paid way too high for complex tasks had detrimental performance due to high stakes of the problem coupled with complexity. Loss aversion was added to mix of trial , where participant would be allowed to keep fraction of money earned if they achieved a certain level of performance with prepayment to simulate marketplace bonuses. The result being high incentives lead to high performance in mechanical tasks only but as soon as cognition is required to complete it, everything goes haywire. Adding different elements like social pressure only adds more woes to the problem. Next comes labor and how people define more meaning to their to work and hence perform better if they know their work will be of use or of any consequence. He argues how division of labor though efficient inst exactly effective since people prefer earning their living rather than being handed down. Demonstrated via Jensen's experiment on rats and how animals prefer earning their food pellets despite presence of free food available. According to him we see great value in our labor and wish to see meaning derived from it and not just earning our reward. In many ways, we see labor as means of fulfillment. However it isn't very clear what the meaning is and in what domain do we seek it? Is it because we want to be social contributors or is it a intrinsic drive developed from years of evolutionary process at work. Either way, what drives our efforts is the thought we are doing something meaningful and Dan recommends the occasional pat on the back goes a long way and people devoid of meaning in their work will ultimately be worse of at their jobs. Moving from how to improve efforts of people we move on to how people perceive their efforts , explained through IKEA analogy wherein people overvalue their own work and ideas simply because of the effort put in by them. This sounds like cousin of confirmation bias and Dan goes a long way to prove it is so much more than that. In an origami design trial where participants made their own origami in normal and difficult conditions, they were asked to bid the highest amount in an auction against computer. To no surprise people always overbid for their own creations against an objective measure especially if the task itself was difficult than usual. Not only that expert origami valued by objective standard was bid roughly to same extent as novice ones if they had made the origami themselves. However, this attachment to our creation is limited by caveat that we only value it if we complete the task at hand, hence, any task given to us when competed becomes overvalued. This should help you cope with the fact that people aren't always going to pay the same homage to your work as you expect them to but that's simply because of our own bias and says more about us rather than our creation. Next is similar not invented here bias where people overvalue their own idea over others demonstrated by poll done in NYT where participants were asked to give solutions to some problems and asked to rate them on their ""goodness"". Of course people preferred their ideas despite controlling for objectivity or idiosyncratic fit (where people prefer ideas that are in congruence with their world belief system). Moral of the story being ideas are not only evaluated on their objective goodness but also how they are constructed, greater the collaboration in constructing them , higher is the adaptability of ideas. Next Dan speaks on our tendency for revenge which i am not sure how it seeps in to the work aspect but let's put that aside, we see that human even chimps have inherent sense of right and wrong emanating from co operation and how we retaliate to non cooperation. Experiment designed to test this hypothesis showed that people have very sensitive compass for what is fair and what isn't. A slight mishap can throw people ointo revenge seeing behavior as demonstrated by social faux pas included in trial. Even if the faux pas was on done by agent, the principal was not safe from harm inflicted i.e. people would simply hurt just to see themselves at ease and revenge seeking is incredibly brutal and straightforward. the silver lining being that it doesn't take much to mitigate this behavior, a simple acknowledgement of mistake can go a long way in cooling revenge seeking behavior. Next up is the human adaptability and how we can adapt to pain as long as we see some meaning in it. If pain is endured in pursuit of some positive result, we can adapt to it in time. On flip side to pain , our pleasure seeking also follows similar patterns wherein we adapt to pleasures of life pretty easily and nothing is ever lasting as we expect it to be. What is interesting its that transient pleasures are better way to extend our happiness rather than continuous hedonistic pleasure. Stagger the pleasure and bundle the pain. No pain or pleasure is forever, this too shall is the basic idea behind this hypothesis (many apocryphal ideas seem to be the basis of this book). What is interesting is that what seems pleasurable/painful in short term won't be the as painful or pleasurable in long term since we are on a constant hedonistic treadmill. This based on human inability to predict the degree of adaptability and not necessarily on the degree of pleasure in future. We simply get used to anything, no matter how painful or pleasurable. Next comes the adaptability of human mate section process wherein people would simply adapt their own shortcomings (both physical or emotional) in time through prioritization of what is considered important in selecting a partner. Interesting study through polls from website ""HOT or NOT"" show people are well aware of their ranking in social hierarchy and what is objectively desirable is always universally constant but that doesn't bother them much since people will adapt to success through prioritization of what they look in their mate. This is termed as assortative mating which was demonstrated in speed dating experiment. My only contention being where is the irrational behavior in this since this seems as the most rational behavior anyone can indulge in, but that depends largely on what we consider rational. Not much of lesson to be learnt here but more of an observation to help us make feel a little better perhaps. Moving from rational participants to the market of dating -online dating. Here lies the problem of people looking for a partner through objective measures like weight height and so on but it goes against the idea that people choose their partners through experiential traits that are not easily quantified. Moreover people prefer window shopping aspect of online dating rather than the one on one interactions. Elaborate methods of selection based on common interests are no better but what does work is the sharing of experiences together. When people experience the world they show their judgements about the world rather than any specific trait desired by the other person. You want to choose a partner, our author would suggest that you go canoeing together first and then see if you still want to go ahead after the experience since it will a better judge of compatibility than anything that can be quantified or shared. Next up our author deals with human apathy and how re framing problem in a personalized fashion can evoke greater response or shake us out of apathy due to vividness, proximity and drop in the bucket phenomenon where we believe our response will actually have an impact on the problem. In fact, looking at suffering from purely rational mode makes us apathetic and we are driven to bring change from emotional state and not purely rational especially if the scale of problem is large enough that we feel our contribution would be pointless. This being the reason why Baby Jessica earned world's attention while Rwanda genocide couldn't get the attention it deserved. This being one of the problems ,of course, in the latter case. It's like what Stalin said , ""one man's death is a tragedy, but a million is statistic"", we cannot deal with problems of empathy through rational mindset alone , which is what American Cancer society understands in the way they seek donations for their survivors, wherein the umbrella of suffering is personalized and generalized enough to evoke emotions and hence action. But this is especially important in understanding how to pay our attention to problems rationally, not every problem has a poster child like Global warming or Malaria but we can use one , however, this at the same time requires policy makes to pay attention more so than ever. The last lesson being an especially important one wherein we seek to dismantle our emotions through immediate action in short term but this ended up being carried in general sense to our future actions. For example , as described by author, an off day that manifests at wrong time during work can set similar precedent for future since we contextualize everything we do as we go forward, even the times we were acting irrational, something that our author calls self-herding. We take up our bandwagon of previous decisions and forget the emotional drive behind our last decision and continue making same decisions in the long term since we remember actions better than emotions. This was brilliantly demonstrated in the Ultimatum game , where sender has to make split offer of lets sat 20 dollars, lets say if they make offer of 8 to receiver and keep 12 to themselves, and if the receiver deems it fair they can keep their share but if not then no one gets anything. The emotion at play being the one of fairness and revenge. People were however primed using positive and negative emotion inducing incident to see if the effect of emotions persisted i their decision making. Lo and behold, it did , people who were positively primed were generous in accepting the offers more than negative ones. The game was further played to see if when emotions subsisted, was the effect still evident? In next leg of trial, roles were reversed to see if people repeated action under specific conditions or in generalized fashion where past action act as guide to future action. As expected people use past action as guide foe future decisions. Moral of the story being, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Look for your biases when it comes to decision making, the book seems like a new guide to old sayings and might end up being dry but the way these biases are tested is more interesting than the results themselves. Best for learning about self than the world. "

289,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73040606-wade-eyerly,5,"A fantastic read. This book explores how we think - which gets to the heart of a number of seemingly illogical decisions we, as humans, make. It leaves the reader with tools that can be applied in their home, their relationships and their business to improve decision-making. Better than Freakonomics - and I liked Freakonomics."
290,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56583220-arsen-lazursky,3,"Kinda meh, I think. 1. Would have been a lot easier to digest as an article, rather than an entire book. 2. Some of the things here are too captain obvious. 3. Some of the experiments seem rather far-fetched in terms of what they are trying to achieve"
291,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22728948-laxman-selvam,5,"Amazing insights into our everyday, so called rational, decision making only to make us understand how intriguingly irrational we are. Dan, you are now a permanent in my favourite authors' list."
292,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10490510-alexandra,5,Really insightful book ! Loved how it starts from an actual story/case and builds in the human psychology facts. Well documented and written without the heavy language of a science book !

294,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"Well alas this book yet again show that there are problems with human thought without ever talking about how to over come them or about solutions. I read this book, to see if the author would ponder upon the solution to his previous work here, but it was disappointing. Like his previous Book I had to read this one multiple times, because the thing that he talks about is quite small i.e. tiny, micro but the shell and the onion peels he builds around it is so huge that you will be lost in the prose about experiments, about variations and non-sensical examples and what I hate the most about this author is that he has this Obsessive need to talk about his burn wounds, Yes, if he has the need to push it into his books he could have dedicated a separate appendix or foreword for it. VALUE ADDED TO ME BY THE BOOK:But, i have learned one good thing, i.e. a good advice that i use everyday If you hate doing something, do it one go, no matter how long it takes, 10 hours, 20 hours etc... Do it without taking a break, If you hate doing something do it in one swing.If you love doing something, take as many breaks as you can, because since you love doing it you will come back to it anyway! So take many breaks and make the experience more pleasurable.I use this HACK for my studies, when I hate a subject, I would go full time into it, start to end! Works very well.ONE PART THAT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME:Contrafreelaoding - People/animals etc.. love to take food after doing some action, makes more sense, follows the necessity to find meaning in work - BUT THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE - CATSI loved this part!BACK TO THE REVIEW:LET ME ASK A QUESTION ""IF SOMEBODY TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOME RARE DISEASE"" but never told you about how to cure it or what you should going further, would the knowledge of me having the disease make me any better? Of course notI could not rank his books any higher than three starts. Because, the content seems so trivial often and over stretched. One full chapter to discuss about revenge - Come on!One more chapter dedicated to discuss the pain and pleasure maximization and related economics? Again OH! God.This book is extremely similar to the last book. While he discussed about a few cognitive biases in his previous book, this book deals particularly with human irrationalities over specific emotions, i.e. dedicated to an individual i.e. understanding his quirks when does he get angry, when does he become peaceful, what does he do when he can't think! How does he react in pain, so all of these are human emotions which are dealt carefully in one chapter at a time.The entire book can be summarized merely using the headings of the chapters1. Paying more for less - Why Big Bonuses don't always work What happens when you overload money and demand more work - due to pressure performance diminishes. The irrationality discussed here is ""PRESSURE"" and ""HIGH STAKES""MORAL: Pay in proportion to your employees, don't overpay and of course don't underpay.Think twice when doing what you know for inflated costs, it might disrupt your performance2. The Meaning of Labor - What legos can teach about the joy of workIf you destroy or derogate people's work before their eyes they become extremely bitter i.e. people demand meaningful work and search for meaning in their work. The irrationality discussed here is the ""LOGOS"" or ""DESIRE FOR MEANING"" in everything.MORAL: LEARN TO DISSOCIATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR WORK - IMPOSSIBLE - You say? Then learn how to find meaning in what you do - Create meaning using various techniques (none of which are discussed in this book) Understand that everybody cannot find a job that has deep creative meaning and purpose. Some jobs are just dull and rote.3. The IKEA effect - Why we overvalue what we makeYou love your baby because you put so much effort into making it, but if it came easy, you wouldn't have loved it so much. The Irrationality described here is ""ATTACHMENT""MORAL: Understand that if you want to love someone more, make them work for it and vice-versa, If you want to love someone more - do put more effort i.e invest in them and they become yours.4. The Not-Invented here bias - Why ""my"" ideas are better than ""yours""Ownership of work or ideas or anything that belongs to you or if you think that it belongs to you will matter more to you. The irrationality is ""OWNERSHIP""MORAL: Learn to take ideas, things, concepts, people, animals, no matter where they come from, try to dissociate your biases about ORIGINS, COLOR, RACE, LANGUAGES, etc...They might cause huge losses in the long run. Where it came from isn't as much important as how it can be used by you!5. The Case for Revenge - What makes us seek justice?Revenge is another inbuilt irrationality by natural selection. The need to seek justice and revenge are analyzed in depth.MORAL: Learn your irrational revenge to develop tenacity. Using revenge for productivity rather than to extract vengence on a person, by eliminating him or extracting harm. Instead extract vengence the other way around, growing higher and better.6. On Adaptation: Why we get used to things It is only new for the first few minutes hours and days after which it is just like any other thing in your life. So the author asks us to do new things all the time - This is also an inbuilt irrationality created by evolution ""DESENSITIZING"" or ""GETTING USED TO""MORAL: Get over your obsession with NEW, new things, new places, new , new , new, analyze situations looking into the future when the new will become normal. Evaluate with old in mind and then assess the value of something.7. Hot or Not? Adapatation - Assortive Mating and the Beauty MarketThis chapter and the one that followed it seemed the most trivial compared to the rest of the book.The hot or not experiments also focusses on another inbuilt irrationality ""VANITY""MORAL: Beauty isn't skin deep it is visible and it influences decisions in ways that can't be interpreted. So beauty does add value right away, though it might fade away later but it is easier to make immediate impressions. Beauty first.8. When market fails - An example from Online DatingCompares the age old practice of match making to the latest version of online match making and does a comparative analysis of their features explaining why the former was better. I did not see any irrationality here! Rather the disability of the hi-tech dating practice failing desperately to play up to the needs of the participants.The author offers some solutions as always but most of them are useless - not just to him or to the market but useless to anyone and everyone. Because they are extremely impractical.MORAL: Every Market is INEFFICIENT - there are no perfect markets i.e. there is always scope for arbitrage in the markets and it is your duty to track down the arbitrage!9. On Empathy and Emotion, - Why we respond to one person who needs help but not to manyHere the irrationality of proximity and relation and association of the person in need is the irrationality. Our inability to imagine, visualize or emapthize with the masses that we have not seen/felt/experienced are discussed here!MORAL: Rationalize, when you see a single individual and try to respond, image 100,000 individuals i.e. clones in the same state and then take a long term decision. 10. The Long term effects of Short Term emotionsThis is like a crux of the book, where the author tries to sum up what happens when we act on our irrationalities, i.e in the heat of the moment, when you overvalue your creations, when you seek revenge for the sake of revenge, when you empty your purse for an emotion, when you get too cosy with your environment etc... he talks about how to overcome these and prevent doing something that you might regret later.What i hate the most about the author is that he only discusses in extreme detail about the problem, in its various forms and varieties in which it can hit the observer. But rarely does he offer any good solution. It is irritating after a while.Chapter 11 - Lessons from our irrationalities Again this is a continuous chatter about irrationalities and examples, without offering any real solutions.HERE is a list of other books and other works that were mentioned, in between the lines.Victor Frankel's Man's Search for MeaningBlunderRecipes from the OvenThe Count of Monte CristoThe Man in the Iron MaskHedonic AdaptationIn Praise of SlownessThe Joyless EconomyLife as a House - MovieDrop in the bucket effect, Identifiable victim effect, Herding and Self-Herding"
295,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8405080-soundview-executive-book-summaries,5,"The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home by Dan Ariely was chosen by Soundview Executive Book Summaries as one of the Top 30 Business Books of 2011.THE SOUNDVIEW REVIEW:Social scientist Dan Ariely delivered some of the most fascinating research in recent memory with his 2008 best-seller Predictably Irrational. The book examined the mysteries of human foibles and provided some pretty convincing evidence to support the claim that mankind can be predictable in its ability to defy logic. Ariely definitely caused more than a few readers to hesitate before making what had previously been automatic judgments in a wide variety of situations.Now Ariely returns with the follow-up to Predictably Irrational. In The Upside of Irrationality, the Duke University professor provides a further look at the impact, both positive and negative, that irrational behavior can have on a person’s life. Aside from his unique perspective and groundbreaking research, Ariely is a wonderful storyteller. His sense of humor and ability to spin scientific data into memorable anecdotes shine in his latest book. The level of energy that makes him a sought-after lecturer shines through in chapter after chapter.Executives should pay particular attention to Ariely’s discussion of a phenomenon he calls “The IKEA Effect.” In this section of the book, Ariely discusses the reasons behind why we place a much higher (and skewed) value on something we ourselves create. It leads one to draw the conclusion that in a work context, the IKEA Effect explains why many individuals become overly defensive about their own projects. However, an executive could also determine from Ariely’s research that a key to employee engagement is to guide employees to undertake projects in which they have a personal stake and, therefore, an increased amount of passion for the work. It’s interesting to note that Ariely points out that completion of the task is a necessary ingredient to create the IKEA Effect.The book is a fast read and contains plenty of thought-provoking material for meetings. It will leave the reader wondering what area of human behavior will next fall under Ariely’s acute lens.Soundview's 8-page Executive Book Summary of The Upside of Irrationality is available here."
296,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"* * Once again, Dan Ariely (successfully and delightfully) takes on the school of rational economists who insist humans are ""rational, selfish, maximizing agents."" His research in the field of behavioral economics (as well as his keen insight developed from years of being human) has lead to his realization that: ""If we place human beings on a spectrum between the hyperrational Mr. Spock and the fallible Homer Simpson, we are closer to Homer than we realize.""Each chapter in this irresistible book takes a fascinating look at the irrational forces that move us away from Spock and more towards Homer:*We behave more irrationally when the incentives are high*We are less productive when we feel the work we are doing is not meaningful*We tend to over-value our own ideas and creations*We tend to under-value others' ideas and creations*Our desire for revenge is one of our most basic human drives, and as such, it is incredibly difficult to overcome*Our ability to adapt to both positive and negative experiences results in us often missing the mark when predicting our responses*Although our individual level of attractiveness does not change who we find ""hot or not,"" it does ultimately effect the relative importance we place on the ""deeper"" qualities of our (potential) mates*The most effective services and products are ones that accommodate to our ""Homer Simpson-likenesses""*Individual emotional appeals--and not hardcore facts and data about the struggling ""masses""--are the most effective ways to get us to respond to the suffering of others*Acting on our emotions is often the result of the leakage from our past experiences, as well as the cause of unhelpful future decisions and habits*We have oodles of irrational tendencies--most of which influence us in ways beyond our awarenessThat's the downside of irrationality. But, as the book's title broadcasts: there's an upside to irrationality too. Dan shows how these same irrational forces are also the exact traits that make us wonderfully human. They are what allow us to: find meaning from our work, trust others, adapt to changing circumstances, love our creations and ideas, care about others, and enjoy our imperfectly perfect lives.So, how do we become aware of the downsides of our irrational influences and harness their upsides? Ah...that's exactly what this book is all about. The secret to finding a comfortably human balance in the Mr. Spock/Homer Simpson spectrum lies within!"
297,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"WHAT I LOVEDGreat ideas. Very well researched & cited academically. Brilliant experiments. I actually enjoyed the creativity of the experiments the most.MISSING FROM THE BOOKSCan I use advice from this book in real life?Long-term practical results are missing. If you take all of these ""findings"" and apply them in real life, say with a group of employees or highschool students, for 4 or 5 years, would they work? or would people adapt quickly & neutralize the impact? This is what I still do not know.For example, Dan says that if you make people sign at the top of a form, then fill it, they are less likely to cheat. However, what if 90% of forms adapt this change, would its impact stick? or get neutralized?I liken this book to Tony Schwartz's first book about ""managing your energy"" - since it came from academia. However, he created the ""Energy Project"", and coached & advised real people to enhance their productivity for 20 years. Then he published the ""They way we're working isn't working"" book. This last book is great - because it combines the rigor of academic research & theory + 20 years actual experience of what actually works.MOREA great read. I have to say that enjoyed reading all 3 of Dan Ariely books. The main theme: unlike what economists assume, people act irrationally. However, you can ""predict"" this irrational behavior by looking at a number of psychological drivers. What are these drivers? and how can you use them to predict behavior? Each book looks at a number of these. First book (Predictably Irrational): stresses the fact that we are irrationalSecond book (this one - The upside of irrationality): looks at the positive impact of this irrationality on our lives - especially social life.Third book (about honesty & cheating): shows the irrational way people justify ""some"" cheating, what he calls a ""fudge factor"" - where we cheat, but we convince ourselves that it's not cheating."
298,0061995037,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15865386-amira,3,"4 stars because my benchmark for behavioural economics is one by Daniel Kahneman . I am relieved to be told that being irrational is not a bad thing all the time (again). I enjoy the book mainly because it describes the experiments Ariely et. al. or some other researchers did to understand human psychology and decision making. however, as Daniel Kahneman puts it, the challenge in learning psychology is not acquiring new facts, but how we change our own behaviours according to the new facts (or something to this effect). For example, i know now i tend to overvalue my own ideas and creations, seek justice (or revenge for that matter), underestimate my adaptability under unknown situations. I also learn that online dating sites are example of market failure , being rational reduces empathy/sympathy and making decision under emotion, be it happy or the opposite, affect long term decision. How would i change knowing the above, is the real challenge. My take: if you're looking for insights on your own decision making, this is one to read. If you think you are entirely rational homo sapiens , read the book just to challenge your belief. One question though, i wonder if all observations described in the book (i suppose mainly done in the US) can be extrapolated to our part of the world or other part of the world i.e is demographic an influencing factor in decision making ?

And I love Predictably Irrational for personal (and thus irrational) reasons. It was the book that kickstarted my interest in behavioral economics and made me think I picked the right MSc program when I saw it on the required reading list. (I'm now teaching the course which uses it. The hunted became the hunter.)Thing is, The Upside of Irrationality could also be called ""The chapters and/or parts of chapters that I forgot to include in the first book, so here's another one"". There are interesting points, of course, the writing is equally good and the use of personal examples is delicately balanced on the edge of ""courageous and endearing"" and ""is this a biography?"". However, it just seemed overall less coherent to me. I'm getting picky."
