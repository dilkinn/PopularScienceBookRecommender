0,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1504839-patricia,5,"A year or more ago, I mistakenly placed a review for Gawande's book Better under this title. I have fixed the mix up, and I have now read Complications.Gawande is pure pleasure to read. His writing is fluid and full of germane examples as he addresses big issues like error and incompetence as well as topics that seem less significant but which he makes worthy of consideration such as blushing and nausea. The headings for each section of the book--Fallibility, Mystery, and Uncertainty--are thematic in the text. As one reviewer wrote, ""Thank heaven someone wrote this book."" Gawande is unapologetic and totally direct in his appraisal of medicine. What I really appreciate is that in Better, which he wrote after Complications, he gives equal time to discussing ways in which medicine can improve. I'm a fan. A good writer and a good doc. What more could I ask for? "
1,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322306-ben-pederson,1,"This book wss filled with about 25 anecdotes flimsily tied together by Gawande's less than inspiring reflections. I have the book in front of me at the moment and I am paging through rereading sections that I noted along the way:""I had come into residency to learn how to be a surgeon. I had thought that meant simply learning the repertoire of move and techniques involved in doing an operation or making a diagnosis. In fact, there was also the new and delicate matter of talking patients through their decisions - something that sometimes entailed its own repertoire of moves and techniques."" pg 217Next to this paragraph I had written ""NO SHIT!""The book is full of these minor, pseudo-epiphianic moments that come off as weak aphorisms. However, given the audience of this book (everyone) he does well to treat people about how uncertain medicine really is and how it really comes down to the tricky nature of making decisions and how they should be made in the medical setting:""But the conundrum remains: if both doctors and patients are fallible, who should decide? We want a rule. And so we've decided that the patients should be the ultimate arbiter. But such hard and fast rule seems ill-suited both to a caring relationships between docotr and patient and to the reality of medical care, where a hunderred decisions have to be made quickly... The doctor should not make all of these decisions, and neither should the patient. Something must be worked out between then, one on one - a personal modus operandi. Where many ethicits go wrong is in promoting patient autonomy as a kind of ultimate value in medicine rather than recognizing it as one value among others...(A)s the field grows ever more complex and technological, the real task isn't to banish paternalism; the real task is to preserve kindness."" pg 223-4This simply makes sense, nothing new here.The best part of the book is the last two paragraphs (and is all you really need to read have said that you have read the book, in my opinion.):""The possibilities and probabilities are all we have to work on within medicine...What we are drawn to in this imperfect science, what we in fact covet in our way, is the alterable moment- the fragile but crystalline opportunity for one's know-how, ability, or just gut instinct to change the course of another's life for the better. In the actual situations that present themselves, however, [...] we can never be sure whether we have such a moment or not. Even less clear is whether the actions we choose will prove either wise or helpful. That our efforts succeed at all is still sometimes a chock to me. But they do. Not always, but often enough."" pg 251-2In a way, the whole thesis of this book (which I think is summed up in the sentence in bold above) is pretty remarkable. There is so much talk about the fallibility and humanity in medicine right now... fallibility is so hot right now. However, as is apparent in this book, the medical community is only at the stage of recognizing this fallibility. Gawande doesn't do what I thought he would: suggest what we should do given the increase visibility of the fallibility of the practice of medicine. He really doesn't have any good ideas. In all his articles, he seems to be advocating a technocratic answer (using checklists etc.). The biggest problem I have with the book is the way Gawande seems to view the profession medical community of independently-acting people, who, in the aggregate, are not too of an impressive lot. In this, Gawande is entirely old-school. He fails to recognize the possibility of alternative ways to approach patient care. In a way, I think that he is dangerously anecdotal. Maybe it is just me being tired of reading anecdotal medical non-fiction, but it just seems like a lame format (don't hold these words against me because I really don't know what I am looking for, or what type of book I would write). He treats them like data points. I believe that the book could be reduced by about 80% for someone like you or I who are as far in the medical field as we are. However, I believe there to be value within this book. I am really really happy that millions of people (future patients) are reading books like this and Groopman's ""How doctor's think"" as it really does educate them to get real about what medical care is all about. It will serve to empower people and get them involved in their care and think about how they want it to go down. But, to me, I really did expect a lot more from this guy. The reviews that it got are ridiculous, they are way over the top! It is pretty incredible- it goes to show how easy it is to be heard once you have written for the New Yorker and got a MD from Havard. I will keep reading his books, though, for no other reason than that he is so hot right now, millions are reading him. I at least have to know other people are thinking about. "
2,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/571596-elizabeth,5,"Complications is a book of anecdotes about a surgical resident’s experiences and impressions of the current health care environment. Gawande divides his stories into three sections: fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The fallibility section demonstrates that doctors can make mistakes. Some fallibility arises from there being a learning curve. For example, it is hard to do a central line correctly the first time. But for a doctor to learn how to do a central line, he must have a first patient to try it on. The concern then arises as to which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Yet fallibility occurs in even the most experienced doctors. Gawande reports on one doctor who became so careless that he was no longer allowed to practice. The frightening part of that story is how long his colleagues let him continue when they had concerns. (The Doctor also brings up this issue.) It is understandable that doctors are reluctant to come down too hard on their colleagues. They need each other as a support system and thus need to maintain trusting relationships. Furthermore, medicine is uncertain, and it can take a long time to see a pattern of truly irresponsible behavior as opposed to just having more complicated cases. Gawande makes the point that discipline of doctors works best when it done by a group outside the doctors peer group or employer because it is more objective. Then this outside group can propose a plan of action which the employer can implement. Unfortunately, this model has been too expensive to be much of a viable option. 	The mystery section details stories of conditions that cannot be explained by current medical science, like blushing, pain, and nausea. In each of these cases, the doctors could not explain why the patient had the condition. Much of the time, the patient just wanted the doctors to believe them even though there did not seem to be a physiological source of the problem. It is interesting that the patient is more willing to accept that there is no medical explanation than the doctors. Yet the doctors are the ones with the training and have probably seen many more circumstances when they cannot make a diagnosis. 	The uncertainty section deals with how to make the right diagnosis or judgment. There are several points in this section that have come up in the other literature reviewed for this independent study. First is the declining use of the autopsy. The autopsy is how doctors can determine what was actually wrong with the patient. It is the final way to get rid of uncertainty. Its purpose is to help the doctors recognize such conditions in the future. Yet autopsies are done less and less. (Although many times the family is opposed to the autopsy and will not allow it.) Another recurring point is the decision-making power of the patient. Patients have become more pro-active in their desire for decision-making ability, but they are much more ambivalent about actually exercising it. Especially in situations where there is uncertainty, patients do not feel comfortable or emotionally able to make the decision. Some do not think they can handle the responsibility if it turns out to be the wrong decision. Gawande notes that doctors also prefer to make the decision. One of the things he had to learn as a resident is how to persuade patients to the decision he thinks is best. As health care becomes more consumer-driven, the debate over the level of physician agency is likely to continue."
3,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,4,"I finished this book about a week ago and the next day my mom fell and f#*$*%* broke her hip. So, this is NOT the type of book to read or even think about when you have someone in the hospital.Most doctors, especially surgeons, are viewed as infallible but in reality they are just like us. They have bad days, they make mistakes and some of them should really change careers.The author writes eloquently, with compassion and a clear love for surgery, which made this a fascinating book to delve into. Most of the stories felt anecdotal rather than a deep dive into the details which for a layman like me was perfect.The author also poses a lot of ethical questions about the profession and how much patient autonomy should be allowed when making health decisions.If you have any interest in medical memoirs you should try this author at least once."
4,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016770-libby-ames,4,"Although I am interested in the medical profession, motivation to learn more about it often elludes me. Gawande was able to keep my attention and present points that I could understand in spite of my limited medical knowledge.Admittedly, some of his information scared me. After reading some points about surgery, I wondered how I ever allowed anyone to cut into me and place a plate and seven screws in my leg. Also, some of his writing made me squeemish. I had to pause or skip places that became too graphic for my weak stomach. Some of his writing discouraged me. Why am I trying to lose weight if no one is able to succesfully lose weight and keep it off unless they are dangerous and intensive surgery? I also felt discouraged over the problems he presented that really have no attainable answers.In spite of my difficulty with his unanswerable questions, I appreciated Gawande's straightforward honesty about the medical profession and its weakness. Ironically, his admission of the fallibility of doctors and medicine, makes me more willing to approach a doctor. It makes it easier for me to ask questions if I don't expect the doctor to have all the right answers (especially if that doctor is willing to admit such a possibility). "
5,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12818720-kazen,4,"4.5 starsI had a great time reading this with Heidi from My Reading Life. The book is broken up into three sections named for ideas that vex doctors - Fallibility, Mystery, and Uncertainty. He looks at the way surgeons are educated, advancements in medicine, hard to pin down diagnoses, and more with a liberal sprinkling of fascinating cases.The pacing is perfect, there are edge of your seat moments to see if a patient makes it, and he brings up ethical issues that appear in his later books, such as medical error and treatment decisions at the end of life. Those in the know will recognize that medicine has changed over the years since publication, but even so it holds up incredibly well.I kinda wish I had more to say but it's one of those books that's so good you don't need to say all that much in the first place. If you have any little interest in medical nonfiction you'll want to pick up Complications, as well as Gawande's other books, post haste."
6,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Not quite a 4 star read, but close enough. It's fairly short & does make his major points fairly well. They boil down to medicine isn't perfect.Doctors are humans, so need to learn & will make mistakes, even with the best intentions. Do I want a doctor to learn on me or mine? Hell no! Gawande admits that he doesn't either & he makes sure they don't, BUT we won't get any new ones if they don't start somewhere. So what's the solution? There isn't a good one. Deal with it.Patients are humans, so they're complicated. They do things that are bad for them & all demand the highest level of care. Since the mid-80's, they've been getting more say in what their treatment is & often they're not well equipped to do so either due to ignorance or just feeling like crap. Balance between what the doctor recommends & what the patient wants is tough.Medicine has come a LONG way in a short time, but they still don't know a lot. As it becomes more complicated, it's tougher for doctors to stay on top of even their specialty. Unspoken, but obvious in the subtext, is that it takes more people to do the job & a lot depends on every one & thing's availability & doing their job properly. Facilities are often stretched.Overall, it was an interesting tour inside the field from a young surgeon's point of view. I think this was his first book & it suffered a bit from that. It's also a bit dated in some respects having been written 15 years ago or so. Still, it's well worth reading."
7,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Practice is funny that way. For days and days, you make out only the fragments of what to do. And then one day you've got the thing whole. Conscious learning becomes unconscious knowledge, and you cannot say precisely how.”  I have always been intrigued by medicine. I know it’s a scary thought, but inevitably, illness will impact each of us in one way or another. Either we will get sick or somebody we love will get sick. Which is why learning about medicine and healthcare is so important. However, a lot of books about medicine and healthcare can be pretty dry, which is where Dr. Gawande comes to the rescue. His clear prose makes even the most difficult medical concepts easy to understand. In this book, Gawande is just starting out his medical career. Like most new graduates, Gawande is excited yet nervous about the new challenges that await him in the workplace. But he soon realizes that medical school only teaches you a tiny smudge of what being a doctor is actually about. Medicine is so much more than just a science - it is a messy and imperfect art. A lot of what doctors do is intuitive; they piece together symptoms to formulate a treatment plan. However, uncertainty feels grander in medicine because human lives are at risk. And as a doctor, you not only need book smarts, but the ability to navigate unforeseen challenges with integrity and fortitude. A lot of this book comprises of fascinating case studies: a victim who was shot in the buttock leaves the hospital virtually unharmed, a pregnant woman with nausea so debilitating that she has to leave work, a neurosurgeon who copes with severe blushing, and a young woman whose inconspicuous leg pain turns out to be a deadly infection. If you like suspense, then this book is for you. The saying  “everything can change in an instant”  is ever so applicable to medicine. Although I enjoyed this book, I thought it was a bit dull at times. I think it could have been improved if it contained a tad bit of humor. But overall, I did enjoy it. I would recommend  “Complications”  to medical professionals or anybody who is interested in learning about the healthcare field. "
8,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32853493-mckenzie-literarydragon,5,"Let’s play the “who wants to be horrified” game. Complications made it hard to sleep. Not because of gore necessarily but because it made clear to me that doctors are just people who were given a scalpel. Yes, they have a ton of education but at some point, they must get experience.In one section Gawande discusses a procedure in which he must put in a central line which goes into a major vein in your chest which can technically kill you. All he tells the patient is that he must put in a central line, not that it is dangerous or that it is his first time doing this procedure. I completely understand why he didn’t tell the patient, but that doesn’t make it any less terrifying. I have thought about how doctors have to start at some point, but it was never so clear to me that there is a first patient for every procedure for every doctor. For every surgeon, there will be the first surgery. There is a first time for cutting into the flesh of a still-living person.It was published in 2002 so I’m sure some things have changed, but it’s still current enough about how the training takes place.It’s an important realization of how much control doctors have over our bodies and how little they have over everything else in the hospital. They don’t get to choose...For the full review please visit https://www.literarydragonreviews.web..."

""Hospital lawyers warn doctors that, although they must, of course, tell patients about injuries that occur, they are never to intimate that they were at fault, lest the 'confession' wind up in court as damning evidence in a black-and-white morality tale.""""This was not guilt: guilt is what you feel when you have done something wrong. What I felt was shame: I was what was wrong. And yet I also knew that a surgeon can take such feelings too far [...] One surgeon with a national reputation told me about an abdominal operation in which he had lost control of bleeding while he was removing what turned out to be a benign tumor and the patient had died. [...] The case affected his performance for months.""""In its way, the M&M is an impressively sophisticated and human institution. Unlike the courts or the media, it recognizes that human error is generally not something that can be deterred by punishment.""So sophisticated that it doesn't include compensation for negligently injured patients! Or consequences for negligent doctors besides ~*shame*~ in the conference room! ""There are all sorts of reasons that it would be wrong to take my license away or to take me to court. Those reasons do not absolve me. Whatever the limits of the M&M, its fierce ethic of personal responsibility for errors is a formidable virtue.""Personal responsibility so long as it's a fifteen minute shaming directed at your mentor. And note that he doesn't discuss why it would be wrong to take his license away - wow, what a great look at the complexities of the situation! rme""But the problem of bad doctors isn't the problem of [frightening aberrations like James Burt, a notorious Ohio gynecologist who subjected hundreds of women, often they had been anesthetized for other procedures, to a bizarre, disfiguring operation involving clitoral circumcision and vaginal 'reshaping' which he called the Surgery of Love]. It is the problem of what you might call everyday bad doctors [...] the illustrious cardiologist who has slowly gone senile and won't retire [...]""Ahahaha, trying to treat James Burt as an isolated freak when other doctors knew what he was doing, said nothing and later refused to testify against him. Years wherein they said and did nothing about this man who was not licensed as a surgeon and was bragging about mutilating women while they were unconscious. James Burt is an illustration of the extent to which the medical community are willing to look the other way. If doctors will ignore the James Burts of the world, then how can we expect them to turn in the hypothetical illustrious but senile cardiologist? It is the same problem. Nice try though, Gawande.""Was money part of the problem?""Gawande tries to portray a surgeon who admits to booking far more patients than he could handle and rushing through their care in order to make more and more money (despite making 400k) as a poor little rich boy. Sorry, no. The question is, was greed part of the problem and the answer is yes.""There are both honorable and dishonorable reasons for [doctors finding themselves unable to do anything decisive about bad doctors] [...] The honorable reason, and probably the main reason, is that no one really has the heart for it. When a skilled, decent, ordinarily conscientious colleague, whom you've known and worked with for years, starts popping Percodans, or becomes preoccupied with personal problems, and neglects the proper care of patients, you want to help, not destroy the doctor's career.""I love that his first concern isn't the patients or even the doctor, but the doctor's career. I also love that the example bad doctor he discusses didn't end up getting the sack for ruining a 28 year old woman's life but because he didn't go to M&M conferences. Injure all the patients you like, but don't you dare thumb your nose at our rituals wherein we discuss these injuries!! And then he cries about how this poor disgraced doctor only succeeded in getting malpractice insurance after a year. Oh gosh, a whole year? How terrible for him. ""People actually prefer the world of don't ask, don't tell. Just ask yourself, could you abide by a system that rehabilitated drug-addicted anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons with manic psychosis, or a pediatrician with a thing for little girls if it meant catching more of them?""...one of these things is not like the others... and that isn't your only option. and rn, there are plenty of doctors who have been disciplined for egregiously terrible stuff and should never be allowed to practice again and yet somehow, are so what would be the difference.""Could it have been a mistaken, then, even to have told him about the surgical option? [...] People are rightly suspicious of those claiming to know better than they do what's best for them. But a good physician cannot simply stand aside when patients make bad or self-defeating decisions - decisions that go against their deepest goals. [goes into an anecdote about how a doctor convinced a woman to start her physical therapy and it was all for the best]""Yeah, because not giving a patient the full range of their surgical options is the same as encouraging a patient to do rehabilitative therapy! Definitely! Has this man done zero law in the zillion years it must have taken him to get a MPH and become a surgeon? Ok, I've parsed enough. I will say that his musings on patient autonomy are truly disgusting though (he thinks we should replace the autonomy principle with a concept of 'kindness' because paternalism is not the enemy, what the everlasting fuck) and show that he doesn't understand the concept of patient autonomy or the emergency exception doctrine (I only know about it through canadian law but I'm sure Americans must have the same thing).This was probably the most hateful thing I've read in years. Wow."
10,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26556-katie,4,"An very well written book in which Gawande argues that surgery is an evolving and imperfect art. He begins by describing in compulsively readable detail some occasions during which it has failed its patients. An overarching theme in the book is an idea of what makes a good surgeon; Gawande points out that it's not about innate talent. It's about practice, commitment, a willingless to learn new things, a willingness to teach others, specialization, and perhaps attentiveness to the patient. (I also read Blink, recently, by Malcolm Gladwell, and he points out that the number of medical malpractice lawsuits a doctor will have filed against him or her can be predicted based on the tone of voice they take with patients during their first appointments- it has almost nothing to do with malpractice and everything to do with the way the doctor made the patient feel. Regular people were asked to listen to tape recordings of appointments in which the actual words were blurred somehow and all you heard was tone. They predicted with some phenomenal degree of accuracy who would get sued.). Anyway, Gawande's ""good surgeon"" reminded me a lot of what it takes to be a good public servant of any kind, and it was a thought-provoking, at times frightening, and inspiring book."
11,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,4,"Atul Gawande writes for The New Yorker, and I always read his articles as soon as I spot the by-line. I read ""Better"" last year and think it is even, yes, better. But both books have rare qualities. Gawande is a physician who can step back from his ego and write with compassion and insight about the relationship between vulnerable sick people and those whose skill and judgment they are compelled to trust."
12,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey,2,"There was a time in my life when I looked to Reader's Digest as a more credible source of information; I even garnered some sort of feeling of being in the presence of wisdom when the correct stars were in alignment. The time when I felt such is as long ago as is the date of publication of this book, so perhaps, had I read it then, I would have liked it a great deal more. As it stands, I don't read nonfiction for the express purpose of being coddled into a feel-good view of a certain section of the world that views itself as above and beyond the influence of everyone and everything in and around it. If I did, I wouldn't have bothered to single out Gawande as hopefully a source that was somewhat free of the pale, comfortingly eugenicist meanderings that require black patients be wary of white doctors and fat patients be wary of pretty much everyone in the medical field. I didn't expect him to be an expert on the havoc that certain ideologies, probingly detailed in Medical Apartheid and other works, have wreaked and continue to wreak on the concepts of health, medicine, and healing in the United States, but it was rather pathetic to watch him fumble around seemingly mysterious patterns of occurrences that would be rather hard to parse if one didn't ever consider the state of health insurance in this country. In other cases, there was a nod towards systemic, dehumanizing biases that significantly the efforts of any well meaning doctor, but Gawande had already spent so much time normalizing the status quo that the critique seemed little more than the fine print of a drug ad. So, observations of a morally grey environment equipped with a healthy amount of cited literature? Sure. A rendering of the medical field that acknowledged ""complications"" stemming from far less good-intentioned sources? No, and it was the latter I was looking for.
The perfect test or scan may have been available, but the physicians never ordered it.
As you may be able to tell, I don't have the best relationship with the health industry. I have enough separate things wrong with me to necessitate regular visits to one or more institutions, but ever since a youth filled with borderline Munchausen By Proxy experiences and my undergrad days when my collegial institution would only give me treatment if I agreed to being experimented on by students, I don't do more than is absolutely necessary. Successive years of being in a community with my fellow neuroatypicals has given me plenty of stories of forced institutionalization, fat-shaming, racism, transphobia, and general abuse that was often only marginally lessened by rigorous research on the patient's side. I didn't expect Gawande to be all doom and gloom, but there was a pattern of pointing out fat patients as particularly difficult to operate on that wasn't much alleviated by a later article that all but swore by gastric bypass surgery. I could go into experiments that found rats became drug addicts when not offered enough positive stimulation and generally good environments, the all but 100% monetization of public spheres, the nearly ubiquitous inhumane conditions of workplaces that refuse all semblance of a healthy amount of sitting, standing, and general movement, but I won't. All I'll say is, there are a number of times when my teeth cleaner, aware of my pretty optimal dental status and less than optimal financial means, has offered to let me skip the MD's visit and spend half what I would have otherwise, and I can't think of a time when I refused the offer. So, that perfect scan or test? Doesn't mean jack squat if it's a choice between that and rent.I got some bits and pieces out of this, which is why this is a two star for the moment. Still, the obscenely high rating for a work that phrases increased rights for disabled people leading to more people being publicly disabled as a bad thing is little more than nonfiction that falls right in line with filth such as 'Me Before You'. It would've been a surprise had I viewed phrases such as ""Harvard Medical School"" and ""The New Yorker"" as having any measure of inherent credibility, but I knew plenty of pre-meds back in my BioE days at UCLA, and they were only ever in it for the money. Abusive (male) doctors mutilating, if not outright murdering, tens to hundreds of patients because their staff were too wibbly wobbly/genuinely afraid of retaliation to do anything about it, weight considered purely in terms of what is ingested and nothing else, egotistical rolls of the dice being favored over a scientific approach just so a single fallible individual can feel like a hero every once in a while: give me a break. The medical field truly is a complicated one, but I came to this piece expecting to be able to read up on some sort of MRI procedure (something which is, fun fact, I can't have myself due to my ink), not a fancier rendition of toothbrush and toothpaste. Now, I don't read a lot of this type of nonfiction, so this review may be suffering a tad from overdue-vent-itis. However, it's not like the evidence isn't there, so I'm fine with leaving it like this for now."

Awe-inspiring tales by a surgeon who wields his pen as he does his scalpel. A must read for every medical student, or anyone within the medical field. This book cemented my passion for surgery, and made my decision to be a surgeon a vivid one. It eradicated the notion I had about a profession centered around an innate talent and good manual dexterity; as I learned what it takes to be a surgeon is much more than that."
16,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123581-valerie-kyriosity,4,"Fascinating. I only wish Gawande brought a biblical worldview into the topic. It was the missing dimension in many stories—What role does human depravity play here? How could prayer make a difference there? What if we applied basic principles of wisdom in this case? What if the gospel were presented in that one? Man is so complex—body, mind, and spirit so inextricably intertwined—that we're never going to understand the complexities of any one of them without bringing our knowledge of the others to bear. Someday we'll get there. "

Now, Using the latest method, a child who has born with ""great artery transposition"" can reach the age of 40. But, when its was first introduced, the safety rate was really low. (i forget about its number.. hmm 8 survivals against 100 operations? sorry, i forget the number)Then, surgeons keep practicing, keep using the latest method, do a preparation surgery, training the nurse, using a team who spesialized on its procedure, maintain the team.. then.. the safety rate increase. Like i said before, these days, a child with ""great transposition artery"" can celebrate his or her 40's birthday..It means, we can never resist a failure. A medical student can never resist a failure..Too bad, people dont care about it. A simple or even hard failure of a medical student (physicians is a life-long medical students, right?), is a condition that makes them an expert someday. But, people dont care.. they never careHaah.. tiba2 gue kepikiran soal pendidikan di kampus gue.. = |Oya, buku ini salah satu favorit gue (biarpun cuma 3-bintang) karena punya ""kenangan"" tersendiri. ^_^ huehehe..."
20,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166992-jessika,3,"This book only got three stars from me mostly because even though I enjoyed it as I was reading, I didn't love it as much as I thought I was going to. I think the thing I liked the most about Complications was that it was really thought-provoking. Gawande does an excellent job at poking and prodding your mind to get you to think about the answers to questions that don't necessarily have a right or wrong answer. For as much as we all seem to think that medicine is this black and white area of life--it isn't. Even today, with all of the technological advances and machinery that we have, there are still many unresolved issues in the field of medicine. For example, we expect our doctors to be as knowledgeable and efficient as machines, but as Gawande points out, many decisions (even some life-saving ones) come to fruition as nothing more than hunches. So, to me, thinking about all of the issues that he brought up was probably my favorite part of this book. The medical cases were certainly interesting, too, but I admit, I went into this expecting something out of Grey's Anatomy--like these freak cases that would blow me away like a live bomb in someone's abdomen or something. To that extent, it was my own fault that I didn't enjoy the medical cases as much as I could have. Although, I will say, the necrotizing fasciitis case was pretty cool! Gawande is a skilled writer, too, as I alluded to earlier. If he weren't a surgeon, he would definitely be able to take up writing as a career option! Something about the way that he wrote about these issues was what really got me thinking about them. He's a very intelligent man, and it comes off in his writing--not in an arrogant way, though. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this book, which is saying something considering that I'm not a big non-fiction fan. I wish I would have loved it, but it was a pleasurable read while it lasted. I would recommend this to those with any interesting in the medical field or even just those looking for an interesting non-fiction read. "
21,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10507936-fares,4,"This was probably the best book I have read for Atul Gawande yet. Atul has a great way of laying out his ideas and experience through story-telling. He takes the reader into journeys around a particular topic very smoothly and in an enjoyable way.He's got a nice approach to writing. He starts with an interesting introduction on something he wants to discuss and shed light on, lays down the background and fundamentals, without neglecting to convey across any intricacies involved. This often has to do with a patient he had seen or had been exposed to his/her situation; a very humanizing approach that catches the reader's attention and feelings.He then moves on to put this problem in perspective technical, historical, ... etc, putting it in context. Then goes back to the patient, the human factor, and finishes off the story, often, with satisfying closure.This is a great book of his. I particularly liked the last chapter, on ""Uncertainty""."
22,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8035193-sarah,5,"Wow! I loved this and I love Dr. Gawande. The first section is about how it is necessary for medical residents to learn how to do procedures on people, but how it's just as necessary to sort of glide over that fact with patients. This was the most exciting part of the book because he went over his own early surgeries and the complications that arose. The rest of the book is about how, even though medicine is a 'scientific' field, it's ultimately human and fallible. My anxiety was high during most of this, because being a doctor is so high pressure! It was a rollercoaster ride because I kept changing my mind. For a while, I'd think, ""Oh, I guess you should never have surgery unless it's absolutely necessary,"" but then a while later, I'd think, ""Oh shit! Just have the biopsy! Don't be ridiculous!!!!"" I loved this. I can't wait to read ""Better.""Sarah Montambo Powell"

Gawande is a surgical resident (when he wrote it), a thinker and a poet. He uses case histories to explore the thinking, the philosophy, of medicine. He speaks of mistakes and intuition, luck and skill, good outcomes despite bad treatement, and devastating outcomes despite excellent care. This should be required reading for all medical students and regularly re-read by all MDs.After I'd read it I couldn't stop talking about it, and convinced one of my F2F book clubs to read it in July 2005.

I was able to read it while sitting beside my husband on a beautiful beach in Mexico. Totally relaxed and without interruptions I was able to pepper him with frequent questions. ""What do you think about this? Does he accurately portray residency? What about surgery?"" and on and on. I learned so much about medicine and even more about my husband. "
25,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20434984-david-bjelland,3,"A book full of valuable observations and statistics for a reader like myself with pretty much no knowledge about the American medical system that hasn't been gleaned from dramatizations of it on TV or conversations around the politics of it, but at times frustrating in its ""pop""-ness, coming across as either patronizing or amateurish. For one, Gawande has a bad case of the ""It was a crisp, sunny day in Autumn when...""s - such rushed, bland scene-setting for the OR anecdotes makes you wish he'd employ his own experiences more as plain old illustrative examples for his thesis rather than attempts to build the empathy and tension of a medical drama. Also, as other reviews have pointed out, he tends to wrap 101-level assessments in the lofty language of the hard-won epiphany. Maybe for some readers, this enhances the sense that they're reading something important and self-improving, but personally it just made me feel coddled. ""This is all stuff I should already know about the medical system as an informed citizen,"" I want to tell Dr. Gawande. ""Please do not reward my ego with these rich, chocolatey brownie points for making the effort."" Anyway, glad to have read this nonetheless!"

There were, however, parts where he just went on ranting, losing his train of thought in what seemed to me like an attempt to justify his or his colleagues' calls in some of the cases. I loved how Gawande went about showing us the weak and uncertain side of part of his medical career, choosing cases where his judgment and performance weren't as perfect as everyone expects from a doctor, and a surgeon in particular.

Author has walked us through some of the strange cases, how some tough decisions were made, and how it made a difference. There is a debate on how to train new people and increase their experince, while the preference is to provide the best possible (most experienced) medical care to each and every patient.Some of the latter parts felt a bit dry. There were essays on pain, nausea, blushing red, and a fat man who couldnt stop eating. Couldn't connect much with those."

There is a broad look into the practical, ethical, and philosophical decisions the surgeons make day-to-day. It is a fascinating peek into the lives of Doctors. The writing is fresh and uncluttered, a pleasure to read. I would definitely read more books by this author.Highly recommend this book to all my friends."
29,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"A fascinating and disturbing look into the fallibility of medical expertise and the very human uncertainties faced by even the most skilled and well meaning of doctors. Don’t read this one before facing a major medical procedure. Or if you’re squeamish. (One member of my family had to leave the room whenever I was listening to this on Audible.) But definitely do read it if you have an interest in the challenges of the medical profession. My oldest son is hoping to become a doctor someday, and a friend in med school recommended this to him, so we’ve been listening to it together. Not as well written—or as focused on the bigger ethical dilemmas—as Gawande’s books  Better and Being Mortal , but still informative and engaging. "
30,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
31,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
32,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book. Like The Hot Zone and Being Mortal, it offers in-depth insights into the darkest areas of medical science. "

We think of medicine as being about science, but it’s really about the humans who administer that science in imperfect ways. These fallible humans are tasked with making decisions in the face of great uncertainty and often a gaping lack of knowledge. That’s what this book was about."

41,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
42,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
43,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
44,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
45,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"

Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "

If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
48,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."

I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "

Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
51,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
52,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
53,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."
54,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10735476-mar-lia-bonelli,4," Scary for how true it is in the simplest ways. Doctors are human beings, we know that. But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""
55,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"Wow - this book was so great. I'm sad that it's over! It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
56,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
57,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
58,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
59,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
60,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
61,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
62,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

The text toggles between the philosophical issues of decision-making and intuition in the medical field, and countless anecdotes of real patients Gawande has encountered during his years of residency. If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book. Like The Hot Zone and Being Mortal, it offers in-depth insights into the darkest areas of medical science. "

We think of medicine as being about science, but it’s really about the humans who administer that science in imperfect ways. These fallible humans are tasked with making decisions in the face of great uncertainty and often a gaping lack of knowledge. That’s what this book was about."

70,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58567012-ann-marie,4,I have always been fascinated by medical mysteries and the process by which doctors reach diagnostic conclusions. Atul Gawande does a wonderful job of telling the story of his experience with this aspect of science in terms an intelligent layman can easily understand.
71,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
72,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
73,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
74,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
75,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"
76,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70649103-aagami1012,3,"This book was not bad. However, it was by no means great. Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "
77,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10091631-john-woltjer,5,"Every so often, someone writes a book from the ""inside"" of a profession that reveals its deepest darkest secrets, its vulnerabilities, the truth behind the facade. If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
78,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."

I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
80,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
81,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
82,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
83,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."
84,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10735476-mar-lia-bonelli,4," Scary for how true it is in the simplest ways. Doctors are human beings, we know that. But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""
85,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"Wow - this book was so great. I'm sad that it's over! It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
86,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
87,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
88,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
89,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
90,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
91,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
92,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book. Like The Hot Zone and Being Mortal, it offers in-depth insights into the darkest areas of medical science. "

We think of medicine as being about science, but it’s really about the humans who administer that science in imperfect ways. These fallible humans are tasked with making decisions in the face of great uncertainty and often a gaping lack of knowledge. That’s what this book was about."

101,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
102,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
103,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
104,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
105,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"
106,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70649103-aagami1012,3,"This book was not bad. However, it was by no means great. Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "
107,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10091631-john-woltjer,5,"Every so often, someone writes a book from the ""inside"" of a profession that reveals its deepest darkest secrets, its vulnerabilities, the truth behind the facade. If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
108,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."

I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
110,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
111,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
112,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
113,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."
114,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10735476-mar-lia-bonelli,4," Scary for how true it is in the simplest ways. Doctors are human beings, we know that. But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""
115,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"Wow - this book was so great. I'm sad that it's over! It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
116,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
117,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
118,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
119,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
120,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
121,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
122,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

The text toggles between the philosophical issues of decision-making and intuition in the medical field, and countless anecdotes of real patients Gawande has encountered during his years of residency. If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book. Like The Hot Zone and Being Mortal, it offers in-depth insights into the darkest areas of medical science. "

We think of medicine as being about science, but it’s really about the humans who administer that science in imperfect ways. These fallible humans are tasked with making decisions in the face of great uncertainty and often a gaping lack of knowledge. That’s what this book was about."

131,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
132,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
133,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
134,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
135,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"
136,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70649103-aagami1012,3,"This book was not bad. However, it was by no means great. Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "

If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
138,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."
139,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963387-mariam-394,4,"First book of its kind that I read.. Interesting and did not regret reading it. I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
140,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
141,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
142,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
143,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."
144,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10735476-mar-lia-bonelli,4," Scary for how true it is in the simplest ways. Doctors are human beings, we know that. But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""
145,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"Wow - this book was so great. I'm sad that it's over! It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
146,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
147,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
148,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
149,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
150,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
151,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
152,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book. Like The Hot Zone and Being Mortal, it offers in-depth insights into the darkest areas of medical science. "

We think of medicine as being about science, but it’s really about the humans who administer that science in imperfect ways. These fallible humans are tasked with making decisions in the face of great uncertainty and often a gaping lack of knowledge. That’s what this book was about."

161,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
162,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
163,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
164,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
165,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"

Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "
167,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10091631-john-woltjer,5,"Every so often, someone writes a book from the ""inside"" of a profession that reveals its deepest darkest secrets, its vulnerabilities, the truth behind the facade. If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
168,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."

I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
170,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "

It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
172,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
173,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."

But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""

It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
176,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
177,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
178,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
179,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
180,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
181,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
182,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book.

191,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
192,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
193,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
194,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
195,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"

Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre.

If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
198,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."
199,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963387-mariam-394,4,"First book of its kind that I read.. Interesting and did not regret reading it. I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
200,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
201,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
202,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
203,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."
204,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10735476-mar-lia-bonelli,4," Scary for how true it is in the simplest ways. Doctors are human beings, we know that. But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""
205,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"Wow - this book was so great. I'm sad that it's over! It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
206,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
207,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
208,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
209,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
210,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
211,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
212,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

The text toggles between the philosophical issues of decision-making and intuition in the medical field, and countless anecdotes of real patients Gawande has encountered during his years of residency. If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book. Like The Hot Zone and Being Mortal, it offers in-depth insights into the darkest areas of medical science. "
216,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38648194-faye-zheng,4,"Picked this up at the free little library, because I really admired Gawande’s writing in his most recent book Being Mortal. We think of medicine as being about science, but it’s really about the humans who administer that science in imperfect ways. These fallible humans are tasked with making decisions in the face of great uncertainty and often a gaping lack of knowledge. That’s what this book was about."

220,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58567012-ann-marie,4,I have always been fascinated by medical mysteries and the process by which doctors reach diagnostic conclusions.

221,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
222,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
223,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
224,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
225,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"
226,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70649103-aagami1012,3,"This book was not bad. However, it was by no means great. Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "
227,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10091631-john-woltjer,5,"Every so often, someone writes a book from the ""inside"" of a profession that reveals its deepest darkest secrets, its vulnerabilities, the truth behind the facade. If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
228,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."
229,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963387-mariam-394,4,"First book of its kind that I read.. Interesting and did not regret reading it. I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
230,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
231,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
232,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
233,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."
234,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10735476-mar-lia-bonelli,4," Scary for how true it is in the simplest ways. Doctors are human beings, we know that. But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""
235,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"Wow - this book was so great. I'm sad that it's over! It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
236,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
237,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
238,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
239,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
240,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
241,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
242,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

The text toggles between the philosophical issues of decision-making and intuition in the medical field, and countless anecdotes of real patients Gawande has encountered during his years of residency. If you are not easily repulsed by stories of gastric-bypass surgery, screws embedded in people's feet, and flesh-eating bacteria, I would highly recommend this book. Like The Hot Zone and Being Mortal, it offers in-depth insights into the darkest areas of medical science. "

We think of medicine as being about science, but it’s really about the humans who administer that science in imperfect ways. These fallible humans are tasked with making decisions in the face of great uncertainty and often a gaping lack of knowledge. That’s what this book was about."

251,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
252,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
253,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
254,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
255,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"

I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "
257,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10091631-john-woltjer,5,"Every so often, someone writes a book from the ""inside"" of a profession that reveals its deepest darkest secrets, its vulnerabilities, the truth behind the facade. If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
258,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."
259,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963387-mariam-394,4,"First book of its kind that I read.. Interesting and did not regret reading it. I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
260,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
261,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
262,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
263,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."

But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""

It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
266,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
267,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
268,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
269,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
270,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11591966-ellen,4,"I think my main take-away from this book of essays by the gifted Dr. Atul Gawande is that medicine is not an exact science and surgeons, or doctors in general, are human and not infallible. I never thought of doctors as God but they were certainly high on a stack of pedestals. Gawande shows how disparate the decisions of treatment can be among any given group of doctors. It actually seems a bit frightening to me in that there is not one specific answer that will always fit the criteria for any one case. Of course, most attacks of appendicitis are exactly that and are treated the same. But sometimes it is not appendicitis even with all the expected symptoms present. What then? A good example in the book is the last patient discussed: a young woman presenting with an obvious case of cellulitis. Something niggling in the back of Gawande's mind suggested this was so much more. Could it be necrotizing fasciitis, ""flesh-eating disease""? Even with biopsy it still looked like the highly treatable cellulitis but several doctors had the same uneasy feeling and, upon surgery, the leg was almost completely taken over by the deadly bacteria. The young woman's leg was spared as was her very life. Where does that unease come from; and thank goodness it does! The case studies in this book are fascinating and, no, not all of them have such dramatically happy endings. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking."
271,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,5,"I loved this book. The thesis is simple: Medicine is an incomplete, uncertain, mind-bogglingly complex science. But there's also a fair amount of ""Doctors are people, too"" and not in the ""cut us some slack"" sense, but in the ""everybody makes mistakes"" sense. If you have an infallible faith in doctors and medicine, read this book. If you think doctors are just regular Joes who don't know much more than the rest of us, read this book. If you're like me and you just like to read about medical stuff, read this book!Gawande fills 268 pages with just the right balance of anecdote, personal opinion, and references to documented research. His writing is perfectly clear, concise, and never condescending. He seems to be not only a well-qualified writer, but also a brilliant doctor. I may be a bit giddy with admiration at the moment, but I'm not gonna lie: Atul Gawande is my new hero. I just bought his other book, Better, today, before even finishing this one."
272,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64987691-amber-scaife,3,"Gawande, a surgeon, argues that medicine isn't an exact science and therefore mistakes are inevitable. He then explores the line between that potential for error and the humanity necessary to make doctors good at what they do.This is a good, interesting read with all sorts of worthy insights, and Gawande is an excellent writer. My only issue with it is that I have Surgery/Hospital Fear, and his anecdotes supporting the message of medicine as not infallible really didn't help that. It's, of course, my own shortcoming and not the book's, and I can otherwise happily recommend it. "

281,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869437-gary,5,"An excellent peek behind the scenes of the surgery field when Gawande was a resident. He uses a good mix of anecdotes and research to speak about each topic. The bottom line and conclusion he comes to is that at the end of the day, there's just as many questions as there are answers in modern medicine. I found the discussion of the never ending battle of a doctor to go with gut instinct or second guess himself when lives are on the line. He did not shy to give personal anecdotes and feelings when he was on the other side of the fence particularly when his children needed medical care.I really enjoyed the writing style as well and he had a flair for describing people which helped paint a picture of each anecdote almost like a play or movie scene. Despite being a doctor, the patients were obviously at the center of each story and ultimately their feelings and decisions shaped the outcome. As this was written about 15 year ago, it will be interesting to read his letter works and thoughts on medicine."
282,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,4,"Recently I had to see a doctor for something that was bothering me. I went to my normal family physicians group, who referred me to a gastroenterologist, and eventually had to have a couple procedures in the hospital before I was offhandedly diagnosed with IBS. I say ""offhandedly"" because that's what it was: the gastroenterologist at first said I seemed to have had some kind of stomach bug that threw me out of whack, and then, when I asked further, finally said ""Yeah, I think you have IBS."" He didn't tell me what kind of foods I might try avoiding, only to take a probiotic every day, and didn't give me much more information. I walked out of his office feeling a little confused. The doctor seemed almost dismissive of everything I had explained to him even though he was willing to do tests in the hospital. So when I read this book, I kept thinking of that office visit, which was rather unlike other visits I have had with other doctors, who have always seemed willing to listen and be open. By the end of the book I was kind of wishing that Atul Gawande (or any of the other good doctors mentioned in the book) were my doc. I enjoyed Dr. Gawande's openness and his very thoughtful approach to medicine. So often doctors are looked upon as omniscient beings with the whole of medical science at their fingertips, but Gawande blasts away this notion and effectively conveys that they are just as human as the rest of us.A few things bothered me about the book: at times Gawande seems almost too thoughtful, making him seem hesitant and ineffectual; many of his stories are from him just starting out, which may have contributed to this impression. Also, he seemed at times a bit reserved from the patient themselves, reporting simply the facts and very little emotion. It seemed at odds with the way he made sure to follow up with many of his surgical patients at their homes, and the way he still remembers such specifics years later. Perhaps some of the emotional writing would have gotten in the way of the story, but it was hard for me to see the patients beyond simply what was wrong with them.I was surprised to see that this book was published in 2002. A few things about it seemed somewhat dated. I would have pegged it at 1995 or thereabouts.All in all, a solid book. I enjoyed it even if I didn't get much insight into why my gastroenterologist was so rushed (unless he's like the surgeon in the book who works 80 hours a week to pull in a $400k income and seems surprised when he gets burned out). But I certainly learned a lot about the way hospitals work and the way doctors think."
283,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38960595-ben-gosnell,4,"Do you have what it takes to perform tasks you have never completed before on a person whose life is at risk while working relentless hours? Complications is a book of anecdotes about Atul Gawande’s, a surgical resident, viewpoints and experiences regarded the current health care setting. His stories include instances of fallibility, mystery, and uncertainty. The section about fallibility explains that doctors do make mistakes. The issue with the education of doctors comes when the doctor is asked to perform a task for the first time. More often than not this task is hard to complete correctly for the first time. Controversy enters the scene when it needs to be decided which patients receive care from the inexperienced versus the experienced. Mystery comes into play when the symptoms or conditions have not yet been explained by current medical sciences and research. This results in the inability to reach a diagnosis. His last section of the book is uncertainty. This part discusses how to reach the right diagnosis or decision. Uncertainty is a big issue when many disorders and diseases have similar symptoms making it hard to reach the correct diagnosis. It is also a problem when there is more than one option making it hard to decide which one is the best for the patient and/or family. To me the lesson in this book was sometimes you need to learn from experience. I wanted to read this book because it deals with the medical field. The medical field is important to me as both of my parents are physicians. I can relate to Atul because as with the medical field life has a lot of uncertainty and decisions to be made. This book lived up to the expectations of having intriguing real-life encounters. People should read this book because it has an interesting take on how surgeons learn. Though this book is meant for those with experience within the medical field, I believe those with little experience in the field would enjoy it. "
284,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"Complications deals with the mysteries and uncertanties of medicine, beginning with a reminder that doctors are (like the rest of us) fallible humans, and ones who often have to pretend they know more than they really do. He brings up difficult questions, like the quandary of giving a patient full disclosure (""Hi, I'm Dr. Gawande, and this is the first time I've ever performed this complicated surgery. But don't worry! The other doctor in the room has done it plenty of times and will be here to take over if I start botching things too badly!"") or accepting that new doctors will never learn how to perform complicated surgeries if someone isn't their first time. Dr. Gawande's purpose in writing this book was certainly not to glorify doctors, but it was also not to belittle them in any way. He seems awed at the power given to doctors, and the way that doctors are routinely forced to make difficult decisions from inconclusive evidence. He notes that there is rarely a problem of good doctors vs. bad doctors, but more that every doctor has ""on"" moments and ""off"" moments - what time of day it is, how busy the shift has been, what sorts of patients s/he's seen that day, etc., etc., etc. Even the best of doctors make mistakes. (He provides examples from his own career as well as from others'.)I've been skeptical of medicine for a long time, and I must admit this book didn't make me any more excited or reassured about the prospect of ever ending up on an operating table. I have quite a bit to think about, but most of what I'm taking from this book is more anecdotal than informative. It's a worthwhile read, and gives insight on what it's like to be on the other side of the doctor's table, but isn't focused or thesis-driven enough to leave the reader with any new revelations or convictions. "
285,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,4,"This is a fascinating book by a physician and a great writer. Using real life cases as the focus of the book, he uses the examples and outcomes to discuss many complications in medicine. Not necessarily medical or surgical complications, but philosophical complications. He asks many thought-provoking questions emerging from his experiences. Who should make decisions regarding treatment, for example. Should the knowledgeable party-the doctor-make decisions alone? This is considered paternalistic and often problematic. Should the patient decide? After all, it's his/her body.The best decision making should involve both. However, in real life this is not always possible, as he shows in several vignettes. Is the patient mentally competent to make decisions? They should be informed of their options in clear language. They should work with the physician to decide on treatment. But the patient may have undisclosed issues, the information provided may be biased or incomplete. There may be emergency situations in which the doctor must make the decision. And with all of this, both patient and physician are humans and are fallible. Mistakes are made. There are cost-benefit issues, family members at odds with the patients wishes.Throughout the book, the record of his experiences, he is honest and human. Always aware of the enormous responsibility of his role, aware of errors of judgment, he remains a compassionate voice.Some subjects included are the complexity of pain and how it can vary from patient to patient and be present when there is no physiological reason for it. He discusses the connection between pain and the brain. There is an interesting section on hyperemesis of pregnancy, unrelenting blushing, morbid obesity and other pertinent topics. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is ill, for physicians and humans in general!"
286,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70649103-aagami1012,3,"This book was not bad. However, it was by no means great. Many of the goodreads reviews of this book mention how interesting the stories that Gawande shared were. I agree that they were interesting stories, but I also agree with reviewers that have complained about the formatting. This book is lacking when it comes to having a good flow. It is simply a collection of stories combined into one book with little separation between stories. Had the different anecdotes been tied together with better transitions, then perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more. However, while reading this book, I found that I did not want to keep reading it. Because there was a lack of flow, I was entirely uninterested in what would happen next. This is unfortunate considering medicine is such an interesting subject, and I was looking forward to reading this book. The interesting stories and the poor formatting make it difficult for me to rate this book. The stories themselves were so intriguing, but when they were all clashed together they lost some of their impressiveness. Many of the goodreads reviews were very positive. I cannot exactly disagree with them, considering that this book provides a glimpse into the medical field’s view. The primary, and pretty much the only reason I did not love this book was the formatting. I feel that if the way that the stories were placed together was tweaked a bit, it could have been a whole lot better. Different formatting would have made the book more of a page turner, and it would probably have made me actually want to continue to read it. Since the stories were so interesting, but I really did not like the formatting, I can only say this book was mediocre. However, I think that it definitely has the potential to be a great book to someone who does not mind the formatting. "
287,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10091631-john-woltjer,5,"Every so often, someone writes a book from the ""inside"" of a profession that reveals its deepest darkest secrets, its vulnerabilities, the truth behind the facade. If well done, they reveal to us that they are institutions of mere human beings who, at some level are just like the rest of us: clay footed at times, fallible, vulnerable, etc. Such is this book by Atul Gawande--a very intimate, honest, revealing book about the world of the surgeon and those who surround them. At times a bit chilling (I know that if i ever go in for surgery, I will be an informed and engaged patient as a result of this book) when he discusses the many errors made by virtually every one in the profession, and what is at the root of so many of the errors. We like to think of the body as a machine, but it is a maddeningly complex one--performing a hernia on 5 different people can be a very different experience each time. He discusses the remarkable improvements made in surgeries when machines are allowed, in some instances to make diagnoses--doctors' diagnoses are often very fallible because they bring their own subjective and limiting views to each case that can miss some very obvious factors that diagnostic computers don't make. He looks at general surgeons and their propensity to make mistakes when performing a wide array of surgeries and discusses a hospital that does only hernia operations--their error rates are considerably lower than any other hospital because the surgeons there have the mission of perfecting that particular procedure. I am reading a section now dealing with anesthesiology, a branch of the medical profession with its own troubling record of errors. A very engaging and informative book--very well written!"
288,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo,4,"I'm not sure if ""liked"" is the correct word, but it was fascinating - and somewhat disturbingthough there were positive aspect as well. It is a series of anecdotes by a resident doctor at a teaching hospital that illustrate how complicated medicine is, and the learning curve involved - a lifetime learning curve. It was sometimes hard to listen to for me sometimes. The first anecdote involved learning to put in a central line, which is learned by doing, on a patient, and when he described scraping the needle along the clavical instead of slipping under it, I just cringed. That's what happened to me when they tried to put in a central line. They had to do it twice and the second time it scraped down & under & in. And though I was on demerol for other pain, let me tell you, it hurt! But I would do it again in a heartbeat because it saved me all those needle sticks for taking out (for testing) & putting in (intravenous meds & food). That's the thing about medicine. It's an imperfect science which is learned and improved as it goes along, in many ways. Many times it does work, though other times it doesn't & other times something that should woork just goes wrong. The book is as much about the patients as the doctors, which is good. It might be easier to read/listen to if I hadn't spent so much of the last three years so involved in the intersection of the practice of medicine and my life, but it is a book all patients should read (maybe before they become patients)."
289,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963387-mariam-394,4,"First book of its kind that I read.. Interesting and did not regret reading it. I consider it a new different perspective to look at the medical fields, surgery in particular. The process of the decision making has been described perfectly ! It is not about how to do surgery, it is when to do it.. Most of the time, you make a judgment based on your feelings, and is hard to describe how you reached such diagnosis or conclusion.""Judgment is rarely a calculated weighing of all opinions, which are not good anyway, but instead an unconscious form of pattern recognition"" I loved the cases involved, especially when it gets complicated with ethical problems.. It is not easy dealing with patients, right of autonomy or confidentiality. It is too complicated, and depend on who you are, how you work, where you are !! It showed me that even the best of us makes mistakes. the ""when good doctors go bad"" is quite scary or something that make you think about yourself. One comment though, it discussed some cases in too much details. Like the one with the gastric-bypass surgery. The author kept going on and on about the same issue ! Overall, I loved it. I can see that I understand the book more if I had some background info about the cases.meaning, I loved the ethical case because we just had them at school and finished discussing the major problems, like the autonomy, or the ventilation part. I recommend the book, you shall all read it ! "
290,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9490815-xuan,4,"This is more like a summary for my record rather than a review. ---Spoiler Alert---Surgery is truly an art of uncertainty. While you learn through practice, no surgeons can ever be 100% sure of what they are doing. Surgery teamwork, resilience, and ""I do not know"". 1. Teamwork: A good surgery team doesn't necessarily need to have much experience (the members in the book are about 2 years in their residency at the start) but they stay with each other for a long time and learn together. 2. Resilience: Doctors have high suicide rate. Their mental health is affected by the long hours, the amount of knowledge, the loneliness, and the pressure from the patients and society. They are also more likely to abuse themselves, given the easy access to prescription drugs. What's uncommon is the availability of psychoanalytical treatment for doctors. They are humans too. They should be encouraged/ mandated to take necessary measures for their mental health.3. ""I do not know"": Knowledge is limitless. However, doctors rarely say ""I do not know"" because if even doctors don't know, then how can the patients ever know what's wrong with them? Gawande discussed three cases: the broadcaster woman who always blushes, the man with the never-full gut, and the complicated cellulitis case. This book is informative, and well-written (language wise). I would prefer a smoother transition between chapters and ideas to keep me hooked. "
291,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35038563-amber-alerta,4,"Complications is a book O rate as 4 stars. It really delved into the world of surgery, yet I was still able to understand a majority of the topics he elaborated on. It is divided into three sections Fallibility, Mystery and Uncertainty. The first section, Fallibility, I would rate as four stars. It is personal, honest and very scary look at Gawande’s life and observations as a surgical resident. He talks about how despite a surgeon’s public face of knowing exactly what they are doing they are often basically practicing on their patients. Even experienced surgeons are constantly faced with new technologies and procedures that they are given limited training for until they have to give it a try on their own on a living, breathing person. The second section, Mystery, I would give three stars to. In this section Gawande discusses several medical cases that are interesting and obviously interest him but which he had either no or only peripheral personal experience with. He does do excellent research on these cases and he conducted in-depth interviews with the doctors and patients for each case but they still lack the personal feel of the other two sections. The last section, Uncertainty, I would rate at almost four stars. In this section Gawande once again goes back to his own experiences while talking about autopsies and how doctors make diagnoses and how they get them wrong."
292,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116505-vaidya,5,"It was kind of unsettling reading stories of illnesses and the way doctors deal with them. The sheer fallibility of them, the different things that can go wrong, which aren't in anyone's control. Scary!The main point Dr. Gawande wants to drive home is this - ""Doctors are human. Any factors that affect success/failures of people in other professions, affect them also."" And there are a myriad other things here, like how updated the doctor is, what stage of his career he is, if she's dealing with depression, etc.I was a big fan of Scrubs, the TV show. A friend who knew a resident had said that it's as close as possible to how things run IRL. It was hard to believe. Reading this book gives you a clearer idea. And yes, my friend was right! There is one chapter which talks about patient autonomy and their right to choose the treatment they want, even the right to say no. This seems to have formed the basis for his most recent book - Being Mortal.I many ways, it is good there are ""writer-doctors"" like Gawande and Siddhartha Mukherjee. There's so much that has stayed under wraps and has been Greek-Latin for the layman. Books like this which bring out the inner workings in a way people can understand and relate to are needed a lot more. Hopefully it's a trend they've set which more doctors will embrace willingly."
293,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer,4,"through anecdotes and examples of patient cases, gawande seems to be honestly writing about fallibility - in medicine, in doctors, in patients. i don't know, so much, that the science is imperfect, but people are imperfect. i like that gawande is putting this information out for public consumption. his writing is fairly simple and accessible. as with Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, he touches on subjects that people either avoid discussing altogether, or are extremely uncomfortable talking about. but i do think there has been a shift in recent years from doctors being viewed as gods - therefore always right and never to be questioned/challenged - to patients being more involved in their own care. but there are still areas that could use improvement, and this is why i haven't rated the book 5-stars: i thought gawande would offer up ideas for how to advance the healthcare systems and doctor-patient relationships in better and more helpful ways. i also thought the book would offer a more cohesive hypothesis, with a conclusion that pulled everything together. thought that didn't happen, i did really enjoy each essay in the book, and found it all fascinating."
294,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10735476-mar-lia-bonelli,4," Scary for how true it is in the simplest ways. Doctors are human beings, we know that. But we also forget how human sometimes. This is not the type of book I read or even gravitate towards. My professor got it as a gift and lent it to me. I read a random paragraph and immediately liked it.   If you're scared of doctors, don't read this. :) If you are a doctor or anything involved with the profession, or even if you're a veterinarian, like me, read it, you'll probably see yourself or your colleagues at one point or another... We all need a mirror sometimes, and we all need to see we're not alone in what we feel and experience...""Three decades of neuropsychology research have shown us numerous ways in which the human judgement, like memory and hearing, is prone to systematic mistakes. The mind overestimates vivid dangers, falls into ruts, and manages multiple pieces of data poorly. It is swayed unduly by desire and emotion and even the time of day. It is affected by the order in which information is presented and how problems are framed. And if we doctors believed that, with all our training and experience, we escape such fallibilities, the notion was dashed when researchers put us under the microscope."""
295,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"Wow - this book was so great. I'm sad that it's over! It is basically a collection of stories as told by Dr. Gawande - stories that he has collected from his time in surgical residency. He discusses mistakes that doctors make in medicine, a collection of hard-to-solve cases, and medical uncertainty. This is among the first medical-related books that I have ever read, which helped to add to the intrigue and absolute fascination. Some of my favorite parts were his discussion on inexplicable chronic pain and also uncontrollable, debilitating blushing. I also loved his musing on patient autonomy in which he dissected (hehe, get it. he's a surgeon) the problems that a doctor faces when having to make a decision for his patient. Sometimes, patients will refuse a certain treatment - it was interesting to see how he navigates that. Also there is a section on a horrible flesh-eating bacteria that usually requires full amputation. The book as a whole had a powerful delivery and was very well written. I plan to read more by Dr. Gawande and will probably continually cite them as a confirmation that I want to be a doctor (and maybe even a surgeon - who knows)."
296,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Except for hypochondriacs, everyone should read this book. The surgeon-scribe Gawande is the perfect Virgil, escorting us through the Hell and Purgatory (and many happy endings) of uncertainties, mysteries and ambiguities of medicine. He shows us how physicians deal with learning curves in surgery, how they evaluate and deal with mistakes (discussed in large weekly sessions), what their trade conferences are like, and how institutions deal with bad doctors. Using unforgettable cases—a girl with a mysterious red patch that may or may not be flesh-eating bacteria, a pregnant woman who is seriously nauseous for months, the newscaster who has severe blushing, etc.—he illustrates the limits of medical knowledge. Gawande’s books tell us about the practice of medicine, but are in essence about the lessons of the virtues (and vices) applicable to any profession. Most of the chapters began as pieces for the New Yorker and retain that addictive informing-and-storytelling style; really fantastic! "
297,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970590-miteypen,4,"I've read several books by doctors about the medical profession and always find them intriguing. My favorites are those by Richard Selzer (Confessions of a Knife, Letters to a Young Doctor, etc.), who, like this author, is a surgeon.Where Selzer is more literary, this author is more informative and practical about the realities of medicine, such as the necessity of practicing on patients, the role that class plays in quality of treatment received, and the shot-in-the-dark nature of making diagnoses. I was so fascinated with this book that I read it straight through. It's easy to read, but not facile, and the author doesn't shy away from making it personal. I highly recommend Complications for anyone interested in health care, especially from the doctor's point of view. "
298,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1989201-zoom,4,"This is a collection of essays in the memoir genre, as opposed to a true memoir. It consists of interesting true tales from the world of medicine, and is written by a surgical resident. In some ways this book reminded me of some of Oliver Sachs' writing. The stories range from medical oddities to medical ethics and doctors gone bad. Among other things, these stories explore the reality that people make mistakes and doctors are people so doctors make mistakes - and they're basically practicing on us. Routine procedures are often not as routine as we might think, especially when the doctor is doing one of their first few of any particular surgery. Or when the doctor has become complacent and thinks they can do this surgery with their eyes closed. It occurred to me that I spent more time researching my plumber's qualifications and reputation than my doctor's. Anyway, it was an interesting read, and well written. I have no idea where Gawande gets the time to write, being a doctor and the father of three little kids, but I'm glad he does."
299,0312421702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"A very worthwhile if somewhat demanding read about the often underestimated margin of error in medicine. Gawande's book describes understandable human error when split-second decisions need to be made, doctors who burn out with others (colleagues, supporting staff, patients, and most of all the doctors themselves) slow to realize it and failing to make the necessary changes, mysterious ailments like chronic back pain, nausea, and uncontrollable blushing with elusive (nonexistent?) physical causes, etc., etc. Not surprisingly, Gawande is a friend of Malcolm Gladwell's and his book is somewhat reminiscent of that genre although it's a more challenging read -- perhaps not the best reading choice for someone who needs relaxing breaks in between Passover cleaning and cooking. Still, I enjoyed it and feel it deserves its high goodreads rating. Interesting, informative, and thought-provoking -- all the things a good non-fiction book should be."
