0,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,Not too bad - but way too easy: I was expecting something at a higher level. I was misled (by comments by other reviewers) into believing that the level of sophistication of the items treated in this book was reasonably good. 
1,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"The preface to this book contains the following explanation, which I think suffices to explain its reason for being:""For disciplines as diverse as literature, music, and art, there is a tradition of examining masterpieces -- the ""great novels"", the ""great symphonies"", the ""great paintings"" -- as the fittest and most illuminating objects of study. Books are written and courses are taught on precisely these topics in order to acquaint us with some of the creative milestones of the discipline and with the men and women who produced them.The present book offers an analogous approach to mathematics, where the creative unit is not the novel or symphony, but the theorem. ... ""On the whole, I think the author does a commendable job in fulfilling this promise. There are, however, some shortcomings: The book states that Fermat's Last Theorem is still unsolved, when it was in fact proved by Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor in 1995. Of course, the book was published in 1990, so what it stated was true at the time of writing. A second shortcoming, in my estimation, is the total absence of any mention of Group Theory, its origins during the French Revolution (Evariste Galois and subsequent enhancements by Sophus Lie, both of whom have fascinating histories, albeit tragic ones). Perhaps the importance of Group Theory was not apparent in 1990, but I doubt that. Bottom line: The book needs a new edition.Just as I would have a hard time going through one of the standard ""great masterpieces of fiction"" tomes because of my lack of appreciation of many so-called classics, so a typically non-mathematical reader would probably have a difficult time reading this book, at least in the sections that deal with the proofs of the theorems. Even I, with a strong mathematical background, found my eyes glazing over during some of the proofs -- especially those based on Euclidean style geometry (all the ancient Greek and other ancient cultures were based on this kind of geometry). You know, the kind of geometry where, in school, you were asked to prove that this angle is equal to that other angle. I was never very good at that -- perhaps I lacked the spatial aptitude, and there never seemed to be any real rules to follow; it was basically trial and error. I *was* good at what we called Coordinate Geometry (I think they call it Analytic Geometry now), probably because there were more easily identified rules.I found the last two chapters, ""The Non-Denumerability of the Continuum"" and ""Cantor and the Transfinite Realm"", to be particularly interesting, because I had not previously learned about those areas.One final comment, which applies not only to this book but to most if not all mathematics books I've read or studied: I feel that one of the reasons why so many people stop paying detailed attention (glazed eye onset) to a mathematical proof is not only that it's often difficult to understand, but that it's often presented in a very dense manner. Essential steps are subsumed into a single paragraph with no attempt to identify each step. I believe that, if there was an express attempt to present the proof using bulleted or numbered lists, with relatively short explanations in each item, more people could stay awake longer and be more likely to understand the proof. Perhaps this is because it would provide more of a visual aid than densely written paragraphs. Mathematicians often forget that they do this for a living, so it becomes second nature to them, while other mere mortals might benefit from a different approach and/or presentation."
2,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1086409-shelly,5,"I finally finished this book! It's been a long time coming. I've owned it for almost ten years. I finally picked it up to read a few months ago. I don't know why I waited so long. It's a real gem. The main reason it took me so long to get through is the format. You can read it a chapter at a time, as you have time, and read other books in between, etc, and it really doesn't matter. I'd read a chapter, then read other books, then read another chapter, etc. Each chapter is about one of the more important theorems in mathematics. I loved almost every chapter. I was a little bored by the two Cantor chapters, but I think that was primarily because I don't love set theory and didn't study it a whole lot in college. I'd give the book five stars if not for those two chapters.The chapter dealing with Sir Isaac Newton nearly had me in tears. His accomplishments and understanding are just mind boggling. I took a course on the history of mathematics in college. It was horribly boring. I had to fight sleep off. This book would have been a brilliant text for that class. Sure it doesn't cover every blasted mathematical discovery since the beginning of time, but the approach this book takes seems so much more practical and well rounded. It has just the right mix of history and proofs, and was almost always very engaging and interesting. It covers so many of the really really important things. My class would have been much better if it had used this sort of approach verses the linear, this happened then this happened then this happened... approach. History can be so boring, but this book was very fun. People who don't like math, and wouldn't care to follow a proof while reading won't like this one bit.One final thought: Newton once explained that the reason he was so successful at solving problems was ""by thinking on them continuously."" I wish I could harness a small bit of that focus. Sure, I've got to be able to multitask a little, but wouldn't it be nice to use a bit more focus in our lives? I think I could get more done, and do it better, if I'd procrastinate less, and not do things in pieces, but just set about doing a task, and get it done. If that makes sense. Isn't Newton inspiring in so many ways? Don't we all wish we could be like him? Except maybe a little more well adjusted and happy?"
3,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7556938-jo-o-vaz,4,"What a merry walkthrough over the work of History’s mathematical geniuses!, faith in Humanity: Restored!And in Bertrand Russels's words: Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. "
4,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2659716-martin-cohen,4,"The math history presented is very good. The mathematical exposition is uneven. Some of it is good and some not so good. The chapter I had the most difficulty with was the one on Heron's formula. Theorems are presented without any indicator of where they are headed. Dunham keeps promising that the formula will eventually be derived, but I gave up beforehand. The other chapter I would criticize is the one on Euler's number theory, but for different reasons. In developing Fermat's Little Theorem, Dunham derives the result that (a+1)^p - a^p -1 is divisible by p, by asking us to assume that the expression for 1/p((a+1)^p - a^p -1) is a whole number. I don't know why this was done, since it is easy to prove the divisibility directly, using the Binomial Equation discussed at length in the book. Later in the same chapter, mentioning the formula for geometric series would have made much clearer Euler's work on factoring Fermat numbers.Overall I would recommend the book. If you are not that much into proofs, there is much of interest in the biographical and historical material. If you are willing to do a little work in following the proofs, there is much to appreciate."
5,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,4,"I enjoyed this tour through the history of the development of mathematics, from Euclidean geometry to the more abstract challenges of modern theory. The author tells a good story, and there is plenty of mathematical detail for those who are interested. In particular, the explanation of Cantor’s work on infinity is the clearest I have seen.Sometimes the story may be too good. My confidence in the history I did not know was reduced by two errors (both on page 129) in the history that I do know. There is no evidence that the Arabs burned the Library of Alexandria in 621, as it was probably long gone by then. And Muhammad did not die in Jerusalem. How many other old myths are being recycled here?However, I am sure the math is good, even if the story behind it might occasionally be questionable. I recommend this book for those with an interest in mathematics, but do not expect an advanced treatment of the ideas in question."
6,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6564745-james-swenson,4,"The title is a fair description: Dunham presents highlights from math history as great works of art. He carries this analogy through the book consistently, for example identifying Georg Cantor (-1918) as the mathematical parallel of his contemporary Vincent van Gogh.Dunham has done an excellent job of selecting exemplary theorems that can be explained to an interested reader having no special mathematical training, that are associated with the most greatest mathematicians of all time, and that influenced the future of mathematics. In addition to the ""great theorems,"" he finds time to describe many other masterpieces.Of Dunham's twelve ""Great Theorems,"" Heron's formula and Newton's general binomial theorem have by far the weakest credentials. Looking for candidates to replace them, though, gives a good idea of why they were chosen. Dunham certainly had a clear idea of his intended audience, and decided on that basis not to include any calculus beyond the Cauchy/Weierstrass definition of the limit -- this eliminates some clearly Great Theorems, most notably the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and explains the inclusion of the binomial theorem: ""It was a must, for example, to have selections from ...Newton."" (p. vii) On the other hand, the beautiful results of graph theory (particularly Euler's polyhedron formula) could hardly have been included without requiring a third chapter about Euler.I recommend this book to a general reader interested in the history of mathematics, and particularly to undergraduate students of mathematics: it's a great chance to pick up the folklore that ""everyone knows"" but that isn't always taught explicitly."
7,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5176570-melanie,4,"This was a class book for a 'History of Math' course I took during my undergrad and it remains one of the few books from that era in my life that I actually return to now and then... Geeky, sure. Dorky, definitely, but this book provides a fascinating account of how advances in mathematics follows progress in civilization and vice versa. From everybody's favorite theorem (the Pythagorean theorem that is) to the dreaded nightmare-inducing calculus (thank you, Sir Isaac Newton!) and beyond this little book packs quite the punch. Even if math isn't your thing, you can skip the proofs and just read the blurbs about the life, times and genius-inspiring circumstances of great historical figures. "
8,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17505766-alyssa,4,"Bad habits die hard, so let's start with a quotation, shall we? Make it a double one, since in the book, it originally is a quotation already. (And, like I said, bad habits die hard, so this is actually the conclusion of the book.)Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty -a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.If you ask me, this quite sums up the idea of the book in the sense that, by going through the history behind some of mathematics' greatest theorems, it shows the beauty of mathematics... but it should be noted that it's quite difficult to go through the book if you don't have some basics (and maybe more than basics) in the domains of mathematics explored in there. In other words, I don't think it suits people who would only be interested in the historical side of mathematics, you need to know a bit of the mathematics themselves. Well, maybe not for all chapters, because some of these theorems are easy concepts to grasp and/or are explained quite simply-ish (and Dunham even writes at times that such theorem goes beyond the level of the book)... but other chapters, not so much. Or maybe you can just skip over the proof and technical details, but I'm not sure if it's enjoyable to read this book that way.That aside, from a (kinda) mathematics student POV, it's a very enjoyable reading. When you go through years of studies, you usually only get the technical side of stuffs (unless you have special profs who like to add anecdotes to their classes --those are the best, it makes it more interesting imo) and all history is swept under the rug. With this book, I got to catch up a bit on history. I think there's only Cardano's solution of the cubic (chapter 6) and Cantor's infinites (chapters 11-12) for which I knew most of the story already. In any case, all through the book, I was reminded of my many many classes, a small trip down memory lane so to say.It covers a variety of domains: geometry (that I feel like I haven't been in touch with for a couple of years), algebra, number theory (the one I've, most likely, been studying more thoroughly), calculus (the one I've never really got along with)... And although the table contents seems to indicate that only a couple of great mathematicians are included in the book, there are actually so many more that come into the picture as you go through the chapters (a couple of them I've never even heard of). Another interesting point was to be confronted to those long-ass sentences they used to use. Maybe it's because my classes were all taught in French and the phrasing is slightly different from the modern English one, but sometimes I had to read it over a couple times to grasp the idea.The only bad point I have in mind is that it was too short (although I do admit that a longer book might have been harder to digest). I feel like there's a good amount of other interesting theorems/theories that could have fitted in the book (not that I have specific ones in mind right now though), but maybe the history behind them isn't as fascinating as those included..."
9,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2158790-nyssa,4,"The historical and biographical aspects of this text are fascinating in themselves. One certainly has to have a strong foundation, however, to understand the mathematical components fully and in context. "
10,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/681359-billy,4,"At times the proofs can be a little hard to follow, but the book was definitely written for the layman with some calculus background. However, since the book covers such diverse mathematical topics, it is difficult to fully appreciate every theorem. The author does try to present every theorem in its historical context and give background on the great minds of the discoverers.The most striking point of the entire book to me was how miserable the vast majority of the featured mathematicians lives were. They lived lonely lives and suffered from bouts of mental illness. I wonder if people like Cardano, Cantor, Newton, and Turing succeeded because of their faults or in spite of them. Their work was a great service to humanity, but was it worth it in the end for them. Would they have traded their greatness for a normal, happy life? Reading about their lives is enough to make one hope that they never accomplish anything great. Of course, there are plenty of people who lead miserable lives without accomplishing anything too.The example that really sits with me was the final one illustrated by Cantor. He was a brilliant man who tackled the problem of the infinite. He spent much of his life struggling to prove or disprove his continuum hypothesis. It is believed that his obsession over this problem contributed to his bouts of mental illness and the complete breakdowns that he suffered. It may have even expedited his death. Twenty years after his death it was proven that this hypothesis could not be disproved. Another twenty years later it was also proven that the hypothesis could not be proven. This meant that he spent his life obsessing over a problem that could not be solved. "
11,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5998651-wes-townsend,4,"A book about mathematics, written for the layman, but with some pretty deep math in there. As someone who likes math, this book was fascinating. A lot of it was about famous proofs I was already familiar with (Euclid's infinite primes, Cantor's diagonalization) but it was still really cool to read about them again. Dunham's tone is casual and fun, and even if the historical/biographical bits didn't seem very rigorous, the book was still very fun to read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who thinks math is fun."
12,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52005089-antonio,5,"A quote from Bertrand Russel, which is offered in the afterword, perfectly sums up the contents of this book:""Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only thruth, but supreme beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.""William Dunham perfectly transports this feeling. 5/5."
13,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91180963-xiao,4,"quite an interesting book，and the explanation is very clear. The only thing I feel a bit not very good is that the gap between math before 1750 and after 1850 is quite large. after euler the book jumps to cantor,which is a huge jump."
14,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68478217-anis-jerimy,5,"Wonderful, amazing and great 😊 this book is in itself a genius way to present maths...Math is an art and I am everyday fascinated by its history and its answers ....strongly recommend this book for all lovers of Mathematics"
15,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57747719-tommy-jacobs,5,A good read about math history!
16,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636950-bob-lewis,5,"In a phrase, this is one of my favorite books on mathematics. I read it first when it was recommended by my Calculus I professor and thought it was great. I read it again when I took a course in the history of mathematics and thought it was brilliant. Now it remains one of my favorites and I return to it regularly for discussion of some remarkable theorems and the great minds who produced them.One of the first questions anyone might have before reading a book about mathematics is what level of mathematical sophistication is required on the part of the reader. In this case, the reader can feel pretty safe. While these are real and deep mathematical theorems, their proofs only require high-school level mathematics. In the vast majority of cases, the reader familiar with basic algebra and a little bit of geometry will have no trouble following the discussions. One theorem (Newton's approximation of pi) requires a little bit of integral calculus and another (the discussion of some of Euler's sums) requires a smidge of elementary trigonometry. In both cases, the author holds the reader's hand through the discussion so even if you haven't taken a course in trigonometry or calculus, you'll still be able to follow most of the conversation.In fact, even if you don't really have a lot of algebra and geometry, the bulk of the book will still be accessible to you. The majority of the text is a history of mathematics wherein the author discusses the context and importance of the theorems and some biographical details of their discoverers. While I find the recreations of the proofs themselves to be perhaps the most interesting part, the reader with a general interest (even if that interest is not supported by mathematical skill) will find the book fascinating. For those of us who do have some knowledge of mathematics, though, the recreations of the theorems presented in their historical context provides a rich and inspiring series of vignettes from the history of mathematics.This brings us to another important point. While this is a book about the history of mathematics. it is not *a* history of mathematics, and the theorems selected are not the only ""great"" theorems of mathematics, but a cross-section thereof. Many readers of sufficient mathematical background may quibble over the inclusion of some theorems at the expense of others--personally I would like to have seen more from combinatorics--but no one can deny that these theorems are remarkable in their elegance and in their importance in the development of mathematics from the Ancient Greeks to the very end of the nineteenth century.It might be helpful to know what theorems are actually included in the book. Aside from a handful of lemmas and minor results presented before or after each of the ""Great Theorems,"" the book consists of a single major result per chapter. They are:*Hippocrates' quadrature of the lune*Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem*Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes*Archimedes' determination of a formula for circular area*Heron's formula for triangular area*Cardano's solution of the cubic*Netwon's approximation of pi*Bernoulli's proof of the divergence of the harmonic series*Euler's evaluation of the infinite series 1+1/4+1/9+1/16+...*Euler's refutation of Fermat's conjecture*Cantor's proof that the interval (0,1) is not countable*Cantor's theorem that the power set of A has strictly greater cardinality than AEach of these theorems is surrounded by the historical discussion that makes this book a triumph not merely of teaching a dozen results to students but of actually educating students on the human enterprise of mathematics. It is not only interesting but, I think, important to be reminded of the human side of a field as abstract as mathematics, and Dunham bridges the mathematical and the biographical with remarkable dexterity. It is useful for the student of mathematics to understand that Cantor's work on the transfinite was resisted by the mathematicians of his day just as much as students struggle with it when they're exposed to it in today's lecture halls. It might further be useful to know that, perhaps partly due to his demeanor and perhaps partly due to the attacks on his work, Cantor spent much of his life in mental hospitals--and yet, despite his unhappy life his work has achieved immortality as one of the great developments in mathematical history.I can't recommend this book highly enough for the mathematician, the math student, or the merely curious. In fact, I recommend reading it twice. First, just read it straight through and enjoy the story of mathematics told through these vignettes. Then read it again with pencil and paper in hand and work through the theorems and proofs with the author as your guide. You'll come away with a much deeper understanding of and appreciation for these great theorems in particular and mathematics in general."
17,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93501664-matthew-paul,5,"As a Calculus teacher, I am always baffled at students knowledge of history especially in regard to the mathematics. This of course is the fault of stale 21st century curriculum that teaches math as mastery of procedure than as the art of problem solving. It pains when when I ask students which mathematical mastermind derived such a beautiful argument, and of a sample size of 100 only 2 to 3 have heard of Archimedes let alone Gauss or Euler. As such, I began intentionally adding historical and small bios of history's finest in to as many lessons as I could. I feel that this shift has brought mathematics to more life in the classroom, as the focus is now viewing math as a body of knowledge that humanity has building upon and exploring together for thousands of years. It also helps build connections among their other classroom studies building stronger academic awareness. After reading Journey through Genius, I have learned so much more history and beautiful arguments to bring into the classroom. The author's ability to tell a story was gripping, his ability to present mathematical proofs coherently and seamlessly was incredible, and the wide array of tangential tidbits of historical figures and factoids was masterfully chosen. I am truly inspired by this book, and believe that my students will love to hear these stories in the classroom."
18,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"A decent trawl through a few millennia of mathematics, focusing on specific theorems that the author describes as ""the great theorems of mathematics"". The pen pictures of the mathematicians are good but what sets the book apart from the large number of similar books is the focus on specific theorems and their proofs. So there's quite a lot of actual mathematics in the book. For me this is both a strength and a weakness - the former because it makes the achievements more real but the latter because it's been many years since I had the patience to go through a mathematical proof properly.I wasn't entirely enamoured of the choice of theorems but I understand the author's dilemma in wanting to choose theorems whose proofs could be understood by non-mathematicians and also wanting to include contributions from the most important mathematicians in his list. Ultimately, I felt that the book was only partially successful in convincing me of the beauty of the proofs and I suspect that this was partly down to the choice of theorems covered. Cantor's diagonal arguments being some of the more successful examples in this regard."
19,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95128150-htwight,4,"I read this book for a history of mathematics course I took in college. It was an excellent introduction to the history of mathematics. Talking to William Dunham was also an interesting experience. He mentioned that the publishers didn't want anything to be included that required more knowledge than some basic calculus, and he also didn't like the title ""Journey Through Genius"" at first though it grew on him as the book gained popularity.Dunham teaches (or taught, I don't know) a history of math course himself, and is obviously an expert on the topic. It would have been nice to have included more advanced material, but the math covered is both important to the history of math and engaging enough that you will not forget it. Aside from the math, Dunham also includes historical bits about the mathematicians themselves. From the outrageous Pythagorean response to the discovery of irrational numbers to the battle of Tartaglia vs Cardano, the bizarre history of mathematicians lightens the more rigorous concepts introduced. A must-read for anyone unfamiliar with the history of math."
20,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63086025-danielle,5,"It took me a while to finally read this book but I believe it to be an all time classic. This sets the example for great math history books. Of course there is an inherent risk at choosing to tell certain stories (in this case, certain theorems) above others, Dunham really does make a great selection of great, unexpected, brilliant theorems that are easy to explain, easy to understand, that had a great impact and with solutions that were truly a work of genius. Dunham does a great job at linking each theorem of his choosing to the next, telling the little anecdotes that happened in between, keeps us updated with important characters in the story that were incredibly decisive even if their work was not chosen as the protagonist. Along with the story, we get to read a simplified and modern version of both the theorem and its proof, so it is not only history but some great math in as well. I would absolutely recommend this book to every math aficionado. "
21,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29901205-hana,4,"I read this for class, but I actually really enjoyed it and finished the whole thing even though the last few chapters were cut from our curriculum. The book focuses more on the history of mathematics than the mathematics itself; I think most of it is written for a reader with a pre-calculus background, with a few chapters needing a calculus background to understand the math more clearly (though not understanding the details of the proofs isn't necessary to understand the larger significance or history). The way the history is told is really engaging and interesting. It's a bit dated; for example, it states that Fermat's Last Theorem remains unproven, though it was proven in 1995, but for the most part it is a fairly expansive coverage of mathematical history."
22,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7101133-hong,4,"Journey Through Genius contains mathematics histories and technical details on important subjects, written for layman. With this huge subject, Dunham probably put a lot of thoughts into selecting what to include, and how. Readers will get some sense on the broad pattern of mathematics development and how it fits into human civilization progression. Readers will also find detailed stories such as how Issac Newton left his work on Calculus unpublished for years. Dunham shares with readers several scenes that demonstrate the beauty of mathematics. These scenes vary in the level of details from almost-complete technical proofs to hand waving description of critical ideas. "

40,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20133722-biz-stolz,4,"	In Journey through Genius, William Dunham introduced some of the most influential mathematicians in history alongside explanations for one or two of their most profound discoveries in math. Journey through Genius gives a historical context for the mathematicians and their discoveries, and tries to convince the reader of the greatness of the discovery—the worthiness, as it may be, for why that piece of mathematical history has made it into this book. While the content provided in Journey through Genius is accessible to those with only a high-school level mathematics education, the means to coming to the results (via the proofs included in the book) are still so genius that one with a more in-depth understanding can appreciate the proofs given. If the purpose of the book was to inform the reader of some of the great mathematical theorems and those who discovered them, then this book mostly achieved its goal—its main fault is the short-sighted nature of its scope.	There are twelve chapters in Journey through Genius, each one (more or less) dedicated to a main theorem and to the life of the man who discovered it. Each chapter introduced context of that area of math at the time of the discovery, gave a proof outlining the main theorem, and concluded with an explanation of how the theorem influenced math and sometimes summarized the rest of the discoverer’s life. Not only was each of the twelve chapters focused on someone (or, in Chapter 11’s case, some people) from the Western world, but even introductions and conclusion rarely mention anyone outside of the Western culture. Dunham tries to explain this obvious exclusion in one of his chapters, stating, amongst other things, that “Because the Islamic mathematicians put less emphasis on proving their results in complete generality, no great theorem appears here” (131). This weak excuse for omitting some of the great thinkers of the Islamic world is more consolation than the void of an excuse for why discoveries from China, India, and other realms of the world aren’t explored. 	Even if the excuse Dunham supplies is true, it doesn’t explain why more of the Islamic mathematicians’ work isn’t explored in the introduction or conclusion of the chapters. Throughout the introductions and conclusions of the chapters, Dunham does thorough exploration of other theorems that aren’t the chapter’s central topic. He does this time and time again, and in a few of the chapters he goes so far as to mention that there was some progress made in the area by non-Western mathematicians, yet no short proof was supplied, no exploration of any non-Western “discovered” mathematics was ever explained by Dunham. In total, there are less than five pages dedicated to non-Western mathematical discoveries (out of 283), which, in my opinion, is Journey through Genius’s greatest downfall.	The information that Dunham did include about the mathematicians and the discoveries that he did highlight were both intellectually and emotionally satisfying. I appreciated learning how each great mathematician’s discovery was proven and about the background for each great mathematician; hearing how each embodied genius, handled his achievements, and went about his life. The background given for each mathematician increased the impact felt when being led through how each mathematician proved his theorem, giving the already extraordinary proofs another layer of meaning and understanding. I learned much about the state of mathematics from Journey through Genius —from the discipline’s history, to the construction of proofs of some truly great results, to the realities of the Western-centric mindset of some of the mathematical community that still pervade today."
41,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15797133-will,3,"""Already uneasy over the foundations of their subject, mathematicians got a solid dose of ridicule from a clergyman, Bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753). Bishop Berkeley, in his caustic essay 'The Analyst, or a Discourse addressed to an Infidel Mathematician,' derided those mathematicians who were ever ready to criticize theology as being based upon unsubstantiated faith, yet who embraced the calculus in spite of its foundational weaknesses. Berkeley could not resist letting them have it:'All these points [of mathematics], I say, are supposed and believed by certain rigorous exactors of evidence in religion, men who pretend to believe no further than they can see... But he who can digest a second or third fluxion, a second or third differential, need not, methinks, be squeamish about any point in divinity.'As if that were not devastating enough, Berkeley added the wonderfully barbed comment:'And what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments. And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, not yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities...?'Sadly, the foundations of the calculus had come to this - to 'ghosts of departed quantities.' One imagines hundreds of mathematicians squirming restlessly under this sarcastic phrase.Gradually the mathematical community had to address this vexing problem. Throughout much of the eighteenth century, they had simply been having too much success - and too much fun - in exploiting the calculus to stop and examine its underlying principles. But growing internal concerns, along with Berkeley's external sniping, left them little choice. The matter had to be resolved.Thus we find a string of gifted mathematicians working on the foundational questions. The process of refining the idea of 'limit' was an excruciating one, for the concept is inherently quite deep, requiring a precision of thought and an appreciation of the nature of the real number system that is by no means easy to come by. Gradually, though, mathematicians chipped away at this idea. By 1821, the Frenchman Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) had proposed this definition:'When the values successively attributed to a particular variable approach indefinitely a fixed value, so as to end by differing from it by as little as one wishes, this latter is called the limit of all the others.'"""
42,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54679645-luke-paulsen,4,"When you stop to think about it, this is actually a really impressive book. Without assuming any math background beyond high-school-level algebra and geometry, Dunham presents a condensed history of mathematics from Ancient Greece up through 1900s Europe. What's more, that isn't even his main focus! The point of the book is to detail to some of the greatest mathematical masterpieces from that history-- from Euclid's geometric constructions and infinite primes up through Cantor's diagonal argument and set theory, with plenty of attention to greats like Archimedes, Newton, and Euler in between. If you're an interested but not super-mathematical reader looking for an introduction to the human side of mathematics-- history, literature, culture, and especially aesthetic wonder-- this book is a great choice.I'm pretty mathy myself, so it's hard for me to analyze how difficult it will be for a non-technical reader to follow the arguments. My general sense is that they're somewhat dense-- they have to be studied, not skimmed-- but that they aren't qualitatively difficult; there are no unreasonable assumptions or conceptual leaps involved. The upside of this approach is that you get a very authentic experience of the math involved. I never felt that Dunham was oversimplifying or cutting corners. In fact, in several cases I noticed exactly the opposite happening: Dunham presented the arguments in their fascinating original form, which my textbooks had skipped over in order to present a simpler and more modern proof.If this book has a weakness, it's actually in the non-mathematical sections. By that I don't mean the prose-- Dunham is an engaging and fluent writer-- but the content. Dunham's mathematics may never be simplistic, but his history occasionally is; he tends to fall into the trap of making blanket generalizations about cultures and mindsets. Fortunately this is not a major part of the book, and I appreciated the attempt to provide some background and tie the mathematical world into a broader picture of intellectual history. Overall this is a book that I enjoyed and would highly recommend."
43,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1829065-mike,5,"Loved it. Great exposition of some of the best ideas in the history of mathematics. I've seen some other books like this, but this is the first one that really explains the way the Greeks did their mathematics. I've seen Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem before, but this is the first time it really made sense, and the first time I understood why Euclid had to prove it that way: he had no concept of what we would call algebra. For him a square was just that, and the theorem isn't a^2 + b^2 = c^2, but ""if you make each side of a triangle into a square, the total area of the squares on the shorter sides is the same as the area of the square on the long side.""I have a couple of quibbles. He uses ""awesome"" too much; that's more of an obnoxious mannerism now than it was when Dunham wrote, and it grates. More important: One of the virtues of this book is that it's brief, and Dunham limits himself to math that is important, elegant, and easily explained. Selection is very important, and Dunham's excellent sense of what to leave out is why this book works so well. With that in mind, maybe it's unfair of me to complain about what was left out. But this book ends with the 19th century. There are brief mentions of Hilbert and Gödel, and that's about it. I would have liked to see it push a bit farther: Hilbert's reformulation of mathematics, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and maybe even Turing's undecidability theorem. Surely that's not too much to ask; it's just following the story he was telling in his last chapter through until the end."
44,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2588936-simon,3,"This book is trying to walk a very narrow path. On one side it wants to contain real mathematics (i.e. Legitimate proofs of theorems), but on the it the other side it wants to remain easy enough for a general audience. What were left with is a hybrid between a ""pop-math"" book and a math textbook that seems to somehow fall short of it's intended goal of conveying the beauty of mathematics. It's a unique blending which seems to be one of the first of its kind to my knowledge. But perhaps it's the first of its kind because goal the author is trying to accomplish is not really possible.The main drawback of the book is that it can't touch on an encompassing variety of mathematical fields because most fields require too much prior practice to be digestible for a general audienceSeeing genius/beauty in mathematics comes mainly through three routes. One is from witnessing the interconnectedness of a wide variety of seemingly unrelated fields, another is penetrating the depth and complexity of a single field, and the last is understanding it's utility in modeling reality. This book does neither of these things One aspect I really enjoyed however was the heavy inclusion of history with the actual math in the format of the book. Each theorem was introduced with large compelling historical backgrounds and then followed with its historical impacts after the proof. This is something I sincerely wish more math textbooks would do and I think there is a lot of potential with this concept to create a fresh unique and compelling math textbook."
45,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8455487-lana,3,"Overall, I liked the book but there were a few things that detracted from the experience. It gives a lot of historical context from a broad perspective, and does a great job of foreshadowing (this mathematician shows up later in chapter 6, etc.) and referencing back to prior material. The author even draws comparisons and points out parallels between the evolution of art and mathematics. I found the math easy to follow and engaging.Now for the downsides:First, this book claims to be geared at someone who completed high school mathematics, but I doubt that anyone lacking a strong background in second-semester college calculus could really appreciate (or even understand!) the second half of the book.Second, the book title is misleading, because it is more of a history of mathematics as evidenced by the work of the masters than a focus on a few great theorems. I expected to find a single great theorem examined in each chapter, but many chapters encompass several theorems as exemplars of a particular mathematician's work, and some mathematicians take up several chapters. Very confusing structure.My last gripe is that the book was published in 1990, so incorrectly states that Fermat's Last Theorem is still unsolved. It is in desperate need of an update to reflect this major development in number theory, and how it fits into the context of Fermat's other work as discussed in several different chapters."
46,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7783352-frank,5,"If you are reading this for general interest, it is a nice survey of the history of mathematics with each of the 12 chapters highlighting a theorem of particular importance. The history of mathematics between these ""Great Theorems"" is covered in the conclusion of the chapter or the introduction to the next. Each chapter also has an epilogue exploring some topic or historical figure related to the subject of the chapter. I use this book when I teach History of Mathematics. It is written for a general audience although it helps to have had a little calculus and some exposure to formal proof. I have to supplement the text with exercises to challenge Mathematics and Mathematics Education majors, but using a text that won't break their budget means a lot to me. There are some shortcomings you should take into consideration. This book makes mention of the contributions of non-European and female mathematicians, but I think it is fair to criticize it for focusing on ""dead white men."" I make it a point to talk about this in my class. Also, the coverage of mathematics after the year 1900 is a matter of a few pages. "
47,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23230531-alex,5,"Dunham does the field of mathematics a great service in this concise and entertaining history of the subject. Journey through Genius was one of the quickest reads I've ever had thanks to Dunham's intelligent-but-fun writing style. He does here what every math course I've ever taken failed to do: He provides the interested student with some context for the great theorems which we encounter over the years, from the times and cultures in which they were discovered to the characters who discovered them.What's more, Dunham does it all in a very accessible style. He carefully explains the more elementary proofs step-by-step and clearly summarizes the more advanced ones, assuming no prior knowledge of mathematics at all. He is careful not to go over the heads of his less mathematically experienced readers while keeping even the most brilliant mathematician interested.For anyone interested in the brilliant minds and amazing stories behind the development of mathematics, Journey through Genius is a must-read. It leaves one delightfully entertained and hungry for more."
48,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,4,"This. This is why I believe in God. From chapter 1: In this sense, quadrature represented not only the triumph of human reason, but also the inherent simplicity and beauty of the universe itself. Some great stories about geniuses who shaped the world of mathematics. Of course, some of these folks were a bit demented. Cardano (chapter 6) who geometrically, rather than algebraically, solved x^3 + mx = n in the 16th century was borderline insane. Isaac Newton shoved sticks behind his eyes to study the lights that formed in his eyes by changing their shape. Yikes. Math is wonderful. From another early chapter, I didn't realize that there was a formula for the area of a regular polygon! (It's ½hQ, where Q is the circumference of the polygon and h is the distance of a line drawn from the center of the polygon to one side, but perpendicular to that side.) It's basically the same as the formula for the area of a circle. Math is amazing. Read this book to see just how amazing it is. "
49,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,5,"A fantastic overview of math history. I would have liked to set the math in context with the history of the times, but there was just enough of that to keep me happy. I found several short easy projects that I could do with my students, a wealth of math quotes to make a nerd swoon, and a couple of interesting discussions. For people afraid of math, I assure you, you can read the opening part of each chapter, get a sense for the historical context and significance and than skip on. The math has been neatly corralled so as not to scare you to much.I am not scared of math, but I do not find it interesting to read. I worked out a couple of minor proofs along with the author/math genius he was writing about, but I did not attempt to read all of the math. I skimmed the math, and read the historical bits, and I, in my capacity as math teacher am giving you permission to do the same.I did, however, take notes."
50,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15655372-alan-clark,5,"This is one of my favourite books of all time. Although I have a degree in Mathematics I learned a lot from it, although you need no more than a rudimentary knowledge of mathematics to understand it (plus a fair amount of concentration).The book is worth the price even if you only read the amazing geometric proof of Heron's formula. Heron seems to wander all over the place making apparently pointless constructions, but then brings everything together and suddenly pulls the rabbit out of the hat, a beautiful formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its three sides. With some proofs you can see the thought processes that were involved, but in this case I cannot begin to imagine how anyone would even think of performing the operations used, it is clearly the work of a genius of the first order.I was also fascinated by Euler's derivation for various infinite series for pi, which have always fascinated me, but every chapter is fascinating."
51,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/152976-audrey,3,"I love the concept of this book, and I very much enjoyed the theorems included in it. It's given me an appreciation for what Math is really about--which is no insignificant feat. On the other hand, I have to admit that it wasn't quite watered-down enough for me. There were plenty of places where I lost the thread of what was going on. Mostly, this happened when the author explained a concept in words (usually in a completely comprehensible way), and then said something like ""which, of course, gives us this equation."" For the life of me, I never could quite grasp why it gave us that particular equation.It's absolutely a worthwhile read, but it's not, as the preface claims, a book whose notation can be understood by anyone who's passed high school Math. If you, like me, haven't thought about Math since meeting your university's core requirements, you should probably read a slightly more fundamental book before embarking on this one. I wish I had."
52,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17009470-bob-woodley,4,"This book is a history of math, via the great theorems of math.So much fun. Readable anecdotes about the lives of the great mathematicians interspersed with lucid explanation of their greatest proofs. So often in school, the historical context is lost, which is a shame! How can one appreciate Euler's solution to the Basel Problem without knowing the earlier attempts by the Bernoullis and others to solve it? The author is a master at explaining complex proofs. The Basel Problem, the Cantor Sets - all are now clear to me thanks to Dunham's explanations.One gripe: is that a third of the book is spent on the ancient greeks and I find geometric proofs rather dull. Another grip: it would have been nice to learn more about 20th century math, but perhaps that defies simplification to the level required.Another gripe: the parallels between the history of math and art were obvious and unnecessary and unilluminating."
53,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/773604-adrian,5,"I think this book is a masterpiece! W. Dunham describes the history of mathematics by going over some of the most remarkable theorems and ideas along with their inventors and proofs. The book begins on Hippocrates' quadrature of the lune and ends on Cantor's infinite sets and one may just stand and wonder at the genius and creativity of people described in the book. The book is fun to read as it includes aspects satisfiable to all kind of readers and knowledge seekers. It talks about theorems, etc. providing lot of insight into problem solving and tools present in math. It describes biographies of key mathematicians in the history along with many stories. The book is also able to inspire people who would like to occupy a place in history, as I'm pretty sure the creativeness and inventivenss of people included may be very inspiring for others."
54,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,4,"This was a good book, but I wasn't the target audience---it was aimed at a more lay audience. He wanted to present the history of mathematics with major theorems as touchstones. He (sort of, mostly) proved the theorems, put them in context, and discussed what followed. But he was hamstrung by needing to keep to theorems that he could prove with HS algebra. Still, some cool stuff. Some very clever ways of proving the convergence of the harmonic series. And I hadn't seen Archimedes' proof that the pi for area is the same as the pi for circumference. (Though he skimmed over the part where he says, essentially, that tan(theta)>theta.) It was funny in the beginning when he was talking about which theorems to include---he said you couldn't do it without including Archimedes, Euclid, Newton and Euler. Seriously, no Gauss? Heron's theorem (with proof) was pretty cool."
55,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809742-benjamin,4,"This is a great book. The idea of presenting important mathematical results in a historical context is certainly not new, but Dunham's execution is notable. The history he includes is engaging and fits together into an overall narrative. His presentation of the math was equally well selected, as his choice of theorems allowed him to explore everything in an elementary manner. Those results he does offer without proof, which for the most part occur in the historical sections, are stated simply and explicitly, without recourse to strained analogies.my favorite quote: ""Contrary to popular belief, imaginary numbers entered the realm of mathematics not as a tool for solving quadratics but as a tool for solving cubics."""

Whether their field of interest was music, science, math, or literature, I find great inspiration in hearing their life stories and studying their works. This book satisfied me on both counts. The biographical information about each mathematician enlightened me about their historical context and their humanity.

What a treat! I would read it on the bus to and from work (5-odd years since graduating in pure mathematics I became nostalgic), making my 25-minute ride (one way) pass in no time...To write on any subject, one obviously needs the knowledge of it. However, to write a MASTERPIECE (about masterpieces in the chosen field), I think, requires two more ingredients: passion for the subject, in this case mathematics and its history, and the talent for writing about it in an engaging way. William Dunham undoubtedly demonstrated both.A MUST READ FOR A MATHEMATICIAN!"
59,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50694202-marek-rybakiewicz,5,"While unnecessarily exhaustive with the algebra, the book provides the greatest insight into the maths of the ancients in a very compact way. The prose always feels necessary and provides good relief from the proofs themselves, which always flow naturally from the story.My only gripe is that there is little noted of the great modern theorems, although it is stated initially in the book that the knowledge base need not surpass algebra, so I cannot hold this criticism against the author.A very fun take on the maths and minds that provided the foundations we have today. Would definitely recommend. "

Dunham's explanations should be fairly understandable for those without much formal education in mathematics, but I expect they will be too difficult or extensive now and then for a popular audience. On occasion he gets a bit heavy-handed with his own ideology, distracting from the central purpose of unfolding mathematical history, but he doesn't get distracted too often."

I graduated in Mathematics Education, and while I can understand everything, sometimes there are proofs that take a little extra brain power.

There are some more chapters I would have liked, e.g. doesn't Euler's identity deserve a full chapter? Does Aristotle or Turing not even deserve a mention in a book of all time greats? Should Cantor get two chapters and Riemann, Godel be pushed in epilogues and special mentions?

My favorite set of proofs, even from before I read this book, as been Cantor's proofs of the innumerability of the continuum.

I graduated in Mathematics Education, and while I can understand everything, sometimes there are proofs that take a little extra brain power. I recently skipped over the bit about the quadrature of lune because I've never heard of it before, and therefore reading through all the proofs seemed a bit useless to me. Also great--it's a good way to have a mathematical read that doesn't hurt your brain too much."

There are some more chapters I would have liked, e.g. doesn't Euler's identity deserve a full chapter? Does Aristotle or Turing not even deserve a mention in a book of all time greats? Should Cantor get two chapters and Riemann, Godel be pushed in epilogues and special mentions?

My favorite set of proofs, even from before I read this book, as been Cantor's proofs of the innumerability of the continuum. I often show this proof to friends, and was happy that Dunham includes a number of details to this proof that I forgot. Also, I love the section on Archemedes. "

I specifically liked reading about how Archimedes proved the area of a circle and how Limits were introduced as a result of finding the area of irregular shapes.This book is recommended for anyone who has even the slightest interest in Mathematics.

278,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5353883-arun-mahendrakar,5,It felt great reading this book because it took me back to my school days where we learned these concepts/theorems along with their proofs.The book brings history and mathematics together which was an interesting read. I specifically liked reading about how Archimedes proved the area of a circle and how Limits were introduced as a result of finding the area of irregular shapes.This book is recommended for anyone who has even the slightest interest in Mathematics.
279,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8171548-andy-love,4,"I really enjoyed this book, which provides a detailed discussion of a dozen of the great theorems of mathematics, from 400 BC (quadrature of the lune) to the 1900s (transfinite mathematics), complete with a discussion of state of mathematics at the time of the theorem's proof, biographical information about those involved in the proof, and discussion of the mathematics that followed on after the theorem was proved. "
280,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2703844-aaron-phipps,5,"I've read Bell's ""Men of Mathematics"", which I think is a roughly fair comparison to this book, and a noted mathematical classic. ""Journey Through Genius"" presents a dual front of historical context and mathematical excitement, and yet does it in an exhilarating manner. I would skip Bell's ""Men of Mathematics"", which contains much of the same information though without the actual mathematics. I highly recommend this book for anybody interested in mathematics."
281,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300032-keith,5,"If you like math, this book is fantastic. Not only does it cover some of the most famous mathematicians biographies, but it provides some of the very clever and elegant proofs of intractable problems of their times. Considering the level of math known at the time of some of these great people, their creativity and genius shines through. Excellent book for anyone mildly curious about mathematics in general."
282,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4027539-audrey,5,"Read this for a math history class a couple of years ago; I can't say enough good things about this book. It was fascinating, spell-binding, creative, and beautifully written. The math is of course GENIUS. A very understandable book if you made it through high school math, and well worth the read."
283,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9914220-david,5,"Professor Dunham has created a must read for anybody who was frustrated with the college or high school math instruction. This is a book I must add to my personal library. He gave me back the spark of excitement I once had for math, but which got beaten out of me by dozens of less inspired instructors. "
284,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4044163-jackson-cyril,4,"This book takes one from the advent of formal mathematics in Greek times to modernity through examining landmark theorems that have greatly impacted mathematics. The author also provides a splendid study of some of the great mathematicians who discovered these theorems. A good read, and almost all the theorems are readily accessible even without any knowledge of Calculus. "
285,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13935777-gregory,4,"I read this book for my History of Math class. I really enjoyed. I thought it a great introduction to many mathematicians, to some beautiful mathematics, and very accessible even if you are steeped in math all the time. I would highly recommend this book to someone wanting to learn history or about math."
286,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7090625-kellie,5,"I took a course at Portland State University from this man and the text was his book. I LOVED IT!A brief biography, then a telling of the theorem or formula that made the mathematician great.This book is super accessible. One can read it for the interesting bios without needing to read the math and still one would get a lot out of this book. "
287,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6204737-saurabh-shrivastava,5,Pythagoras and Euclid were ~400 years older to Jesus Christ... Geniuses like Newton and Leibniz argued on ownership of a proof... Bernoullis brothers were Liebniz's pupil... Archimedes died being so engrossed in a math puzzle that he didn't acknowledge a Roman soldier.. And many such interesting facts in this history of mathematics... Highly recommended to my engineer buddies 
288,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1860665-taeko,4,"Mention of Paul Cohen was such a nice treat at the end of this book. Reminded me of a lot of my own mathematical education - the latter part of the book from my childhood, and of course the whole span via St. John's. Having the historical context and connection between the mathematicians was engaging. Love being able to take the time to go through the math slowly and in an understandable way."
289,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3326535-mare,5,"Great book, with short and interesting stories from the history of mathematics.I think anyone with high school math degree of knowledge can aunderstand and appreciate ideas and breakthroughs represented in the book. It's not boring or too advance for average reader,but mathematicians can still enjoy it."
290,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278473-mike,3,"If you're not into math to start with, this book probably isn't going to capture your imagination. That being said, the proofs are put forth in a pretty straight-forward manner, and (most of) the history is fascinating."
291,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/609914-john-fowler,0,Dunham presents the history behind some really interesting and influential theorems from western mathematics. He then narrates the theorems that should be understandable to anyone who has completed secondary education.
292,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1737690-daren,3,"Very good exposition of many of the great theorems, for the layman, but at times the stories of the mathematicians could have been made a bit more exciting (as great storytellers can), but as it was, the stories fell a little flat for me."
293,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962244-marc-maxmeister,5,"The first ""character driven"" book about math theorems. Starting in Ancient Greece, Dunham introduces great mathematicians and their ideas in their cultural context up until the present day. It's a page-turner. I quickly order some other math books by the same author!"
294,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3846825-martel-t,5,This book was assigned reading for my Abstract Math course. I loved it and read it through in a couple nights. It's a perfect mix of history and math that doesn't require much mathematical ability. I enjoyed reading the thought processes and proofs for theorems I've started to take for granted.
295,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1311791-arron,5,"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere […] and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. —Bertrand RussellThis is one of the best books I've read on the history of mathematics. Highly recommended. "
296,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20351778-trinity-school-summer-reading,0,"Dunham presents a selection of history’s greatest mathematical gems, from the Pythagorean Theorem to the infinitude of the primes to the different “sizes” of infinity. This book gives a great sense of the role of creativity in the development of mathematics throughout history."
297,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5916868-vicky-liu,5,This book is very dear to me! I was given this in 9th grade by my cousins and I was completely enthralled. I had only taken Algebra 2 at this point but Dunham's clear explanations made each of the theorems/discoveries accessible to me.
298,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/184378-lea,5,I wrote a bunch of my curriculum from this book. Loved it. 
299,014014739X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038809-rebekah,5,Great history of mathematics and important theorems book. Even funny in parts :)
