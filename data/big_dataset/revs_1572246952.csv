0,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4899817-alisa-bowman,5,"This book seemed to want to come into my life. I kept walking past it in the bookstore and it kept coming up as a recommendation on Amazon. Finally one day I broke down and bought it. I was not disappointed. In in, the authors take many of Buddha's teachings and show, through neuroscience, how they change the brain for the better. I've been meditating and studying Dharma for several years, but I still got a lot out of this book. The authors show how certain practices can rewire the brain--helping any of us--even those of us who like to think of ourselves as hopelessly depressed sots--for happiness. They weave science with advice and offer many helpful tips, visualizations and meditations along the way. My favorite chapters were toward the end when the authors teach how to blend assertiveness with compassion--in other words how to love selflessly without being a doormat and also how to be assertive without being rude or mean. The book has invigorated my practice and already changed my outlook for the better."
1,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5163102-nicholas-litterski,5,"Really enjoying this book. It is well-laid out, not overly technical, and has a handy-dandy ""review"" section at the end of each chapter. I'm limiting myself to one chapter/day. I could definitely read it quicker, but that seems to defeat my purpose in reading a book like this. In explaining some of the emerging brain science surrounding motivation, happiness, and (Eastern) Wisdom: it succeeds fantastically. It is a nice mix of Western ""why"" and Eastern ""practice"". Hence ""Practical Neuroscience"". The book offers concrete science behind why meditation works. Though that is immediately useful for me, as useful are other exercises offered as a way of strengthening the beneficial neural networks (the ones that help you relax, make good decisions, feel loving, feel safe) such as using imagery, taking a deep breath, conscious relaxation, etc etc. More than just a list of things to do to relax, though, is the running commentary on what neural systems are involved in these actions. I'm halfway through the book, and will no doubt be relaxing as I read it later today. OM NAMASTE. "

Many of the ideas were familiar, but that did not detract from the book. I liked the combination of neuroscience and meditative techniques. I will attempt to use the techniques in my daily life.""All joy in this world comes from wanting others to be happy, and all suffering in this world comes from wanting only oneself to be happy."" I wish all Goodreaders well!"
3,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23213495-michael,2,"I only have a few things to say about this book. First of all it's heavy on the vocabulary of the brain. It basically gives you a science lesson throughout much of the book. The ""exercises"" in this book are more like tips for using the information. I should warn a lot of you that if you are interested in this book then use the physical copy or eBook and not the audio-book. This is a book that you may want to read slow and write notes in. I fell asleep twice to the audio-book and I'm not sure if that's a reflection on my interest in the material or the science heavy terminology presented in a dry way. You should know that I usually love research heavy material and don't mind a science lesson here or there in most of my reading. Did I get much out of this book? No, not much of anything. There are positives about this book, including the idea of the self and many detailed explanations on things regarding love and hate. I'm sure there were other things in this book that I may have missed that could make a case for a better rating but I don't remember them because the material literally made me fall asleep. I love both Buddhism and Neuroscience but if you're looking for a way to bridge the gap between the two in a way you can understand I'd look elsewhere. There are only a few others and I'll have to check them out to see if there is anything worth reading. My ratings are based on my enjoyment of the material, my drawn interest to the topic and the way it's presented. Clearly there are others who think highly of this book and I respect that, but my experience with this book wasn't incredibly positive. Maybe one day I'll come back to give this one another shot. "

Not to say that you couldn’t enjoy this book if you are a Christian (but you have to take the evolution sections with a grain of salt if that doesn’t fit with your beliefs) or that if you aren’t into science that this will be boring (this is probably the opposite).I really enjoyed the sections that explained why we react the way we do to certain situations and related these back to why our brains developed that way to begin with. While the book was full with the minute details of the inner-working of the brain, the author did a good job of breaking it down and relating it to things we’re more likely to understand.I also really loved that the author even admits to not being perfect about following these steps. He often encourages you to not be upset if you can’t “think” this way, we aren’t meant to. It takes work and practice.My favorite sections were on empathy, attention/concentration, and how to intensify rapture and joy.Full Review Here : http://www.25hourbooks.com/2011/02/bu..."
5,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12392202-vishvapani,3,"Buddha's brain is a model of how to write a self-help book about meditation and science, presenting complex material with outstanding clarity and making it accessible, readable and digestible. It distills the authors’ considerable understanding of both meditation and neuroscience into punchy advice and things that people can actually do. However, I came to it with some doubts about the whole project of expounding meditation in neuro-scientific terms and my response was mixed. Its scientific framework allows it to discuss familiar Buddhist themes and teachings in unfamiliar ways. But, to a large extent, this could be done as an aspect of the much broader effort to explain Buddhist practices in secular and rational terms, and the neuroscience itself offers relatively little fresh understanding of meditation for much of the book.Hanson is clearly a sincere and experienced practitioner and his accounts of his own practice bring another texture to the book. It’s a generous, and intelligent work, whose clarity is all the more remarkable given how new the field really is. That said, it still feels like the beginning of something, and not the last word. "
6,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4627744-frank,3,"I have to say that I was quite disappointed by this book. I bought it after hearing a talk by the author where he presented an introduction to the ideas in the book. I found the lecture interesting but tinged with a little bit of ""the power of positive thinking"" new age evangelism. Much to my chagrin, the same tone was present in the book. I found the scientific evidence presented to be thought provoking but limited and a little over simplistic and I do not know to what extent the research he presents in the book has been validated by robust studies that have replicated the findings. The ideas about how the brain evolved, while somewhat speculative, I found to be the most compelling. For example, the utility of humans having a ""negativity bias"" to insure our survival. I think this can be useful in helping us understand ourselves and giving us distance and objectivity. It makes sense that being hyper vigilant to the negative around us, to danger, was an important survival strategy and that the mind's genetically programmed tendency to orient toward the negative, while once being extremely useful, may no longer be appropriate for us in many situations. To understand this helps us to understand ourselves and gives us a chance to be more conscious and less reactive in our lives. It is these kind of insights that he offers in the book that seem the most grounded and the most in line with Buddhism or Mind-fullness. The emphasis on ""positive thinking"" or positive feeling exercises as a way to shape our minds and generate happiness in our lives had too much of a pop psychology feel to it for my taste and it made it difficult for me to get through the book. I also found this ""striving"" for happiness to be in contradiction to the principles of Mind-fullness as I understand it. I thought the idea was non attachment to outcomes.One of the things I liked about Kabat-Zinn's book ""Full Catastrophe Living"" was that he stated repeatedly that practicing meditation and mindful living did not guarantee a ""happy"" life. There are no promises of material success, good health, love. I believe the idea is that living in the moment, being conscious and aware, is its own reward. Hanson states early in the book that he doesn't think this is enough and he believes that meditative practices can deliver more. I do not think he presents enough of a coherent neuro-scientific argument to support his case. In fairness to the author regarding the ""positive thinking"" angle on it that I noted, I include the following quote from Rick Hanson's blog ""Just One Thing"" on his website:""I don’t believe in positive thinking. You’re not overlooking the pains, losses, or injustices in life. I believe in realistic thinking, seeing the whole mosaic of reality, the good, the bad, and the neutral. Precisely because life is often hard – and because we’ve got a brain that’s relatively poor at growing the inner strengths needed to deal with these challenges – we need to focus on the good facts in life, let them become good experiences, and then help these experiences really sink in."" I have to state that although I do not think that the book shows the science based data on how the practice of mindfulness alters the brain that I was expecting it still has many suggestions for ""self-help"" or mind altering techniques that I have found useful and that other experts in meditation like Thích Nhất Hạnh and Bhante Henepola Gunaratana have written about.  "
7,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina,4,"Buddha's Brain is an amazingly easy, quick read (it took me some time, due to other readings)The book has three main parts: The causes of suffering, Happiness and Love.In the first three chapters, the author goes through basic facts of the brain, how it works, its neurones, how it interacts with the other systems of the body, then come chapter two and three: suffering, what it is, how it happens, how much it can affect you. What I liked the most was the first and second dart part, really interesting.Chapter four to seven were all about hapinness: the benefits of positive thoughts, learning from experiences, how to cool greed and hatred and have strong intentions. The chapter I liked the most was about Equanimity :  ""Equanimity is a perfect, unshakable balance of the mind"" Nyanaponika Thera  how not to react to your reactions, whatever they are, awesome.The last chapters took in compassion, kindness and mindfulness, how to practice them, why, and how much peace they'll bring to you life.The book was written in a great way, mixing science and spiritual materials to make it easier to the reader to understand, a really enjoyable time :)"
8,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949697-thewestchestarian,3,"Less interesting than it sounds. Buddhism distinguishes itself from other religions by accepting the value of science. Hence, writing a book discussing the intersection of Buddhist practices and potential scientific bases for their value, particularly meditation in this case, is a peanut butter and chocolate  fit. The neuroscience will be familiar to anyone with a few neurobiology classes behind them - the singulate gyrus, amygdala, pre-frontal cortex, brain wave variations and other familiar structures are all reviewed in detail. The linking of the functioning of these structures to the practice of mediation makes sense and doesn't require much of a leap of faith to see the support for the practice. Hanson, however, drifts away from the science for a significant portion of the book and some of the concepts fall dangerous close to parody. For example, we meet The Wolf of Love and The Wolf of Hate. Certainly, the concept of your life being influenced by the habits you ""feed"" makes logical sense but spend enough time extending to wolves metaphor to extremes and the discussion eventually just gets silly. Also, ""Loving Kindness"" as a mindset, motivation, resource that exists in metaphysical amounts in an individual's life and the wider universe is a borderline obsession of Hanson in the book. Most problems or shortcomings can be remedied by an application of Loving Kindness. The book also suffers from the general problem of Buddhism not lending itself very well to the written word. Similar to the Dalai Lama's book ""The Universe in a Single Atom"" (), the esoteric nature and talcum powder soft language of Buddhism are difficult to follow for long stretches and certain don't lend themselves to the manner of disjointed and interrupted reading modern audiences practice.  In short, more interesting reviews of neuroscience and Buddhism appear elsewhere but the confluence here is a reasonably good read for someone interested in how they interact. "
9,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4546486-indiegoddess,5,"I don't even know what to say - there's no coherent way I can review this book. It was truly one of the best most helpful books I've ever read, especially in dealing with depression and other mental illnesses. I learned so much from this book: the way my brain has developed, how it works, what helps it work the right way; exercises to calm and still myself. It was like a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) course without the therapists. :) If I weren't reading a Kindle copy it'd be dog-eared and highlighted to the sky, but instead it's just got notes everywhere.I'm putting this book in my favourites pile, and I'll be reading it again really, really soon."
10,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1091417-aj-leblanc,5,"When I’m not being judgmental, cold, cynical, sarcastic, fatalistic, angry, or hopeless, I try to be a better person. Have a positive attitude, practice active kindness, find beauty and good in the world and all that crap.My therapist recommended Buddha’s Brain to me after I tried to explain that I sort of understood that my brain was telling me things that weren’t necessarily true. I understand on a logical level that my brain is trying to keep me alive and to fear change, even though in the long run these changes will be better than what I’m currently doing.Buddha’s Brain is an incredible resource. It starts with the neuroscience of what happens in our bodies when we react to situations. Without being textbook boring, Hanson looks at current (2009) advances in neuroscience and what science is continually learning about the brain. It’s fascinating and helped me understand how biological reactions immediately become emotional responses.Hanson takes his time exploring the brain and giving solid examples of how this biological response becomes emotional response. Even in the heaviest parts of science, he still includes emotional examples. I often found myself thinking “Oh… OK, that’s happened to me. This makes sense.” Logically I understand how emotions can trick me into thinking something is dangerous, but having a neuroscience explanation made me slow down and really think about what my brain was doing to my entire body and how that was then affecting my emotions and behavior.It’s really fascinating and I think people who are turned off by hippie-crunchy dirt worshiping drum circles of healing will respond to the facts and explanation of what is happening in your brain, why evolution has caused this to happen and how it then affects how your body feels.SCIENCE!A big part, if not the biggest part, of changing my attitude and behavior and not letting the cycle of panic and spinning thoughts take me over is practicing mindfulness. And yes, here’s where the people who hate hippie-crunchy dirt worshiping drum circles of healing will cringe. Please trust me when I say that you don’t have to participate in the drum circle. It’s not required.I balked when I was first learning how to be mindful. It felt like a waste of time. Why sit with my thoughts when I already know how I feel? And I don’t WANT to pay attention to how I feel because I feel anxious, panicked, sad and hopeless. Yeah, this sounds like a great idea.However, I slowly came to understand how it works and how it helps. It took me months before my emotional brain shut up for five seconds so my logical brain could process that no, this wasn’t going to kill me. I fought it because I really thought it was a waste of time and energy.But once I let myself just sit, I realized it was actually helpful. Taking time to just sit in the moment and not do anything was OK and usually it was better than OK. I realized that the things I was dwelling on were things I couldn’t do anything about in that moment, so why not pause that out of control voice and just sit and let my mind slow down and only pay attention to what’s happening right now.When I finally understood this, holy shit you guys, it was like taking a huge breath of air after being underwater for a bit too long. I realized my body was in this crazy tense state where my shoulders were pretty much level with my ears, my teeth were clenched, my stomach was tight, my hands were in fists and my brows were furrowed. I didn’t even know I was doing this. I wasn’t even particularly freaked out about anything. I had trained my body to stay in this default setting so I’d be ready when my emotional brain started doing the dance of insanity. Letting my muscles slowly loosen, I was astounded at how tired I felt. I was spending all this energy ready to freak the fuck out, and in this moment of mindfulness I was giving myself permission to calm the fuck down. There was no pressure though. I just sat and breathed and didn’t really think about much other than sitting and breathing.It was awesome.Buddha’s Brain is all about these moments. As Hanson explains the science of our brains he also gives practical examples and guided instructions on how to change what you’re doing and be mindful. There are instructions for many different exercises and you can pick and choose what you want to work on.I hesitate to use the word “instruction” because it sounds like you have to do it a specific way that someone else has come up with, but it’s not like that. This is a framework that you adjust to what works for you. There are parts that push you to go into a different direction, but mindfulness isn’t about having to do it This Way and where everyone does the exact same thing.One thing I really liked about this book is that you can jump around. If you’re not really interested in a part you can skim through it. If it comes up later, Hanson refers you back to that part so if you’re confused, you can go back. If there are practices or guidance for your behavior and thoughts that you’re not interested in, don’t do them. There were a few that made me roll my eyes, but several times I realized that I knew I wasn’t there yet. It’s so much easier to judge and dismiss something that acknowledge that it’s actually helpful but is going to take some work.One of the things I like about mindfulness is that it’s not about being perfect or doing it all the time or following a certain set of rules or having to do it exactly like someone tells you to. You get to figure out for yourself what is working. After awhile you can branch out and try new things. You learn to trust yourself and take those moments to just be. What you’re doing in this moment is enough. If you’re making dinner, why spend extra energy thinking of all the things that need to get done? You’re not going to do them right now, so take a breath and pay attention to how it feels to simply stand at the counter and chop shit up. Take just 60 seconds to think about how that food looks, the feeling of the bowl in your hand, the sounds of the knife against the cutting board, your breath filling your lungs… Yes, you do need to get a bunch of stuff done before going to bed, but right now you’re making dinner and that’s enough. Let it be enough and let yourself just be in that moment.It’s quite amazing.It takes time and practice (which is another reason I fought against it. I want immediate results!) and there are plenty of times where I’m not actively practicing happiness, love and wisdom. Using this book will help you retrain your brain without having to play Hacky Sack, grow dreadlocks and buying a drum for the drum circle. If that’s what you want to do, of course, then let your dreadlocks fly. Please don’t use patchouli though. No one needs to smell that.Get this book. Tag the pages that are interesting to you. (Mine is filled with little sticky flags.) Pick something that seems simple and start doing it. When you feel like you need a little nudge to get back into a better mindset, pick an exercise and practice it. If you feel like you are currently the mindfulness champion of the fucking world, flip through and see if there’s something you haven’t tried yet.It’s an amazing book and I want to buy a copy for pretty much everyone I know. Even if you just flip through it, flip through it. Maybe you’ll get some ideas about how to let yourself quiet those thoughts that never seem to go away."
11,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58826982-imane,5,"“Your brain preferentially scans for, registers, stores, recalls, and reacts to unpleasant experiences, it’s like Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones. Consequently, even when positive experiences outnumber negative ones, the pile of negative implicit memories naturally grows faster. Then the background feeling of what it feels like to be you can become undeservedly glum and pessimistic. Sure, negative experiences do have benefits: loss opens the heart, remorse provides a moral compass, anxiety alerts you to threats, and anger spotlights wrongs that should be righted. For our ancestors, running simulations of past events promoted survival, as it strengthened the learning of successful behaviors by repeating their neural firing patterns. Simulating future events also promoted survival by enabling our ancestors to compare possible outcomes in order to pick the best approach and to ready potential sensory motor sequences for immediate action. But do you really think you’re not having enough negative experiences?! Emotional pain with no benefit to yourself or others is pointless suffering. And pain today breeds more pain tomorrow. For instance, even a single episode of major depression can reshape circuits of the brain to make future episodes more likely (Maletic et al. 2007).”"
12,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126518-jennie,4,"Buddha's Brain is a surprisingly quick, ""easy"" read, using neuroscience to explain why meditation and mindful awareness work to improve your contentment and get over bad experiences. For anyone who has ever dismissed meditation as hippie new age nonsense, or for those of us who just like to know why things work, this book presents the brain as a well-oiled machine: do this or that, and your brain is made to react in a certain way. In a way, it's inspirational; if you're having trouble ""getting somewhere"" with meditation or think that you'll never get over a bad experience, this text would suggest that it's a matter of persistence or a different technique.What I particularly liked about the book is that it has suggested mental exercises (for example, when you're worked up about something, ask yourself what the worst that could happen is, how long the damage would last, how you would cope, who would help you, etc), as well as ""review"" at the end of each chapter that distills the contents to its essential points. They never dumb it down, but the explanations are easy enough to understand for those of us with a degree in law rather than neuroscience.I'm planning on picking up a copy for the next time my stress gets out of control. "
13,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1850913-jeanine-marie-swenson,5,"One of the most difficult things in medicine is to present an incredibly complex subject in readable but simple and understandable language to reach every level of reader. Drs. Hanson and and Mendius do this beautifully and skillfully, to make this nonfictional work blending mind & body both broadly accessible and interesting. I really enjoyed and learned from this uniquely preventative and helpful guide to neuroscience with a gentle, spiritual twist.Recently, you may have read the shocking statistic that one in five or twenty percent of the adult population of the United States has been prescribed psychotropic medication to calm a variety of mental and physical health maladies. Drs. Hanson (neuropsychologist) and Mendius (neurologist) present this alternative, internal strategy for treatment that involves using the mind to change the brain. Blending the primary facets of the meditative traditions of Eastern culture and Buddhism, these kind and compassionate scientists and clinicians suggest a creative blend with Western culture that can lead to a higher level of health, happiness and function. Literally starting at the level of a single neuron, these authors move outward in the anatomic brain to explore the ways cells and then structures connect, communicate and work together to bring about the states we label thought and emotion. Seamlessly blending the most recent brain research with the paradoxes of life on Earth and Buddhist tenets, in the initial chapters the authors explore causes of both desire and suffering. I particularly enjoyed the way the complex and sometimes boring subjects of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology were lightened and summarized usually analogy and metaphor. The authors also use research findings sparingly to emphasize major points, and draw from a broad arch of findings from both individual and systemic psychotherapy. Parts two through four then present ways to cultivate the feelings and social states that encourage happiness, love and wisdom. Using meditative techniques, guided imagery and relaxation methods, the authors present ways to move from uncomfortable and unpleasant states of frustration, anxiety and longing to higher planes of being using ones own inner gifts and pathways. They support the use of these guides with recent brain research that highlight modern explanations for ancient practices. Moving outward from the individual to the family, group and community, Drs. Hanson and Mendius then suggest ways our culture has mirrored the development of the complex brain to promote the highest human states of empathy, compassion and loving attachment. All of this is done in a language that is both nonpathogolizing and nonjudgmental and one that I also feel can mesh well with other faith traditions. While avoiding direct cultural criticism, the astute reader can not help but notice how the authors suggestions seem to directly counter some of our greater culture’s messages of ways to find happiness that include instant gratification, materialism, individualism, selfishness and isolation.This book will interest the highly motivated patient or therapist who is seeking alternative explanations and strategies to blend mind & body to promote connection, sustainable happiness and mindful presence.  "
14,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28000751-arimo,3,"I have very mixed feelings about this book.On a positive note, I really like the theme. Buddha's Brain combines the teachings of Buddhism with neuroscience in a way that I'm really interested in. For me, just following the teachings without justification has never been enough. It was nice to finally hear some explanations for certain practices.The book works as a great toolbox that offers plenty of small exercises for daily life. Buddha's Brain is a quick read, but in this case, reading doesn't mean much. The book has to be experienced and the practices must be put into active use, which takes a lot more time.On the other hand, the book felt uneven. Sometimes, things were argued scientifically, but not all claims were reasoned enough. It feels even dubious that the unscientific and scientific claims are not clearly separated from each other. Now, many readers might believe that all the claims of the book are supported by science, while this is not necessarily the case.I wondered what bugged me so much. Then, a read a review from a friend of mine and he had pointed out what I was missing: self-distance. The writer doesn't show a capability of investigating his own beliefs very critically.I was thinking about giving the book four stars, but then the appendix of the book felt so wrong that it really deteriorated the book as a whole. The appendix doesn't sum up the topics of the book. Instead, the author's wife, an acupuncturist with focus on clinical nutrition writes about ""nutritional neurochemistry"". In a few short pages, she uncritically recommends about a dozen different pills you should take every day to supplement your nutrition.Uh, really?"
15,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901783-happyreader,4,"Where this book may be of benefit is when it focuses on how one mental process can excite or inhibit another mental process. Kind of a book of Buddhist tips with brain anatomy lessons thrown in for scientific authenticity. For instance, if your mind is chattering away, do a body scan or bring a visual image to the forefront since it's difficult to be both visual and verbal at the same time. Yet sometimes all that detail about the brain structure seemed extraneous and sometimes distracting to the message. The fact that our tendency is to focus more on the negative because survival depends more on being aware of dangers may be helpful to realize. Knowing which specific part of my brain is activated is not – unless that part of the brain were suddenly cut out or damaged and then we’ve got an entirely different set of issues to deal with.At the end of the day, this book makes an excellent case for starting and maintaining a mindfulness meditation practice with some helpful, simple tips on improving your practice. With the heavy emphasis on the brain anatomy and bulleted tips, the book is a fast yet choppy read. You may find some of the nuggets about how the brain components work individually illuminating, or not, but the real benefit comes from learning how to practice with the brain in its entirety."
16,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1455162-leslie,3,"This is a very interesting subject for me. This book is serious science, not fluffy new-age nonsense. It is very satisfying for me to learn exactly HOW something happens. I appreciated all the details of the nuts and bolts of neurology,always a fascinating subject. Most importantly the information within this gem is very encouraging. I can set my own self free from worry and depression that has haunted all my life. What little I have learned from other meditation resources so far does indeed work. All without an HMO or any expense at all really. Now that I've finished I'm going to reread Jack Kornfield's very helpful book, ""Meditation for Beginner's"". I have been teaching this stuff in wee bits to my son who has anxiety and anger issues (secondary to Asperger Syndrome). His meds haven't exactly had any lifechanging results either, just take the rough edges off. We are grateful for that but have great confidence that this meditation can be a lifelong help for him too. Sorry for the sloppy typing, the ipad isn't easy to type on and I am so comfy here on the couch under my nice warm Golden Retriever."

I would find my mind wandering away with no clear idea what I had just read. Obviously, I was not managing my Buddha brain while reading. The ideas are good and clear, but it just wasn't inspiring reading for me. Might give it another chance one of these days. I read about seventy-percent of it, so I'm in no real hurry to get back to it, sticking to my philosophy that there is no reason I should finish a book that I'm not that into (especially when it is due back at the library)."

Also, I really found the chapter ""Relaxing the Self"" very useful. Some highlights from it - (1) In many ways, the self is like someone running behind a parade that is already well under way, continually calling out, ""See what I created!"".(2) ""I seem to be a verb"" - Buckminster Fuller(3) Desires often form an 'I' before 'I' forms desires.

21,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875291-tim,4,"Anyone who starts out in contemplative meditation can attest to the often immediate rewards of increased awareness and insight but also to the challenges involved in achieving lasting states of greater virtue, mindfulness and wisdom. Understanding how the physical brain works with the higher spiritual and contemplative states of consciousness can only increase awareness and development. This book is one of the better attempts at looking at how neuroscience is only confirming what the contemplatives have said for thousands of years. Combining the science with the contemplative helps us see why the path can be so challenging yet also provides hope in that both the physical and the spiritual follow the same patterns of reality. The best gains are usually not immediate. Over the past few decades it has been show that the brain can be changed - it does have the feature of neuroplasticity and can exhibit new patterns - and these patterns can be changed within and by choice. Yet these neural connections and patterns are normally the strongest through gradual development, habits, new patterns of thought and associations that are incremental over time. Some reflection and awareness will show that in nearly every area of life we seem to grow in particular directions. It can take you a while to ""get into"" a new book, appreciate a different kind of music or learn a new skill. But once you do, a whole new world opens up and your patterns of thought, interests and motivations seem to find new areas of focus and natural direction. These neural grooves or roads are developed and made more ""permanent"" through the thoughts we have. Concentration of the mind through contemplative practice helps to construct these neural roads and pathways and most importantly gives us greater control over the kinds of pathways we want to construct in the first place. Being kind and compassionate and aware that this is all an ongoing process of development is critically important as well as knowing that the slow changes will be the strongest and lead to the greatest personal improvement. "
22,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3863444-michael-greenwell,3,"This book is a compelling marriage of practical elements of mindfulness and character development from Buddhism with a light neurological overview that allayed my preconceived skepticism of the practices described. I did find myself wondering why some elements were thoroughly referenced and other points simply stated, I understand that it is a book written for the popular press, but while I accept the results of mindfulness and meditative practices both intuitively and practically I don't think this book really explains the interplay between specific acts of mindfulness and the complex neurological structures on which they rely and operate. Despite these concerns I really appreciated seeing this information brought together, having this relationship in the forefront helped me to quell my cynicism and justify the emotional and personal exploration recommended by the book.This book focuses on perception and conception, drawing upon a powerful two part focus of meditative technique and neurological tips. I was periodically stymied by indigestible swathes of flat instruction, unhelpful litanies of steps and perspectives, but more often then not the pacing was reasonable and well supplemented by practical advice on engaging with and sustaining the outlined practices. For myself, this book has provided an interesting survey of mindfulness, a stepping stone from which to evaluate and examine meditative techniques and perspectives to determine which practices will fit within my own life, and hopefully to uncover, nurture, and maintain the calm, centred perspective that is the lure and promise of the practice."
23,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25800231-michele,3,"Read this book slowly, perhaps a chapter a day. I read it all in a couple of days, and that was a mistake because it got tedious and repetitive. If you're familiar with meditation practices, you'll be familiar with most of the practices presented. The neuroscience parts also aren't very detailed or deep, and the studies cited seem to be there just to help justify the benefits of meditative practice and not necessarily provide insight into the inner workings of the brain, which was a bit disappointing to a budding neuroscientist. Alas, this book is for a lay audience! For a person raised in the U.S., I think this book is a good introduction to the mindfulness and inner awareness of the world that is very much lacking in the academy of Western philosophy. But it's still tricky (and maybe morally objectionable) to inject tenets of Buddhist thought into a book that aims to aid the self when Buddhism is about helping all people in their suffering, and not just an individual. Is it commercializing Buddhist philosophy to the masses by taking tiny parts and teaching them without respect to a more holistic understanding? Keep this in mind while reading, if that concerns you at all. Objections aside, if this book can help people infuse a little more happiness into their lives, that's a very good thing and deserving of a positive rating. I found the exercises relaxing and helpful for me, and I hope it will help others as well. "
24,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34191011-marcus-solberg,4,"Very interesting book about what goes on in our brains in regards to happiness, love, and wisdom. The message is that if you can change your brain you will change your life - and you can! The book drawn upon buddhism and mindfulness practices, to which the authors applies cutting edge neuroscience in order to explain different processes and how you can take advantage of them. Neuroplasticity (the fact that our brains change according to how we use them) means that we can form practices (such as meditations etc) and behaviours that will strengthen the neural circuits - and thus also our capacity - for happiness, love, and wisdom.This book was very heavy on the exact parts of the brain, chemicals involved in different complex processes etc. I think that if the authors would have simplified this aspect a bit, it would have made it easier for the reader to remember a bit more of the book. When I think back on some sections of the book, there's just a big jumble of chemical reactions and complex processes in my mind. Other than that, the book was a great and interesting read.Especially recommended for people who are meditating, interested in meditation, or otherwise fascinated by neuroplasticity and how to take advantage of it. "
25,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39991026-michael-harris,5,"Excellent, scientifically sound self-help. If you want to know why neuroscientists can't stop talking about Buddhism and meditation, 10% Happier by Dan Harris is a fun introduction, but Buddha's Brain serves as a foundation for actual practice, especially if – like me – you need to know why something works to feel comfortable diving in. Hanson is a vivid writer, and each chapter is chocked full of subtle practices to boost mindfulness, compassion, and a sense of peace. Albert Einstein: ""The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description....If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism."""
26,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39280424-amy-griffin,2,"This book captured my interest because I thought it would be a nice synthesis between neuroscience and mindfulness/meditation practices. Instead, I found the discussion of neuroscience to be extremely over simplistic and the discussion of mindfulness and Buddhist principles to be confusing and even contradictory. The analogies that the author uses to illustrate concepts sometimes didn't make sense. The book also has a pop psychology feel to it bordering on cheesy. I think it is a good introduction to some if these concepts. The most useful part of the book is an extensive bibliography."
27,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75614199-lindsay,4,"So interesting! Lays out the biological basis of several states of mental health, both positive and negative. Also great advice for small things that you can do during the day to “bias” your brain toward more positive experiences. It does NOT claim that mental illness isn’t “real” or that it can be “fixed” through positive thought. But what is DOES explain is how you are physiologically prone to certain ways of thinking, and how to positively influence those patterns."
28,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81965227-iryna-paprotska,5,"It was for sure worth it :)This is one of those books that can help to grow and steady yourself :)I will definitely take some time off after this book with personal development literature and let it sink.There are so many small tips, even if known, put togather, this is a great mix of information on how brain works and how one can make it work with mindfulness and meditation practice and nutrition "
29,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10514584-kevin-moore,1,"Was looking for an somewhat academic book on the neurology and psychology behind meditation and Buddhist philosophy.

34,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16833555-alyssa-snow,5,Such wonderful insight. Read it. Just do.
35,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"Dr. Rick Hanson explains how your brain functions and how to apply Buddhist techniques to the mind for a more loving, tranquil, and compassionate life. I took so many notes from this one- fantastic read.The highlights:On the connection between the brain and the mind- ""We don't currently understand the relationship between the brain and the mind. A reasonable working hypothesis is the mind is what the brain does."" pg 39One of the best descriptions of the Buddhist path to freedom from suffering that I've ever read- ""If you can break the link between feeling tones and craving- if you can be with the pleasant without chasing after it, with the unpleasant without resisting it, and with the neutral without ignoring it- then you have cut the chain of suffering, at least for a time. And that is an incredible blessing and freedom."" pg 174A precise description of empathy, one that I've not heard before- ""Empathy is a kind of mindfulness meditation focused on someone else's inner world."" pg 207Practical tools to assist yourself in developing closeness with others (if you struggle with such things, like me)- ""Use imagery to encourage yourself to stay in the moment if you are uncomfortable with closeness. See yourself as a tree being blown in the wind of their emotion but you are still there, still grounded when it is over."" pg 212And finally, a description of the self that actually made sense to me- ""The self is a collection of real representations of an unreal being- like a story about a unicorn."" pg 326Dr. Hanson provides lists of exercises and suggested activities in each chapter to increase the positive and decrease the dysfunction of whatever is going on in your mind. The book ends with nutritional supplement suggestions to support healthy brain function and development which I found to be very helpful and written simply so that even non-neuroscientists can understand it.If you enjoyed Buddha's Brain, I'd suggest reading Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by Ricard Matthieu (Matthieu has been described by researchers as the ""happiest man on earth"" and he shares some of his life lessons) and The Wisdom of the Breath: Three Guided Meditations for Calming the Mind and Cultivating Insight by Bodhipaksa (practical exercises for creating and sustaining some of the mind states described in Buddha's Brain)."
36,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17181-jill,3,"3.5, but I think that’s me, not them.I read this book because I have a hyperactive brain, intent on constant improvement of everything around me, including my husband, family, & friends. That is bad juju waiting to happen, all the time. So I’ve been working on slowing down, being content in the moment, focusing on the strengths and positives, and working (slowly) on starting a daily meditation practice. (I suck at this so hard.)if you know you need to slow down/focus/meditate, are avoidant like me, and need a factual science grounding for the Why, this is a decent place to start. Authors are an MD and a neurologist, with long meditation practice, and they reference modern research that supports their positions. The book starts with anatomy and physiology of the brain, why its parts do what they do, and then moves into how we can consciously support better minds on top of that brain topography by being mindful. It’s not a book that will do much if you speed through it, I suspect— there’s a lot to reflect on, and practice. I didn’t love all of the practice examples, but again: that’s me and my resistance. It’s worth checking out, paired with other helpful tools, like a great therapist. :D"
37,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5523645-irene,4,"In the beginning I was somewhat turned off by what I interpreted as the author's attempt to use neuroscience and psychology as a vehicle to ""prove"" the legitimacy of Buddhism. It was annoying, particularly coming from someone claiming to to have some scientific background. As the book continues however, it pays less homage to Buddhism and more to neuroscience. I find it a very illuminating book with practical suggestions as to practices which might help in the attainment of happiness.In the last section titled ""Wisdom"", some of the explanations are less than sufficient. Author starts talking about ""mind objects"" without ever explaining what they are. This part of the book seems to be more of a summary than anything new. I feel like the author got a little lazy here and just started glossing over things. Or perhaps the level of enlightenment he is trying to describe is too advanced a concept to be covered within one brief section.In summary, I found it interesting possibly because I have some background in neuropsychology. I am somewhat of a newcomer to meditation. It could probably be viewed as a very basic primer in both, but helpful no doubt."
38,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,3,"The sub-title of this book describes it's content and purpose: ""The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love & Wisdom."" Rick Hanson is a neuropsychologist and meditation teacher, and he does a good job explaining in lay-person's terms the neurological anatomy and functioning of the brain behind the effects of meditation.The strength of this book is that it doesn't merely tell you what parts of the brain are involved in various functions like decision making, impulse inhibition, and emotions such as happiness, love, equanimity, fear and anger, he offers practices designed to affect the brain, cultivating wholesome emotions and lessening those that are unwholesome.The weakness of the book is that I'm not sure who will most benefit from this book as written. If you are someone interested in and up-to-date on neuroscience, there's not a lot you'll learn here (unless you know the science but have never been instructed in the meditation techniques) and if you are not interested in the science, you'll find it overly technical and maybe even boring!"
39,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1504839-patricia,5,"I was delighted to find a book that mixes modern science with an age old tradition. The science is extremely clear and readable, and Hanson offers so many practical suggestions, some of which are quite fresh, giving the book added value. The practice of ""taking in the good"" is among my favorites and it alone was worth the price of the book. His guidelines for effective communication, based as they are on compassion AND how our brains work, expanded my understanding of reflective listening and greatly refined the way I want to implement the expressive side of the equation. This chapter was probably the most powerful for me in terms of adjusting a long time understanding. As I read this book, I also listened to the 7 part series called The Compassionate Brain that Hansen offers through Sounds True. The combination of the book and video series was quite effective. I felt my Buddha brain growing inside my skull (and my heart). This book will surely become a frequently consulted reference."
40,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954066-eric-pelot,2,"I have a lot of books on my reading list from recommendations given on KurzweilAI.net... this is one of those books. I've sort of been reading all the recommendations wholesale without any pre-screeing. I think that's going to have to change. This is the second book in the same number of weeks that was really more about self-help than about science/technology/futurism... which I was expecting from a recommendation made by that site. I guess I can see the tie-in with the bit of neuroscience that this book included... but in all, this was not my sort of thing. That said, this is not a BAD book in general... and quite good if you are interested in applying the latest knowledge gleaned from neuroscience (mixed with Buddhism) towards your own self-improvement/happiness. I'm just not interested in those things, so this book wasn't for me. "
41,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/229806-mads-p,3,"I enjoyed the talks on wisdom, love and happiness here, but those came after wading through all the technical talk about the brain. I'm glad doctors and scientists are learning more about which parts of the brain do what, but I'm not that interested in those types of anatomical specifics. I would have liked more detailed descriptions of the nature of mind and the different types of meditation. They get into this, but another source might be better if you want to go deep into the subject of meditation itself. There are several good meditation exercises included. I think to do them effectively one would need to first make a recording while reading them aloud and then play them back. Pema Chodron's audio lectures and meditation exercises seem to be a better way to learn and practice and I'd rather listen to her than myself. However, I'll probably keep this on hand as a reference. "
42,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11883771-saul-chan-htoo-sang,3,"I read this book for a class.The book examines the way humans experience sadness and argues that most of the time people get sad because they are innately (biologically) susceptible to be sad. In other words, we get sad because it is easy to be sad (thanks to the evolutionary traits left by our ancestors). Moreover, after examining the roots of sadness, the book suggests certain practices such as compassion, kindness, and lovingness, which are drawn from the Buddhist philosophical tradition, to be joyful in life. Recommended to those who are willing to learn about how our brains work and how we can reduce suffering and increase happiness in a scientific way based on spiritual frameworks.P.S. If you want to learn about Buddha's philosophy, this is not the book you wanna be reading. It talks only a few times of Buddha's teachings.  "
43,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6891202-sisi,4,"I found this book because after taking a Yale class on the science of happiness online, I was hungry for more information regarding the science of our brains and how a lifetime practice of meditation actually changed the physical matter of our brain. This book delivers that, but also took me through how connected our brains are to our bodies, and how some systems (our brain signaling something like fear to the body and our body reacts physically) can be reverse “hacked” in a way — we can essentially control our bodies to act calm, and the brain will follow. Hence, one of the biggest uses of meditation to help us be calmer. The first chapter of this book was slow, but after that it’s really fascinating. It’s even helped me handle a minor personal conflict in a more mature and emotionally healthy way! Definitely recommend. "
44,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3524795-sarah-booth,4,"A very insightful book about how meditation and the practice of Buddhist monks affects the brain. One needs not be a Buddhist monk to enjoy the benefits that meditation brings. This book is very technical at times to show you what is happening in the brain, but does a good job explaining it and then moves on to explain what it all means relative to what is going on in your brain or the brain of one who meditates. So far it's a great book, but it does require you to pay attention. Some books you can fade in and out of listening, but I find myself going back over things as I reallly want to learn more and understand perfectly what is being discuessed. great book. "
45,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71834000-castles,2,"I’ve been waiting to read this book for a long time but found it rather disappointing. Maybe I was a bit out of focus after reading a very long book before it, but I couldn’t really concentrate on most of the text. There are so much better books out there about mindfulness, meditation, psychology and the brain, but I think this one is actually one of the first in this new wave of those (am I wrong?). There’s really nothing bad about this book but even though it’s always pleasant to read about this subject, this one didn’t catch my attention like many other books about the same subjects did. And what's up with that vitamin catalog at the end of the book?"
46,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3688618-steve-woods,5,"This is the most important book I have ever read, maybe I feel that way because of all the practical meditation and reading on the Buddhist path I have done so it's timely. It gives a scientific and physiological basis for understanding all the changes that have taken place in my life. While demystifying it all, the Buddha never claimed that it was anything but totally human,it just strengthens my resolve with the understanding that it's all real and that the benefits promised are a physiological fact. Put in the footwork and these things will happen."
47,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2975029-eohlson,3,"Like ""The Winner's Brain"" (TWB) this might be more interesting to people that haven't read so many other brain books. (I still like ""Brain Rules"" the best.) Also like TWB, it's a recent book, so lots of new research is referenced. I actually picked this book up for the meditation exercises, since it was mentioned in TWB that meditation increases the thickness of the cortex. (Also mentioned in ""Buddha's Brain"".)So I'm bumping this to a 3 star rating since I think that better reflects how the standard reader would feel about the book."
48,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689274-libby,4,"This interesting book details the neuroscience of how our brains are wired--e.g., we are hardwired to veer toward the negative because the primitive part of our brain was originally on the lookout for danger (essential to our continued survival). However, we don't have to be held hostage to this: we can take active steps to change our brains and be happier. There is also an appendix that lists and describes vitamin supplementation that can enhance our brain's functioning."

I took so many notes from this one- fantastic read.The highlights:On the connection between the brain and the mind- ""We don't currently understand the relationship between the brain and the mind. A reasonable working hypothesis is the mind is what the brain does."" pg 39One of the best descriptions of the Buddhist path to freedom from suffering that I've ever read- ""If you can break the link between feeling tones and craving- if you can be with the pleasant without chasing after it, with the unpleasant without resisting it, and with the neutral without ignoring it- then you have cut the chain of suffering, at least for a time. And that is an incredible blessing and freedom."" pg 174A precise description of empathy, one that I've not heard before- ""Empathy is a kind of mindfulness meditation focused on someone else's inner world."" pg 207Practical tools to assist yourself in developing closeness with others (if you struggle with such things, like me)- ""Use imagery to encourage yourself to stay in the moment if you are uncomfortable with closeness. See yourself as a tree being blown in the wind of their emotion but you are still there, still grounded when it is over."" pg 212And finally, a description of the self that actually made sense to me- ""The self is a collection of real representations of an unreal being- like a story about a unicorn."" pg 326Dr. Hanson provides lists of exercises and suggested activities in each chapter to increase the positive and decrease the dysfunction of whatever is going on in your mind. The book ends with nutritional supplement suggestions to support healthy brain function and development which I found to be very helpful and written simply so that even non-neuroscientists can understand it.If you enjoyed Buddha's Brain, I'd suggest reading Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by Ricard Matthieu (Matthieu has been described by researchers as the ""happiest man on earth"" and he shares some of his life lessons) and The Wisdom of the Breath: Three Guided Meditations for Calming the Mind and Cultivating Insight by Bodhipaksa (practical exercises for creating and sustaining some of the mind states described in Buddha's Brain)."

That is bad juju waiting to happen, all the time. So I’ve been working on slowing down, being content in the moment, focusing on the strengths and positives, and working (slowly) on starting a daily meditation practice. (I suck at this so hard.)if you know you need to slow down/focus/meditate, are avoidant like me, and need a factual science grounding for the Why, this is a decent place to start. Authors are an MD and a neurologist, with long meditation practice, and they reference modern research that supports their positions. The book starts with anatomy and physiology of the brain, why its parts do what they do, and then moves into how we can consciously support better minds on top of that brain topography by being mindful. It’s not a book that will do much if you speed through it, I suspect— there’s a lot to reflect on, and practice. I didn’t love all of the practice examples, but again: that’s me and my resistance. It’s worth checking out, paired with other helpful tools, like a great therapist. :D"

I find it a very illuminating book with practical suggestions as to practices which might help in the attainment of happiness.In the last section titled ""Wisdom"", some of the explanations are less than sufficient. Author starts talking about ""mind objects"" without ever explaining what they are. This part of the book seems to be more of a summary than anything new. I feel like the author got a little lazy here and just started glossing over things. Or perhaps the level of enlightenment he is trying to describe is too advanced a concept to be covered within one brief section.In summary, I found it interesting possibly because I have some background in neuropsychology.

68,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,3,"The sub-title of this book describes it's content and purpose: ""The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love & Wisdom."" Rick Hanson is a neuropsychologist and meditation teacher, and he does a good job explaining in lay-person's terms the neurological anatomy and functioning of the brain behind the effects of meditation.The strength of this book is that it doesn't merely tell you what parts of the brain are involved in various functions like decision making, impulse inhibition, and emotions such as happiness, love, equanimity, fear and anger, he offers practices designed to affect the brain, cultivating wholesome emotions and lessening those that are unwholesome.The weakness of the book is that I'm not sure who will most benefit from this book as written. If you are someone interested in and up-to-date on neuroscience, there's not a lot you'll learn here (unless you know the science but have never been instructed in the meditation techniques) and if you are not interested in the science, you'll find it overly technical and maybe even boring!"
69,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1504839-patricia,5,"I was delighted to find a book that mixes modern science with an age old tradition. The science is extremely clear and readable, and Hanson offers so many practical suggestions, some of which are quite fresh, giving the book added value. The practice of ""taking in the good"" is among my favorites and it alone was worth the price of the book. His guidelines for effective communication, based as they are on compassion AND how our brains work, expanded my understanding of reflective listening and greatly refined the way I want to implement the expressive side of the equation. This chapter was probably the most powerful for me in terms of adjusting a long time understanding. As I read this book, I also listened to the 7 part series called The Compassionate Brain that Hansen offers through Sounds True. The combination of the book and video series was quite effective. I felt my Buddha brain growing inside my skull (and my heart). This book will surely become a frequently consulted reference."
70,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954066-eric-pelot,2,"I have a lot of books on my reading list from recommendations given on KurzweilAI.net... this is one of those books. I've sort of been reading all the recommendations wholesale without any pre-screeing. I think that's going to have to change. This is the second book in the same number of weeks that was really more about self-help than about science/technology/futurism... which I was expecting from a recommendation made by that site. I guess I can see the tie-in with the bit of neuroscience that this book included... but in all, this was not my sort of thing. That said, this is not a BAD book in general... and quite good if you are interested in applying the latest knowledge gleaned from neuroscience (mixed with Buddhism) towards your own self-improvement/happiness. I'm just not interested in those things, so this book wasn't for me. "
71,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/229806-mads-p,3,"I enjoyed the talks on wisdom, love and happiness here, but those came after wading through all the technical talk about the brain. I'm glad doctors and scientists are learning more about which parts of the brain do what, but I'm not that interested in those types of anatomical specifics. I would have liked more detailed descriptions of the nature of mind and the different types of meditation. They get into this, but another source might be better if you want to go deep into the subject of meditation itself. There are several good meditation exercises included. I think to do them effectively one would need to first make a recording while reading them aloud and then play them back. Pema Chodron's audio lectures and meditation exercises seem to be a better way to learn and practice and I'd rather listen to her than myself. However, I'll probably keep this on hand as a reference. "
72,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11883771-saul-chan-htoo-sang,3,"I read this book for a class.The book examines the way humans experience sadness and argues that most of the time people get sad because they are innately (biologically) susceptible to be sad. In other words, we get sad because it is easy to be sad (thanks to the evolutionary traits left by our ancestors). Moreover, after examining the roots of sadness, the book suggests certain practices such as compassion, kindness, and lovingness, which are drawn from the Buddhist philosophical tradition, to be joyful in life. Recommended to those who are willing to learn about how our brains work and how we can reduce suffering and increase happiness in a scientific way based on spiritual frameworks.P.S. If you want to learn about Buddha's philosophy, this is not the book you wanna be reading. It talks only a few times of Buddha's teachings.  "
73,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6891202-sisi,4,"I found this book because after taking a Yale class on the science of happiness online, I was hungry for more information regarding the science of our brains and how a lifetime practice of meditation actually changed the physical matter of our brain. This book delivers that, but also took me through how connected our brains are to our bodies, and how some systems (our brain signaling something like fear to the body and our body reacts physically) can be reverse “hacked” in a way — we can essentially control our bodies to act calm, and the brain will follow. Hence, one of the biggest uses of meditation to help us be calmer. The first chapter of this book was slow, but after that it’s really fascinating. It’s even helped me handle a minor personal conflict in a more mature and emotionally healthy way! Definitely recommend. "
74,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3524795-sarah-booth,4,"A very insightful book about how meditation and the practice of Buddhist monks affects the brain. One needs not be a Buddhist monk to enjoy the benefits that meditation brings. This book is very technical at times to show you what is happening in the brain, but does a good job explaining it and then moves on to explain what it all means relative to what is going on in your brain or the brain of one who meditates. So far it's a great book, but it does require you to pay attention. Some books you can fade in and out of listening, but I find myself going back over things as I reallly want to learn more and understand perfectly what is being discuessed. great book. "
75,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71834000-castles,2,"I’ve been waiting to read this book for a long time but found it rather disappointing. Maybe I was a bit out of focus after reading a very long book before it, but I couldn’t really concentrate on most of the text. There are so much better books out there about mindfulness, meditation, psychology and the brain, but I think this one is actually one of the first in this new wave of those (am I wrong?). There’s really nothing bad about this book but even though it’s always pleasant to read about this subject, this one didn’t catch my attention like many other books about the same subjects did. And what's up with that vitamin catalog at the end of the book?"
76,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3688618-steve-woods,5,"This is the most important book I have ever read, maybe I feel that way because of all the practical meditation and reading on the Buddhist path I have done so it's timely. It gives a scientific and physiological basis for understanding all the changes that have taken place in my life. While demystifying it all, the Buddha never claimed that it was anything but totally human,it just strengthens my resolve with the understanding that it's all real and that the benefits promised are a physiological fact. Put in the footwork and these things will happen."
77,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2975029-eohlson,3,"Like ""The Winner's Brain"" (TWB) this might be more interesting to people that haven't read so many other brain books. (I still like ""Brain Rules"" the best.) Also like TWB, it's a recent book, so lots of new research is referenced. I actually picked this book up for the meditation exercises, since it was mentioned in TWB that meditation increases the thickness of the cortex. (Also mentioned in ""Buddha's Brain"".)So I'm bumping this to a 3 star rating since I think that better reflects how the standard reader would feel about the book."

In other words, we get sad because it is easy to be sad (thanks to the evolutionary traits left by our ancestors). Moreover, after examining the roots of sadness, the book suggests certain practices such as compassion, kindness, and lovingness, which are drawn from the Buddhist philosophical tradition, to be joyful in life. Recommended to those who are willing to learn about how our brains work and how we can reduce suffering and increase happiness in a scientific way based on spiritual frameworks.P.S.

This book is very technical at times to show you what is happening in the brain, but does a good job explaining it and then moves on to explain what it all means relative to what is going on in your brain or the brain of one who meditates. So far it's a great book, but it does require you to pay attention.

125,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"Dr. Rick Hanson explains how your brain functions and how to apply Buddhist techniques to the mind for a more loving, tranquil, and compassionate life. I took so many notes from this one- fantastic read.The highlights:On the connection between the brain and the mind- ""We don't currently understand the relationship between the brain and the mind. A reasonable working hypothesis is the mind is what the brain does."" pg 39One of the best descriptions of the Buddhist path to freedom from suffering that I've ever read- ""If you can break the link between feeling tones and craving- if you can be with the pleasant without chasing after it, with the unpleasant without resisting it, and with the neutral without ignoring it- then you have cut the chain of suffering, at least for a time. And that is an incredible blessing and freedom."" pg 174A precise description of empathy, one that I've not heard before- ""Empathy is a kind of mindfulness meditation focused on someone else's inner world."" pg 207Practical tools to assist yourself in developing closeness with others (if you struggle with such things, like me)- ""Use imagery to encourage yourself to stay in the moment if you are uncomfortable with closeness. See yourself as a tree being blown in the wind of their emotion but you are still there, still grounded when it is over."" pg 212And finally, a description of the self that actually made sense to me- ""The self is a collection of real representations of an unreal being- like a story about a unicorn."" pg 326Dr. Hanson provides lists of exercises and suggested activities in each chapter to increase the positive and decrease the dysfunction of whatever is going on in your mind. The book ends with nutritional supplement suggestions to support healthy brain function and development which I found to be very helpful and written simply so that even non-neuroscientists can understand it.If you enjoyed Buddha's Brain, I'd suggest reading Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by Ricard Matthieu (Matthieu has been described by researchers as the ""happiest man on earth"" and he shares some of his life lessons) and The Wisdom of the Breath: Three Guided Meditations for Calming the Mind and Cultivating Insight by Bodhipaksa (practical exercises for creating and sustaining some of the mind states described in Buddha's Brain)."
126,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17181-jill,3,"3.5, but I think that’s me, not them.I read this book because I have a hyperactive brain, intent on constant improvement of everything around me, including my husband, family, & friends. That is bad juju waiting to happen, all the time. So I’ve been working on slowing down, being content in the moment, focusing on the strengths and positives, and working (slowly) on starting a daily meditation practice. (I suck at this so hard.)if you know you need to slow down/focus/meditate, are avoidant like me, and need a factual science grounding for the Why, this is a decent place to start. Authors are an MD and a neurologist, with long meditation practice, and they reference modern research that supports their positions. The book starts with anatomy and physiology of the brain, why its parts do what they do, and then moves into how we can consciously support better minds on top of that brain topography by being mindful. It’s not a book that will do much if you speed through it, I suspect— there’s a lot to reflect on, and practice. I didn’t love all of the practice examples, but again: that’s me and my resistance. It’s worth checking out, paired with other helpful tools, like a great therapist. :D"
127,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5523645-irene,4,"In the beginning I was somewhat turned off by what I interpreted as the author's attempt to use neuroscience and psychology as a vehicle to ""prove"" the legitimacy of Buddhism. It was annoying, particularly coming from someone claiming to to have some scientific background. As the book continues however, it pays less homage to Buddhism and more to neuroscience. I find it a very illuminating book with practical suggestions as to practices which might help in the attainment of happiness.In the last section titled ""Wisdom"", some of the explanations are less than sufficient. Author starts talking about ""mind objects"" without ever explaining what they are. This part of the book seems to be more of a summary than anything new. I feel like the author got a little lazy here and just started glossing over things. Or perhaps the level of enlightenment he is trying to describe is too advanced a concept to be covered within one brief section.In summary, I found it interesting possibly because I have some background in neuropsychology. I am somewhat of a newcomer to meditation. It could probably be viewed as a very basic primer in both, but helpful no doubt."
128,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,3,"The sub-title of this book describes it's content and purpose: ""The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love & Wisdom.""

If you are someone interested in and up-to-date on neuroscience, there's not a lot you'll learn here (unless you know the science but have never been instructed in the meditation techniques) and if you are not interested in the science, you'll find it overly technical and maybe even boring!"

A reasonable working hypothesis is the mind is what the brain does."" pg 39One of the best descriptions of the Buddhist path to freedom from suffering that I've ever read- ""If you can break the link between feeling tones and craving- if you can be with the pleasant without chasing after it, with the unpleasant without resisting it, and with the neutral without ignoring it- then you have cut the chain of suffering, at least for a time. And that is an incredible blessing and freedom."" pg 174A precise description of empathy, one that I've not heard before- ""Empathy is a kind of mindfulness meditation focused on someone else's inner world."" pg 207Practical tools to assist yourself in developing closeness with others (if you struggle with such things, like me)- ""Use imagery to encourage yourself to stay in the moment if you are uncomfortable with closeness. See yourself as a tree being blown in the wind of their emotion but you are still there, still grounded when it is over."" pg 212And finally, a description of the self that actually made sense to me- ""The self is a collection of real representations of an unreal being- like a story about a unicorn."" pg 326Dr. Hanson provides lists of exercises and suggested activities in each chapter to increase the positive and decrease the dysfunction of whatever is going on in your mind. The book ends with nutritional supplement suggestions to support healthy brain function and development which I found to be very helpful and written simply so that even non-neuroscientists can understand it.If you enjoyed Buddha's Brain, I'd suggest reading Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by Ricard Matthieu (Matthieu has been described by researchers as the ""happiest man on earth"" and he shares some of his life lessons) and The Wisdom of the Breath: Three Guided Meditations for Calming the Mind and Cultivating Insight by Bodhipaksa (practical exercises for creating and sustaining some of the mind states described in Buddha's Brain)."

That is bad juju waiting to happen, all the time. So I’ve been working on slowing down, being content in the moment, focusing on the strengths and positives, and working (slowly) on starting a daily meditation practice.

Authors are an MD and a neurologist, with long meditation practice, and they reference modern research that supports their positions. The book starts with anatomy and physiology of the brain, why its parts do what they do, and then moves into how we can consciously support better minds on top of that brain topography by being mindful. It’s not a book that will do much if you speed through it, I suspect— there’s a lot to reflect on, and practice. I didn’t love all of the practice examples, but again: that’s me and my resistance.

I find it a very illuminating book with practical suggestions as to practices which might help in the attainment of happiness.In the last section titled ""Wisdom"", some of the explanations are less than sufficient. Author starts talking about ""mind objects"" without ever explaining what they are. This part of the book seems to be more of a summary than anything new. I feel like the author got a little lazy here and just started glossing over things. Or perhaps the level of enlightenment he is trying to describe is too advanced a concept to be covered within one brief section.In summary, I found it interesting possibly because I have some background in neuropsychology.

If you are someone interested in and up-to-date on neuroscience, there's not a lot you'll learn here (unless you know the science but have never been instructed in the meditation techniques) and if you are not interested in the science, you'll find it overly technical and maybe even boring!"

They get into this, but another source might be better if you want to go deep into the subject of meditation itself. There are several good meditation exercises included. I think to do them effectively one would need to first make a recording while reading them aloud and then play them back. Pema Chodron's audio lectures and meditation exercises seem to be a better way to learn and practice and I'd rather listen to her than myself. However, I'll probably keep this on hand as a reference.

162,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11883771-saul-chan-htoo-sang,3,"I read this book for a class.The book examines the way humans experience sadness and argues that most of the time people get sad because they are innately (biologically) susceptible to be sad. In other words, we get sad because it is easy to be sad (thanks to the evolutionary traits left by our ancestors). Moreover, after examining the roots of sadness, the book suggests certain practices such as compassion, kindness, and lovingness, which are drawn from the Buddhist philosophical tradition, to be joyful in life. Recommended to those who are willing to learn about how our brains work and how we can reduce suffering and increase happiness in a scientific way based on spiritual frameworks.P.S. If you want to learn about Buddha's philosophy, this is not the book you wanna be reading. It talks only a few times of Buddha's teachings.  "
163,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6891202-sisi,4,"I found this book because after taking a Yale class on the science of happiness online, I was hungry for more information regarding the science of our brains and how a lifetime practice of meditation actually changed the physical matter of our brain. This book delivers that, but also took me through how connected our brains are to our bodies, and how some systems (our brain signaling something like fear to the body and our body reacts physically) can be reverse “hacked” in a way — we can essentially control our bodies to act calm, and the brain will follow. Hence, one of the biggest uses of meditation to help us be calmer. The first chapter of this book was slow, but after that it’s really fascinating. It’s even helped me handle a minor personal conflict in a more mature and emotionally healthy way! Definitely recommend. "
164,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3524795-sarah-booth,4,"A very insightful book about how meditation and the practice of Buddhist monks affects the brain. One needs not be a Buddhist monk to enjoy the benefits that meditation brings. This book is very technical at times to show you what is happening in the brain, but does a good job explaining it and then moves on to explain what it all means relative to what is going on in your brain or the brain of one who meditates. So far it's a great book, but it does require you to pay attention. Some books you can fade in and out of listening, but I find myself going back over things as I reallly want to learn more and understand perfectly what is being discuessed. great book. "
165,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71834000-castles,2,"I’ve been waiting to read this book for a long time but found it rather disappointing. Maybe I was a bit out of focus after reading a very long book before it, but I couldn’t really concentrate on most of the text. There are so much better books out there about mindfulness, meditation, psychology and the brain, but I think this one is actually one of the first in this new wave of those (am I wrong?). There’s really nothing bad about this book but even though it’s always pleasant to read about this subject, this one didn’t catch my attention like many other books about the same subjects did. And what's up with that vitamin catalog at the end of the book?"
166,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3688618-steve-woods,5,"This is the most important book I have ever read, maybe I feel that way because of all the practical meditation and reading on the Buddhist path I have done so it's timely. It gives a scientific and physiological basis for understanding all the changes that have taken place in my life. While demystifying it all, the Buddha never claimed that it was anything but totally human,it just strengthens my resolve with the understanding that it's all real and that the benefits promised are a physiological fact. Put in the footwork and these things will happen."
167,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2975029-eohlson,3,"Like ""The Winner's Brain"" (TWB) this might be more interesting to people that haven't read so many other brain books. (I still like ""Brain Rules"" the best.) Also like TWB, it's a recent book, so lots of new research is referenced. I actually picked this book up for the meditation exercises, since it was mentioned in TWB that meditation increases the thickness of the cortex. (Also mentioned in ""Buddha's Brain"".)So I'm bumping this to a 3 star rating since I think that better reflects how the standard reader would feel about the book."
168,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689274-libby,4,"This interesting book details the neuroscience of how our brains are wired--e.g., we are hardwired to veer toward the negative because the primitive part of our brain was originally on the lookout for danger (essential to our continued survival). However, we don't have to be held hostage to this: we can take active steps to change our brains and be happier. There is also an appendix that lists and describes vitamin supplementation that can enhance our brain's functioning."

I'm a science nerd but also a very spiritual person - so this book was the perfect intersection of these two fields for me. It gave me a good scientific understanding of how spiritual practices are positive from a neuroscience perspective as well. It's not extremely detailed scientifically and uses some vague, evocative language to describe emotions etc that may not appeal to the overly ""rational"" minds. "
170,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5440048-lindsay,2,"This book is written by a scientist who tries to publish a book about self-help. It doesn't work. His vocabulary doesn't fit a typical self-help book, his writing style is kinda dry. While the title says ""Buddha's Brain"", most of the book is not about Buddhism but more about how the brain works and some very simple meditations. Maybe perfect for those who are new to mindfulness but nothing useful for those with more experience. "
171,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50780835-yuekun-liu,3,"The book may be more attractive to those who have some basic knowledge in neuroscience. To be honest, the terminologies on brain structure are a little bit disturbing to me. Maybe I am not open-minded enough to embrace this new knowledge. Well, the figures there are very clear indeed. The other thing I learn from the book is to love yourself and love others. And hope to practice to be mindful, which is a real challenge to me. lol. "
172,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49794435-sarah-goss,4,"""Buddha's Brain"" is more of a book on neuroscience than a book of Buddhist philosophy. Although it is somewhat repetitive of other neuroscience books, as many popular science-minded books are, the angle from which it is told brings a fresh analysis of purpose-driven suffering, and why a forward-thinking mindset toward acceptance, forgiveness, and living life to the fullest is a healthy approach to mental wellness."

Moreover, after examining the roots of sadness, the book suggests certain practices such as compassion, kindness, and lovingness, which are drawn from the Buddhist philosophical tradition, to be joyful in life. Recommended to those who are willing to learn about how our brains work and how we can reduce suffering and increase happiness in a scientific way based on spiritual frameworks.P.S.

This book is very technical at times to show you what is happening in the brain, but does a good job explaining it and then moves on to explain what it all means relative to what is going on in your brain or the brain of one who meditates.

I took so many notes from this one- fantastic read.The highlights:On the connection between the brain and the mind- ""We don't currently understand the relationship between the brain and the mind. A reasonable working hypothesis is the mind is what the brain does."" pg 39One of the best descriptions of the Buddhist path to freedom from suffering that I've ever read- ""If you can break the link between feeling tones and craving- if you can be with the pleasant without chasing after it, with the unpleasant without resisting it, and with the neutral without ignoring it- then you have cut the chain of suffering, at least for a time. And that is an incredible blessing and freedom."" pg 174A precise description of empathy, one that I've not heard before- ""Empathy is a kind of mindfulness meditation focused on someone else's inner world."" pg 207Practical tools to assist yourself in developing closeness with others (if you struggle with such things, like me)- ""Use imagery to encourage yourself to stay in the moment if you are uncomfortable with closeness. See yourself as a tree being blown in the wind of their emotion but you are still there, still grounded when it is over."" pg 212And finally, a description of the self that actually made sense to me- ""The self is a collection of real representations of an unreal being- like a story about a unicorn."" pg 326Dr. Hanson provides lists of exercises and suggested activities in each chapter to increase the positive and decrease the dysfunction of whatever is going on in your mind. The book ends with nutritional supplement suggestions to support healthy brain function and development which I found to be very helpful and written simply so that even non-neuroscientists can understand it.If you enjoyed Buddha's Brain, I'd suggest reading Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by Ricard Matthieu (Matthieu has been described by researchers as the ""happiest man on earth"" and he shares some of his life lessons) and The Wisdom of the Breath: Three Guided Meditations for Calming the Mind and Cultivating Insight by Bodhipaksa (practical exercises for creating and sustaining some of the mind states described in Buddha's Brain)."
216,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17181-jill,3,"3.5, but I think that’s me, not them.I read this book because I have a hyperactive brain, intent on constant improvement of everything around me, including my husband, family, & friends. That is bad juju waiting to happen, all the time. So I’ve been working on slowing down, being content in the moment, focusing on the strengths and positives, and working (slowly) on starting a daily meditation practice. (I suck at this so hard.)if you know you need to slow down/focus/meditate, are avoidant like me, and need a factual science grounding for the Why, this is a decent place to start. Authors are an MD and a neurologist, with long meditation practice, and they reference modern research that supports their positions. The book starts with anatomy and physiology of the brain, why its parts do what they do, and then moves into how we can consciously support better minds on top of that brain topography by being mindful. It’s not a book that will do much if you speed through it, I suspect— there’s a lot to reflect on, and practice. I didn’t love all of the practice examples, but again: that’s me and my resistance. It’s worth checking out, paired with other helpful tools, like a great therapist. :D"
217,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5523645-irene,4,"In the beginning I was somewhat turned off by what I interpreted as the author's attempt to use neuroscience and psychology as a vehicle to ""prove"" the legitimacy of Buddhism. It was annoying, particularly coming from someone claiming to to have some scientific background. As the book continues however, it pays less homage to Buddhism and more to neuroscience. I find it a very illuminating book with practical suggestions as to practices which might help in the attainment of happiness.In the last section titled ""Wisdom"", some of the explanations are less than sufficient. Author starts talking about ""mind objects"" without ever explaining what they are. This part of the book seems to be more of a summary than anything new. I feel like the author got a little lazy here and just started glossing over things. Or perhaps the level of enlightenment he is trying to describe is too advanced a concept to be covered within one brief section.In summary, I found it interesting possibly because I have some background in neuropsychology. I am somewhat of a newcomer to meditation. It could probably be viewed as a very basic primer in both, but helpful no doubt."
218,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,3,"The sub-title of this book describes it's content and purpose: ""The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love & Wisdom."" Rick Hanson is a neuropsychologist and meditation teacher, and he does a good job explaining in lay-person's terms the neurological anatomy and functioning of the brain behind the effects of meditation.The strength of this book is that it doesn't merely tell you what parts of the brain are involved in various functions like decision making, impulse inhibition, and emotions such as happiness, love, equanimity, fear and anger, he offers practices designed to affect the brain, cultivating wholesome emotions and lessening those that are unwholesome.The weakness of the book is that I'm not sure who will most benefit from this book as written. If you are someone interested in and up-to-date on neuroscience, there's not a lot you'll learn here (unless you know the science but have never been instructed in the meditation techniques) and if you are not interested in the science, you'll find it overly technical and maybe even boring!"
219,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1504839-patricia,5,"I was delighted to find a book that mixes modern science with an age old tradition. The science is extremely clear and readable, and Hanson offers so many practical suggestions, some of which are quite fresh, giving the book added value. The practice of ""taking in the good"" is among my favorites and it alone was worth the price of the book. His guidelines for effective communication, based as they are on compassion AND how our brains work, expanded my understanding of reflective listening and greatly refined the way I want to implement the expressive side of the equation. This chapter was probably the most powerful for me in terms of adjusting a long time understanding. As I read this book, I also listened to the 7 part series called The Compassionate Brain that Hansen offers through Sounds True. The combination of the book and video series was quite effective. I felt my Buddha brain growing inside my skull (and my heart). This book will surely become a frequently consulted reference."

This is the second book in the same number of weeks that was really more about self-help than about science/technology/futurism... which I was expecting from a recommendation made by that site. I guess I can see the tie-in with the bit of neuroscience that this book included... but in all, this was not my sort of thing. That said, this is not a BAD book in general... and quite good if you are interested in applying the latest knowledge gleaned from neuroscience (mixed with Buddhism) towards your own self-improvement/happiness.

I'm glad doctors and scientists are learning more about which parts of the brain do what, but I'm not that interested in those types of anatomical specifics. I would have liked more detailed descriptions of the nature of mind and the different types of meditation. They get into this, but another source might be better if you want to go deep into the subject of meditation itself. There are several good meditation exercises included. I think to do them effectively one would need to first make a recording while reading them aloud and then play them back. Pema Chodron's audio lectures and meditation exercises seem to be a better way to learn and practice and I'd rather listen to her than myself. However, I'll probably keep this on hand as a reference.

A reasonable working hypothesis is the mind is what the brain does."" pg 39One of the best descriptions of the Buddhist path to freedom from suffering that I've ever read- ""If you can break the link between feeling tones and craving- if you can be with the pleasant without chasing after it, with the unpleasant without resisting it, and with the neutral without ignoring it- then you have cut the chain of suffering, at least for a time. And that is an incredible blessing and freedom."" pg 174A precise description of empathy, one that I've not heard before- ""Empathy is a kind of mindfulness meditation focused on someone else's inner world."" pg 207Practical tools to assist yourself in developing closeness with others (if you struggle with such things, like me)- ""Use imagery to encourage yourself to stay in the moment if you are uncomfortable with closeness. See yourself as a tree being blown in the wind of their emotion but you are still there, still grounded when it is over."" pg 212And finally, a description of the self that actually made sense to me- ""The self is a collection of real representations of an unreal being- like a story about a unicorn."" pg 326Dr. Hanson provides lists of exercises and suggested activities in each chapter to increase the positive and decrease the dysfunction of whatever is going on in your mind. The book ends with nutritional supplement suggestions to support healthy brain function and development which I found to be very helpful and written simply so that even non-neuroscientists can understand it.If you enjoyed Buddha's Brain, I'd suggest reading Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by Ricard Matthieu (Matthieu has been described by researchers as the ""happiest man on earth"" and he shares some of his life lessons) and The Wisdom of the Breath: Three Guided Meditations for Calming the Mind and Cultivating Insight by Bodhipaksa (practical exercises for creating and sustaining some of the mind states described in Buddha's Brain)."

That is bad juju waiting to happen, all the time. So I’ve been working on slowing down, being content in the moment, focusing on the strengths and positives, and working (slowly) on starting a daily meditation practice. (I suck at this so hard.)if you know you need to slow down/focus/meditate, are avoidant like me, and need a factual science grounding for the Why, this is a decent place to start. Authors are an MD and a neurologist, with long meditation practice, and they reference modern research that supports their positions. The book starts with anatomy and physiology of the brain, why its parts do what they do, and then moves into how we can consciously support better minds on top of that brain topography by being mindful. It’s not a book that will do much if you speed through it, I suspect— there’s a lot to reflect on, and practice. I didn’t love all of the practice examples, but again: that’s me and my resistance. It’s worth checking out, paired with other helpful tools, like a great therapist. :D"

I find it a very illuminating book with practical suggestions as to practices which might help in the attainment of happiness.In the last section titled ""Wisdom"", some of the explanations are less than sufficient. Author starts talking about ""mind objects"" without ever explaining what they are. This part of the book seems to be more of a summary than anything new. I feel like the author got a little lazy here and just started glossing over things. Or perhaps the level of enlightenment he is trying to describe is too advanced a concept to be covered within one brief section.In summary, I found it interesting possibly because I have some background in neuropsychology.

In other words, we get sad because it is easy to be sad (thanks to the evolutionary traits left by our ancestors). Moreover, after examining the roots of sadness, the book suggests certain practices such as compassion, kindness, and lovingness, which are drawn from the Buddhist philosophical tradition, to be joyful in life. Recommended to those who are willing to learn about how our brains work and how we can reduce suffering and increase happiness in a scientific way based on spiritual frameworks.P.S.

Hence, one of the biggest uses of meditation to help us be calmer. The first chapter of this book was slow, but after that it’s really fascinating.

This book is very technical at times to show you what is happening in the brain, but does a good job explaining it and then moves on to explain what it all means relative to what is going on in your brain or the brain of one who meditates. So far it's a great book, but it does require you to pay attention. Some books you can fade in and out of listening, but I find myself going back over things as I reallly want to learn more and understand perfectly what is being discuessed. great book. "

There are so much better books out there about mindfulness, meditation, psychology and the brain, but I think this one is actually one of the first in this new wave of those (am I wrong?). There’s really nothing bad about this book but even though it’s always pleasant to read about this subject, this one didn’t catch my attention like many other books about the same subjects did.

It gives a scientific and physiological basis for understanding all the changes that have taken place in my life. While demystifying it all, the Buddha never claimed that it was anything but totally human,it just strengthens my resolve with the understanding that it's all real and that the benefits promised are a physiological fact. Put in the footwork and these things will happen."
257,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2975029-eohlson,3,"Like ""The Winner's Brain"" (TWB) this might be more interesting to people that haven't read so many other brain books. (I still like ""Brain Rules"" the best.) Also like TWB, it's a recent book, so lots of new research is referenced. I actually picked this book up for the meditation exercises, since it was mentioned in TWB that meditation increases the thickness of the cortex. (Also mentioned in ""Buddha's Brain"".)So I'm bumping this to a 3 star rating since I think that better reflects how the standard reader would feel about the book."
258,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689274-libby,4,"This interesting book details the neuroscience of how our brains are wired--e.g., we are hardwired to veer toward the negative because the primitive part of our brain was originally on the lookout for danger (essential to our continued survival). However, we don't have to be held hostage to this: we can take active steps to change our brains and be happier. There is also an appendix that lists and describes vitamin supplementation that can enhance our brain's functioning."

I'm a science nerd but also a very spiritual person - so this book was the perfect intersection of these two fields for me. It gave me a good scientific understanding of how spiritual practices are positive from a neuroscience perspective as well. It's not extremely detailed scientifically and uses some vague, evocative language to describe emotions etc that may not appeal to the overly ""rational"" minds. "
260,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5440048-lindsay,2,"This book is written by a scientist who tries to publish a book about self-help. It doesn't work. His vocabulary doesn't fit a typical self-help book, his writing style is kinda dry. While the title says ""Buddha's Brain"", most of the book is not about Buddhism but more about how the brain works and some very simple meditations. Maybe perfect for those who are new to mindfulness but nothing useful for those with more experience. "

To be honest, the terminologies on brain structure are a little bit disturbing to me. Maybe I am not open-minded enough to embrace this new knowledge. Well, the figures there are very clear indeed. The other thing I learn from the book is to love yourself and love others. And hope to practice to be mindful, which is a real challenge to me. lol. "

Many say We are what we eat. I now feel, just as importantly, the way we think shapes our thoughts. Taking a mindful approach gives us the best opportunity to best use our grey matter. Well, that's what I think anyway."

It gives a scientific and physiological basis for understanding all the changes that have taken place in my life. While demystifying it all, the Buddha never claimed that it was anything but totally human,it just strengthens my resolve with the understanding that it's all real and that the benefits promised are a physiological fact. Put in the footwork and these things will happen."
287,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2975029-eohlson,3,"Like ""The Winner's Brain"" (TWB) this might be more interesting to people that haven't read so many other brain books. (I still like ""Brain Rules"" the best.) Also like TWB, it's a recent book, so lots of new research is referenced. I actually picked this book up for the meditation exercises, since it was mentioned in TWB that meditation increases the thickness of the cortex. (Also mentioned in ""Buddha's Brain"".)So I'm bumping this to a 3 star rating since I think that better reflects how the standard reader would feel about the book."
288,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689274-libby,4,"This interesting book details the neuroscience of how our brains are wired--e.g., we are hardwired to veer toward the negative because the primitive part of our brain was originally on the lookout for danger (essential to our continued survival). However, we don't have to be held hostage to this: we can take active steps to change our brains and be happier. There is also an appendix that lists and describes vitamin supplementation that can enhance our brain's functioning."
289,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7176696-aparna,4,"Enjoyed this book a lot! I'm a science nerd but also a very spiritual person - so this book was the perfect intersection of these two fields for me. It gave me a good scientific understanding of how spiritual practices are positive from a neuroscience perspective as well. It's not extremely detailed scientifically and uses some vague, evocative language to describe emotions etc that may not appeal to the overly ""rational"" minds. "
290,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5440048-lindsay,2,"This book is written by a scientist who tries to publish a book about self-help. It doesn't work. His vocabulary doesn't fit a typical self-help book, his writing style is kinda dry. While the title says ""Buddha's Brain"", most of the book is not about Buddhism but more about how the brain works and some very simple meditations. Maybe perfect for those who are new to mindfulness but nothing useful for those with more experience. "
291,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50780835-yuekun-liu,3,"The book may be more attractive to those who have some basic knowledge in neuroscience. To be honest, the terminologies on brain structure are a little bit disturbing to me. Maybe I am not open-minded enough to embrace this new knowledge. Well, the figures there are very clear indeed. The other thing I learn from the book is to love yourself and love others. And hope to practice to be mindful, which is a real challenge to me. lol. "
292,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49794435-sarah-goss,4,"""Buddha's Brain"" is more of a book on neuroscience than a book of Buddhist philosophy. Although it is somewhat repetitive of other neuroscience books, as many popular science-minded books are, the angle from which it is told brings a fresh analysis of purpose-driven suffering, and why a forward-thinking mindset toward acceptance, forgiveness, and living life to the fullest is a healthy approach to mental wellness."
293,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4779457-frank-baird,3,"Excellent book. Easy read. Brings together the reported effects of mindfulness practice with the science of the brain. Sometimes that matters to people, sometimes not. I think of science as a story and this is a compelling story with metaphors about practice reshaping the brain or optimizing neural wiring."
294,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15328807-leslie,5,"Well worth reading as a guide to finding your own internal happiness, love and wisdom. A good guidebook for a healthy life, presented with a smooth synthesis of mindfulness and neuroscience. Fairly dense in parts so takes some time to get through. I appreciated suggestions of practices going along with topics for each chapter, so the ideas can be very practically applied in your life."
295,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12644819-amy,5,"This was a well researched and thought out book. A great combination of how the brain works and how you can use the philosophies of Buddhism in your life for general peace, happiness and overall well being. He discusses things on a very basic easy to read level. He writes personal stories and his thoughts to keep it interesting. A well written and interesting read."
296,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1541562-diane,4,"I'll have to read this again - I feel like I took away many good things, but that there are more levels here than I grok at this time. Which is fine. Lots of good insight into why our minds work the way they do and how to work with our minds to make them more calm. Interesting stuff with an exhaustive appendix of references to scientific studies."
297,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12648231-ryan-brinkworth,3,"I enjoyed hearing about the workings of the brain, how it is shaped by events, and consequently shapes us. Many say We are what we eat. I now feel, just as importantly, the way we think shapes our thoughts. Taking a mindful approach gives us the best opportunity to best use our grey matter. Well, that's what I think anyway."
298,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52197150-stephanie-gonzalez,4,"The main thing I enjoyed about this book is that the author gives a lot of simple, practical tips you can put to use immediately. There are also tips on how to build a meditation practice and improve your mind over time, but I found some of the simpler ideas that I could employ immediately especially helpful. "
299,1572246952,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64514188-tanya-salgado,5,I was drawn to this book immediately and I am so glad. Very easy to read yet written by two doctors. It explains what goes on in your brain chemically and physically when experiencing different emotions and feelings. Gives you an amazing insight! A tool to understanding the mind that everyone should read!
