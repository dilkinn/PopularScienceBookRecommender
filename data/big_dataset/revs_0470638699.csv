0,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"OK, this is annoying. It's the second science book in a row that lacks proper definition. What type of annoyance is that? (Hint: It's number 2. Pun not intended, but I'll keep it.)l) Physical unpleasantness: such as onions making us cry or poison ivy making us itch, are a very old (at least Cambrian) physical part of our evolution. ""This minor hurt can become major if you keep doing it so quit!"" 2) Plans thwarted: or ruined expectations. We expect/need to get to work in 30 minutes, but road construction springs up unexpectedly & it takes way longer.3) Conflicts with our value/social system: is also expectation based, but more with people such as public nose picking. These vary a lot between people & cultures, many are learned. There are a lot of annoyances which are different from things that anger us - maybe - depends on who you ask & that's the part that irritates me. Science should be precise, but nothing about this was. It's not the authors' fault, but it points to a huge hole in our knowledge, even (I suspect) in our language. Scientists say annoyance may be a low level emotion of its own, similar to frustration, or it may be a lower level of the emotion ""anger"" along with frustration. Rage would be a high level of anger. I can live with that, but I'm surprised that we're still using the same term for both physical & mental reactions, especially after the last couple of chapters since the process is reversed.Think about it: The grinding of arthritic joints makes a person cranky. Understandable. The pain is causing a bad mental state. BUT in the case of thwarted expectations, whether personal or societal, our annoyance is completely mental. The same smell when labeled differently (cheese or vomit) evokes different reactions. How can such different processes be studied as one emotion? I don't think they are.Music is really variable & a lot depends on whether the person is conservative or innovative in their preference in this area. (Perfect pitch isn't always a blessing since everything is often listened to as musical notes. Seems to be a combination of genetic predisposition along with proper training at the proper time to develop.)Smell is another physical annoyance. Paul Krebaum, a scientist who works with skunk scent has a method of dealing with skunk smell since his lab works with strong smells including skunks. They use a really strong hydrogen peroxide (30%?) to scrub hydrogen sulfide from waste gas streams in the laboratory. A friend's cat had run in with a skunk & the standards (tomato juice) didn't work well enough. Because skunk spray is composed mainly of thiols like Krebaum was working with, he suggested bathing the cat in a lightweight version of the lab's solution. Worked like a charm.- 1 qt. 3% hydrogen peroxide (from drugstore)- 1/4 cup baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)- 1 teaspoon liquid soap- Rinse with waterWe plan to try this & I'm sure we'll have an opportunity soon since we seem to have at least one dog sprayed a couple of times a year, often more. Marg bought more hydrogen peroxide today. Typically we wash them with dish soap, rinse, rub in baking soda & pour on vinegar. The acid & foaming action strip out most of the smell. Rinse again & wash again with dish soap. Baby shampoo for the face. Cuts down on 95% of the smell, but the dog will still stink when they get wet until they've fully shed. Even 5% isn't pleasant & wet, old-skunked dog... Yuck.Here's the table of contents. I'm sorry that I didn't comment on each chapter this time.A Note from the Authors. Introduction: Cell Phones. 1 A Noise Annoys. 2 A Case of Mistaken Intensity. 3 Fingernails on a Chalkboard. 4 Skunked. 5 Bugged by Bugs An Epic Bugging 6 Who Moved Their Cheese? 7 The Terror of Perfect Pitch. 8 Dissonant. 9 Breaking the Rules. 10 He's Just Not That Annoyed by You. 11 Better Late Than Never Doesn't Apply Here. 12 When Your Mind Becomes a Foreign Country (Huntington's Disease)13 The Annoyed Brain. 14 False Alarms. Conclusion.All in all, it was interesting, but too broad & scattered. Again, not the authors' fault, but the scientists. This is a young, soft, complicated science. I recommend it."
1,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143572-william-thomas,2,"This book is annoying. The premise is intriguing and super-modern or 'in the now', much as texts on the rise of anxiety in the leisure classes was in the early 1900's. However, there is no clear thesis and no solid science or psychology that pinpoints what exactly makes us as humans annoyed. There is a long list of things that are annoying and the sciences behind some of those things- such as the buzzing of a fly or perfect pitch or the smell of a skunk's secretion. But that doesn't exactly explain anything really. Because with every case they study, they have exceptions and counter-cases. Which makes it hard to formulate any one thesis or form any sort of cohesive argument that there is any science or psychology that plays only into annoyance. The book instead, without meaning to, makes annoyance a part of other emotions and other states of being such as anger. they try their hardest to distance themselves from moving into these other realms by side-stepping them, but without knowing it, the authors are making cases more for anger than annoyance. Without a clear thesis, the book is just a compilation of random psychological studies and scientific research of fairly quirky and underground topics. For that the book is fabulous. It's like listening to a podcast on NPR. Hearing all of these findings and coming away with new factoids to discuss over dinner. But as anything academic the book brings nothing to the table. In the end, there appears to be no true evaluation or universal idea of what is annoying or why certain things annoy certain people. It then becomes more a matter of experience, taste and sensitivity rather than a strict scientific study. It is altogether subjective and not a coherent or rational study of science or psychology for itself, but instead, a branch of other sciences and psychologies. Grade: C-"
2,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"If you don't like science, don't read this book, if you are looking for anecdotal stories to confirm your own feelings, this book isn't for you. If you prefer psychology books who tell a good story but lack data, this book is not for you. If you prefer writers who rely on anecdotal stories, who lack any evidence for their claims, such as Deepak Chopra, Eckhart Tolle, and David Avocado Wolf to more fact-based scientific writers such as Steven Hawking, Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, or Sean Carroll, then this book isn't for you. Not that this book has anything to do with the above authors other than the fact that, like the authors of this book, all of them are able to engage in critical thinking. If you are not about critical thinking, do not start this book. Hopefully that will keep you from giving a good book a poor rating, not because of the quality of the book, but rather because of your own inability to appreciate fact over fiction and entertainment. This book was EXCELLENT, PSYCHOLOGY DONE RIGHT. If I were not considering other factors, I probably would have given it 4 stars. But I read far too many 1 and 2 stars reviews. I feel certain that many (most ?) of these reviewers would have given 5 stars to the medical medium quack who just put out a best seller, which contains a ridiculous amount of pseudoscience. This book was well written, well researched, stuck to only the facts produced by good methodology, entertaining, and extremely informative. If you are often frustrated by psych books that cite studies but never seem aware of bad methods, don't cross this book off your list. They did an excellent job of explaining the science of being annoyed. There were a couple times where the methods were a bit in question, but very rarely. Solid piece of work! I would not normally do this, but I would suggest my fellow critical thinkers bump this up a star in an effort to counteract the negative reviews by the people who picked up this book hoping for a fluff piece and were disappointed when they actually had to learn science. "
3,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882431-joy,4,"I saw this book on the library shelf and read it in an attempt to get some secular insight on what I feared was becoming a spiritual problem. I dreaded becoming a grouchy, old woman because routine things and people are getting annoying. I can hardly 'fix' the old or woman, but I do want to be kind and patient. The book was very helpful. There are three types of annoyances: (l) physical unpleasantness, (2) plans thwarted (sleep loss from a barking dog), (3) conflicts with our value system (uncouth habits, inconsiderate acts, norm violations). My insight was to consider an annoyance as I would pain, as a warning signal that something is wrong and it allows one to do something before there is more damage. So: my plan has become to identify the annoyance and why I am annoyed. Then, see if I can change the situation, avoid the situation, or just endure. I have found this approach very helpful, and I'm feeling that annoyances are something I can deal with rather than something out of my control. Perhaps I should rate this a ""5"" now."
4,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2771351-kimberly,2,"If you ask me what I find most annoying, 90% of my responses would begin with ""people who."" People who don't control their children, people who block aisles in the grocery store or stand at the bottom of the escalator, people who think the rules don't apply to them, etc.This book is 250 pages long, and it discusses the annoyances of smell, insects, and sounds (lots and lots of sounds), but never really arrives at annoying people. It is frequently mentioned that annoyances differ from culture to culture (more on this later), with one of the top annoyances worldwide being cell phone conversations. However, the authors suggest that we find the conversations annoying because we can only hear half of the conversation, and therefore we are trying to fill in the missing pieces to get the full dialogue. I wholeheartedly disagree. I find a cellphone conversation annoying because the person having it is completely inconsiderate of the people around him/her. Do you think the checkout clerk at the grocery store finds a customer's cellphone conversation annoying because he can only hear half of it? No--it's annoying because it's completely rude and suggests that the clerk is not worth your full attention. The FAA once talked about lifting the ban on cellphones on airplanes, and the passengers overwhelming said not to do it. Why? Because no one wants to be on a plane for three hours listening to the cacophony of other people having loud conversations, whether personal or business.And why do we get annoyed by the inconsideration of others? Because it inconveniences us and because we expect certain manners and social graces, and the mixture of these two things sours our feelings.The book talks a lot about different studies on annoyances, such as diseases that give people a shorter fuse, or whether or not animals can be annoyed and if they are annoyed by the same things that humans are. I found the most interesting part to be a very short discussion about how different cultures find different things annoying. It talked about how Americans are very me-centric, where we are raised to look out for ourselves and praise independence, while Japanese are told to always look out for the good of the group and never put one's needs above others. Therefore, what is commonplace in America would be perceived as extremely rude and annoying in Japan. Same for a short mention of how time is perceived in different countries and if they are sticklers for being on time.Even the cover graphic is never addressed. Why do people find Christmas lights annoying? It's not because of a smell or a sound, but because no matter how carefully you put them away, they always emerge in a tangled mess the next year, and it takes forever to undo them. It's not fun, and it can ruin the whole experience of decorating for the holidays.Anyway, while the book was mildly interesting, it wasn't nearly what I expected and I feel like it really missed the mark. I certainly didn't need a whole chapter to explain to me why skunk smells are annoying (or why they aren't). Maybe next time they could try explaining more of the ""people who"" aspect."
5,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,0,"Personally, I think there’s an epidemic of annoyances around.The authors of this book, Joe Palca and Flora Lichtman (both of NPR’s Science Friday) tells us in their teaser video (on their website at annoyingbook.com) that there seems to be an equation:annoying = unpleasant + unpredictable + temporarywhich seem to be the key ingredients.I’m pretty certain from my own experiences that they’re missing something there, and I suspect it’s because there are multiple types of annoyances. What isn’t in their equation is the problem of disappointed expectations.Sure, the scraping of fingernails down down a chalkboard is irritating, but it usually misses that other aspect. What their equation doesn’t explain very well is the annoyance of the sidewalk — you’re moving along efficiently down a city sidewalk and suddenly you come across a group of people two or three abreast, causally strolling at an a snail’s pace and oblivious to the fact that they are blocking the path. Or that person who unlocks their bicycle from a post and leans it against their body so it blocks that same sidewalk until they finish their little chore. Or the motorcyclist who doesn’t care how staggeringly and obnoxiously loud their exhaust note is on a city street, or the driver that leans on a horn in a parking garage, again oblivious to how it affects anyone other than themselves.The annoyances 

I

 feel more often are based in people’s all-to-frequent insensitivity to the effect of their actions on others when 

I

 think they should know better.Did Palca and Lichtman capture that side of annoying, or only the superficial stuff?We’ll see.(Oh, yeah, check out the NY Times review:

6,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/894446-keely,4,"This book was supremely interesting! If you like psychology or NPR or are easily annoyed (like me) then you'll find ""Annoying"" fascinating. I expected this book to be about the many situations and people we find annoying, but it was largely sensory oriented. In order for the book to work, the definition of ""annoying"" was broadened to ""irritating"" or ""unpleasant""--especially when it came to our senses of taste, smell and hearing. This was necessary in order to explain the research: largely because the book attempts to span across cultures and also includes animal research in order to find experiences that are universally annoying. The authors really delve deep into the science behind unpleasant experiences. They explain why some experiences become less unpleasant over time and can become something we prefer (like eating hot peppers). While other experiences start out cute and become more annoying as time waxes on (like your partner's quirks). The authors leave no stone unturned and I guarantee you'll see your surroundings (and that cell phone talker on the bus) through a new lens."
7,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,4,"*Annoyance is a fact of life. (Now, that's annoying!)*Appropriately enough, while trying to finish the very last pages of _Annoying_ while at a cafe this morning, I found myself becoming increasingly annoyed at the loud, non-stop conversation coming from the gabbers at the table next to mine. But, thanks to what I had just read in this book, I knew exactly why my annoyance level was growing!First off, the event was unpredictable and unexpected. (Normally on Saturday mornings, this cafe is pretty quiet and the conversations from other tables are not such an effort to tune out as was the case with this conversation today.) Second, the conversation was distracting me from my goal of finishing this book. (Couldn't they just keep quiet for five minutes as I read the last few pages?!?) Adding to the annoyance factors were the unpleasant droning qualities of the of the chatters' voices and the uncertainty of when the conversation would end. (If I would have known the droners were going to be leaving soon, it'd would have been much easier to tolerate this temporary annoyance.)Luckily, I was able to drown out the conversation enough to read the hints in the book's conclusion on overcoming annoyances. I could convince myself that finishing the book wasn't that important and in the grand scheme of things, this temporary distraction wasn't such a big deal. I could try harder to block out the voices and focus intently on the words on these last few pages. Alternatively, I could head-butt the annoyers (as was the approach used by an annoyed soccer player whose story was featured in the book), or at least imagine doing so to help ease my irritation level. Or, I could simply accept the annoyance, and realize that the irritating conversations of others are an inherent feature of cafes.I pondered these tips for a bit as I looked up from the book and continued my efforts to block out the still-unending conversation. Then, I read the authors' conclusion:""You could try all of those things, but based on our extensive research, none of these strategies works that well.""Oh great.Fortunately, the authors were able to provide some relief in the final paragraph of the book:""So, as a last ditch effort, remember that bad feelings--on the whole--usually aren't so bad. They signal that something is wrong, which throws into relief the things that usually aren't.""And, suddenly, I was no longer annoyed. Or annoyed that I was annoyed. (And, I also realized that the chatters had left the cafe too...but that's besides the point.)"
8,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1524599-hamideh-mohammadi,3,"I read the introduction and thought ""Ok, let's find out about the science behind getting annoyed!"". There were maybe two or three chapters that made somewhat clear arguments, but the rest was just basically claiming that ""You get annoyed by X, because it is annoying to human beings."" or ""Y is annoying because you didn't expect it to fall into your lap."" or here's the most interesting one ""Some movie characters are annoying but you laugh at them because you aren't them."" It goes without saying that when the previous research on your topic of interest is scant, you really don't have much scientific explanation to build up your argument on. Or maybe I was a wrong audience for this book, I expected more neuroscience than psychology and sociology or even animal science. "
9,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3159607-sara,3,"This was funnier than I expected! It's a scientific look at what annoys people. Last night, I watched the video of Ellen taking Michelle Obama shopping at CVS and Ellen behaves like a total jerk, and I was able to think, ""Hey, that book was just talking about how we all enjoy watching annoying people on TV, as long as they are lovable enough."" "
10,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24206425-b-a-wilson,3,"Okay. I could be snarky and talk about everything about this book that is a bit annoying, but the reality is that this a strange and interesting start into researching what annoyance is, how it is defined, and what qualities or factors help make something annoying. Unfortunately, there is not even proof that annoyance actually exists as a true emotion, and that it isn’t just a mislabeled gradient or combination of other emotions, such as a low level of anger or frustration. On a language scale, we all agree annoying exists, and we know exactly which things annoy us, even if don’t all define annoying in the same way. On a science scale, defining annoyance is an entirely different matter. This book goes off on some long tangents in random directions, and it tries to justify why certain things are so annoying in terms of senses (sounds, smells, tastes, etc). I would have liked more information on the human/behavioral aspects of annoyance than what I got, but this isn’t a bad overall perspective on annoyance. I found some of the side research that is referenced quite interesting, particularly the commentary on those with perfect pitch, even though it wasn’t the kind of information I expected to receive from this book. The book does try to count/label the different things that tend to annoy people, but the reality is that what is annoying is different to everyone. Sure, there are underlying factors such as pitch/tone, repetition, past experiences, uncertainty, culture, bodily functions, etc, but there’s no way to quantify how much of something it actually takes to annoy a certain person in any moment. Basically, there are so many variables when it comes to annoyance, so there’s no quick answer. If you were hoping to read this book to figure out what makes people in your everyday life so annoying, just forget it. You’re more likely to figure out what makes you so irritated by others, rather than what makes them so annoying. So what it boils down to is that the human factor controls annoyance. Even when researched, what is attractive to a person in one moment could become annoying to them in the next. The thought I liked the best is that extreme traits, which are often a strength, can become annoying, because of how often that trait is exposed. For example, someone who is kind and agreeable can later be seen as a doormat, and someone who is strong and outspoken can often, after many times of speaking out, be seen as stubborn or domineering. While these initial traits are admirable, they can start to appear the opposite, the more times someone experiences those. The problem is, those are still good traits in people, but the constant repetition of them becomes tiresome or frustrating to people. In reality, if we appreciate these traits in people, then we should not be annoyed when they display these traits. However, we are human, and our annoyance is not always logical. We are predisposed to be annoyed by the repetition, so sometimes we are annoyed, whether it is fair or not. One example of this would be when a person says they love how funny their partner is and that he/she is so laid back and doesn’t overreact to anything, but then later they decide that they hate how their partner is immature, makes childish jokes, and doesn’t take anything seriously. In a small dose, these traits were admirable. The repetition is what makes an admirable trait become annoying with time. So basically you are guaranteed to annoy the person you are in a relationship with, and if it’s a fatal attraction, you’re going to annoy them with the very thing you used to attract them in the first place. Good luck, people. It’s a cold, hard world, and unfortunately, this book did not find that annoyance will keep you warm at night. Book 45 read in 2018Pages: 272PS: If you were not annoyed by my review, then I probably didn’t make it long enough and should have repeated myself a few more times, while humming a dissonant tone, and burning an acidic stick of incense, while standing too close to you. ;)"
11,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34625104-fowl4396,4,"Annoying: The Science of What Bugs Us by Joe Palca was an enjoyable book that I personally really liked. It is a nonfiction book that adds a little humor in neurology. The book is about scientists quest to find out how to scale what truly bugs us through testing their hypothesis.Throughout the book there are tests performed that I was satisfied with because of their accuracy and variation, so that not all the tests were the same. Many of the tests include how people react to tastes and noises. This was funny for me because I wonder why people would volunteer for something that annoys them.I also found results to be pleasing simply because that they seemed to be true to the test. Even though there is not really a scale for how annoying something really is. The results really give a good insight of the scientist's purpose for the test.There was only one thing that I found enjoyable, which was the somewhat high use of large complicated vocabulary. I enjoy trying to learn to new larger vocabulary, but some of the words that the author used in this was just a little over whelming to understand. Overall, I rate this book a 4 stars and a recommend you read this book if you want to know how to annoy people using simple things."

They delve into experiments and anatomy of annoyances--smells, sounds, mental chemistry, etc. They also give ideas on what causes annoyance and anger and what sort of behavior and avoidance we can employ. In example, they decry public cell phone calls, walk us through considering zoning out of our peripheral attention and focusing on ourselves or behaving in a civil manner.

Very difficult to now allow ourselves to get annoyed, admittedly, but I do believe we have that choice."

Had no idea this was even a research area and I was amazed to discover all the different ways to get annoyed :). Also I was quite surprised to find so much of what we find annoying is because of our culture. Did you know there are cultures in which it is so extremely not done to show any annoyance with whatever, that if you do show any, you'll get the silent treatment for months(!)? The most annoying thing however was when the book goes on about what is probably the most annoying music (by western standards), which is made by the Mafa people of Cameroon, and I can't find an example! Oh and talking loudly on a cellphone is always annoying, because the brain apparantly hates it when it can only hear one side of the conversation. It tries to fill in the gaps which keeps it occupied and that will distract you (although not everyone to the same degree of course). The hypotheses (or maybe already theory, I forgot) is that this is because it wants to predict what will happen next. Will there be any danger? If it only hears one side it's very hard to do so ergo distraction. If you like these kinds of facts you'll enjoy this book thoroughly. (And yes there is also a hilarious tip on how annoy one or more people at the same time, and it only costs 15 dollars!)"

It is a book that is written methodically, fairly based on facts, draws its strength mostly from science (some from pseudo-science). It is entertaining at times and serious at others. If that’s your thing; pick up this book !!!This is not a fluff piece. It is not written to validate the inner psychologist in you. It is not written to prove your theories on the annoyingness of the world and people around you. If these are the factors that you are looking for “Put the Damn Book Down !”You will read things in this book that you will realize that you always knew but could never phrase or even think out.

They took two NPR personalities who obviously have had no coaching in reading an audiobook and then had them take turns at no clear intervals. The woman's voice was particularly annoying to me. These two also pronounced words wrong, such as ""chimpanzee"" and ""capsicum"". Considering they're professionally people who talk to the public for a living, this lapse seems either intentional or stupid. In addition, the author's concluding statements, that annoyances are basically trivial and you should get over them, is particularly annoying and not in keeping with the rest of the book. Another psychological jab or a cheap cliché? I'm not sure which.Despite this, the book offered some very interesting perspectives and insights on the science of annoyance."

Who doesn't say at least once a day, ""That is so annoying"" or ""He/She is so annoying"" or some variation on that indicating your annoyance? While reading this book I did notice how many times a day I may mumble about my annoyance with someone or something. :) So a book about the science of annoyance is fascinating to me! Palca and Lichtman truly do discuss the science behind what may be annoyances. In that regard it was a little over my head at times. I can handle science speak in layman's terms but when it starts getting too technical I start to glaze over. So I really had to focus and slow way down on those parts. But I managed to grasp the overall conclusions of the book. Annoyance is a mystery within the emotional psychology world. Some say it is on the anger spectrum, others say it belongs in a class almost by itself, and yet others aren't really sure where to place annoyance. Frankly, it's a little annoying to not know where to put it! Ha. And yes, that kind of irony is throughout the book. The authors, leaning heavily on various research done in and around this mystery response, conclude that annoyance in social ways, in olfactory sense, in breaking of rules, in missed expectations, in interruptions of obtaining a goal, in auditory sense, in some brain injuries are all legit reasons for annoyance to occur. The research in each field can point to reasons why annoyance may be felt or happen. Because it is such a vague response there is still a lot of cloud cover as to how annoyance progresses in someone but there are scientific studies that are helping to point the way to progression. This was such an interesting read and look into the response of annoyance. It's really making me think through the times when I utter that I am annoyed. The basic conclusion of the book though is that everyone feels annoyed at times, perhaps even daily, and it is our chosen response to the annoyance as to how deeply we let it impact our days. This is a ""fun"" and informative read on such an interesting topic. I'm not annoyed at all that I read it, I'm rather glad! "
40,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4694420-orbs-n-rings,5,"Engaging, interesting a true treat for the ear, the mind and the senses. I found ANNOYING the Audiobook very interesting and at times very amusing. The voices of the authors Palca and Lichtman are pleasant and easy to listen to and I like how they take turns throughout the chapters of the audiobook by alternately speaking, which makes the audiobook less annoying. Other than Palca maybe being a little close to the microphone which I could tell by the sound of his slight breathing the book recording was clear, consistent and kept my interest throughout all five Cd's. This is an audio book I can listen to over and over again and not get tired of it. In Palca and Lichtman's quest to find out the true science behind what irritates people ANNOYING is a combination of scientific studies, thought provoking ideas and conclusions that will leave you stirred and pleasantly surprised. The chapter of the book about chili peppers brought on a heated conversation between my husband and I. My husband loves to eat hot peppers raw and he doesn't considered it to be annoying in the least bit. So he tried to contradict this part of the study when I had him listen to it. I could see his point, however I on the other hand think the opposite and do find chili peppers annoying and wonder why he consumes them like this. I tend to think sometimes in black and white, so I found myself thinking that maybe it is just a matter of sensitivity. I am a very sensitive person in many ways and my husband is the opposite. Noise can send me through the roof, it is a painful stimuli for my senses and it just seems to vibrate through me. Something I have tried to explain many times to others while feeling like an alien because I know they never understand. If you would like some insight into the how and why people react or behave a certain way to particular noises. Whether it be cell phone chatter from a stranger next to you or a buzzing fly invading your ear space this audio book is for you."

(For anyone out there who isn't a psychology nerd, operationalize means the act of taking an abstract concept and defining it so that you can measure it in experiments.)All of the research in this book is accompanied by citations as well as interviews with experts in various disciplines who study concepts related to annoyance (emotion in general, and anger).Readers without a background in psychology and biology might find some of the material in this book a bit difficult to enjoy on a purely casual level. It isn't as accessible as Randy Frost's book, Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things or even Cordelia Fine's A Mind of its Own: How Your Brain Distorts and Deceives.Also, the audiobook is read by the authors who are probably better researchers than readers; they're not terrible, but this wasn't the most professional recording I've ever heard."

As someone who finds a tremendous number of things annoying, I definitely wanted to read this book. I finished it in a couple of days but am not sure whether it actually met my expectations. It began well, with a discussion on why cell phone conversations are particularly annoying, then a generalized recipe for annoyance (temporary, unpleasant, unpredictable things). The second half of the book was also good, basically what I was after, with stories about why people find their spouses' habits so irritating and what happens to annoyance levels when various parts of the brain are injured. Where the book was weakest was when it talked about animals being ""annoyed"" in lab tests. Since it's hard to determine whether animals actually experience annoyance the same way we do (and we can't exactly ask them to describe their thoughts), the results didn't seem to have much of an impact. Part of the problem with the idea of studying ""the science of what bugs us"" is the fact that it's such a new discipline, as is stated repeatedly throughout the book. There isn't as much scientific literature to draw upon and so the book can feel a bit repetitive or padded in places (the part about skunk spray, for example). Still, it doesn't take long to read, so read it if you're interested."

My big gripe about this book is that it was too short and because the topic of annoyance is so seldom addressed, I developed a veracious appetite for the content. Funny at times and highly enjoyable.Facts I gleemed* Actions or behaviours we cannot ignore we find rude* Unpredictably adds creates and/or increases annoyance* McDonald's milkshake has almost as much salt as their fries* The Annoyatron from ThinkGeek is a must buy to annoy people* The ear canal has a natural resonance that boosts sound pitches of around 3000hz which is the same frequency of a person/child's scream* Annoying is also something that stops you from doing what you want to do* To ignore something annoying, focus on something else completely different* Social Allergens is the term coined for small things that in infrequent and low doses isn't annoying but tolerance decreases as time progresses. Broken down in to 1) Uncouth habits 2) Inconsiderate acts 3) Intrusive behaviours4) Norm violation* Many depressed people are irritable and tendency to assume the worse even when there is no evidence * Annoyance is considered low level anger with rage being on the other end"
44,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2379625-andrew,4,"Joe Palca and Flora Lichtman did well to tie so many disparate branches of study together to explore the nature of what annoys people. The book describes branches of psychology, biology, chemistry and physics (acoustics) and the researchers and experiments designed to elicit understanding of why it is that certain things irritate us and why we can't just ignore them. What I most liked about the book was that it wasn't a simple factual regurgitation of the scientific literature. The authors take you into the labs of the researchers and explain how the research was done, what the scientists concluded and what questions are left to be answered.It was not a perfect book: there were some oversimplifications of acoustic phenomenon and I would suspect other experts in other sciences would have similar critiques about the chemistry or neurology sections. However, for non-experts reading these sections the introductions were good enough to get a reader a basic understanding and not wrong enough to lead them astray. A fun, quick, and informative read highlighting the scientific process, Annoying is great for scientist or science-curious alike."
45,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1736304-lisa,2,"This barely makes a two-stars rating for me. I found this book to be annoying ... it just didn't meet my expectations. It's a relatively quick read, but after trying to give it a go for about eighty pages, I ended up skimming the rest. It just wasn't that interesting. The science itself is rather paltry; one study (in Chapter 13: The Annoyed Brain) is described at length and you're thinking, ""Oh, this might be a reasonable explanation"" until you read "" ... but this was a small study--only twenty people--so sweeping conclusions are premature."" ?! I did find Chapter 12 to be somewhat interesting (chapter title: When Your Mind Becomes a Foreign Land), as this chapter discusses Huntington's Disease, which is something I was not familiar with prior to this book (irritability is apparently a common symptom in patients -- not your everyday irritability, but anything-can-set-it-off variety [""a short fuse that ends in a giant explosion""]). So, at least I learned something new. Other than that, I feel the book wasn't really worth my time. "

It's such a recherche topic, but the authors do pull from more popular psychology and sociology to make their points. In that sense, I appreciated how the authors took familiar concepts and applied them to annoyance.I listened to the audio version and have to admit there was a section of the book that annoyed the hell out of me. The authors did their own reading, and I wish they had made sure they knew how to pronounce all the words that they used in the book. The biggest annoyance and most obvious was when they discussed Capuchin monkeys. The authors pronounced it Kah-poo-chin when it's actually pronounced Cap-yoo-chin. Hearing this mistake repeatedly was like the proverbial nails on the chalk board discussed in the book; extremely irritating.Other than this, I thought the authors were engaged which certainly made the book a worthwhile listen. If you're into psychology, I think you'd likely enjoy this enough to make it worth it. "

I really wanted to understand the science of what bugs me, and so often.The book is clear and precise as to what it wants to convey. Unfortunately, the authors disclaimed early on that since the scientific studies behind annoyance is new, this may not be the definitive book. It kind of put me off, but I continued to read it anyway. And I am glad I did.While this book may not be a definitive textbook on the subject matter, it still does shed light on many interesting ideas, theories and hypothesis about being annoyed. Taking from a huge list of experiments done by peers, this book draws on many points, most of which were very interesting to read and learn.Though it does not make it to my favorites' list, it is still recommended for a good read."

Still, there were some interesting bits:* stress and empathy may be related. The more likely you are to be stressed, and through that - annoyed, the less likely you are to be empathetic. This may also be genetically based, tied to autism, and somewhat positively impacted by increasing oxytocin. High stress; low empathy may be related to a faulty oxycontin receptor.* the trait people often report as having attracted them to their parter is often one that later annoyed them e.g. I was attracted to my husband because of his work ethic. I'm annoyed my husband works all of the time. Sensitization may play a role...repeated exposure, you can't escape."

(Looking at you, mom.)Okay, but honestly.This book was fun! A quick, easy, fluffy, and fun little book. It covered a range of different studies into annoyance, from psych lab studies here in the US to how annoyance is shown in a variety of other cultures. It also hypothesized on what type of thing annoys us (the unpredictable when we expect predictability), and talked about which parts of our brain cause annoyance. The best fact I take away from this book is that, while the hippocampus is responsible for standard memory, the amygdala handles emotional memory - so a person can have complete anterograde amnesia and still find themselves incredibly annoyed at continuing stimuli!Fun little book.Thanks mom.

You'll learn just why the most universally annoying thing is listening to the ""halfalogue"" of a cell phone conversation; why the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard makes everyone cringe and how childhood experience can impact why you find a smell annoying or not. The authors also go abroad to talk about how what annoys people in one culture creates no annoyance in another. (Example: Americans have a keen sense of time; how it should be used; when it has been wasted, etc. This is bewildering to people who fully expect that a trip to conduct business should take hours and involve much socializing.) On a more sobering note, the authors also look at annoyance and how and possibly why it is so much a part of the personalities of those who suffer from ailments like Alzheimer's. "

For instance, they raise several times and then don't resolve the issue of whether annoyance is just mild anger or a truly distinct phenomenon. also not clear that what's annoying about fingernails on a chalkboard is meaningfully similar to what's annoying about being cut off in traffic, or smelling a skunk, or......"

However, despite my pet peeves about nasal-sounding voices, this book was overall a hit-and-miss. The authors make it very clear that a scientific study of annoyances is still in its infancy and that they therefore have to rely on quite separate instances of annoyances. What ends up happening is that some chapters, like the ones on sound, are rather interesting while some others, like the one on movies, were absolutely boring. So while some of the scientific principles behind different annoyances were interesting and well understood, other were vaguer leaving the reader, or listener, with an unfulfilled desire to understand why, in general, things are annoying."

Sound quality was a few small steps above your public domain Librivox recordings. It was bearable after getting through about half of the discs. 2. I loved the concept of this book. I picked it up on a whim and started listening shortly thereafter. It seemed a bit shallow at best, which indicates that either a) we still don't fully understand why we get annoyed at things or b) the study was poorly done. It has some interesting points in the beginning as the authors set up  why things > annoy us, but every subsequent test they reference in the rest of the chapters only reiterates those same beginning points. Interesting, however I personally would have gotten the same amount of information out of a two page article in a scientific magazine than out of this entire book. "

The book jumps around with no real direction or order, and upon finishing, I wondered what I had actually learned. In all fairness, Palca and Lichtman warned me in the Intro that there really was no established science or formal studies around the feeling of annoyance. As a result, the book describes a hodgepodge of weird experiments (those poor mice and monkeys) that are meant to show some of the various theories surrounding why we get annoyed at so many different things (from the smell of skunk spray to babies crying on an airplane). The result is a disjointed book that doesn’t leave you with anything except reminders of everything that annoys you."

Surprisingly, there are several different scientists studying annoyance - what causes it and in whom, what happens to the brain when we are annoyed, and whether annoyance of whatever kind has any evolutionary benefit. This book relates several fascinating discoveries and theories, but unfortunately doesn't offer many solutions to dealing with the annoyances in our lives."
56,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1525813-madison,3,"I have to wonder if the authors meant to make the book itself annoying... the authors skipped around from one topic to another without any discernible rhyme or reason and on the audiobook, the authors took turns reading and they seemed to hop back and forth at random times. Each time they switched, I had to get use to the reader's style again. Part of their definition of what is annoying is when we don't expect something to happen and we don't know when it is going to stop. Switching readers at random times is a pretty good example of that. However, I did find some of the studies and information interesting, especially how to avoid be annoyed - expect the unexpected, leave extra time and try to empathize with people (people who are easily annoyed often have low levels of empathy).

How awful that would be. I wish you the best of luck if you are.I guess I learned that it is not necessary for me to be a more tolerant person but rather, I need to walk away, turn off or ignore what is annoying me.

In other words, this book desperately cried out for a sterner editor.My family listened to this on a recent trip - and it pretty much did the job except for one fact: one of the readers was annoying. Palca is a radio personality,and his voice was like having NPR on, just fine. But the other reader, while she may be a fine author, demonstrates why publishers don't usually hire authors to read their books.

A better book overall, though, in that it actually made its point. Nothing earth-shattering--things are annoying when they're unpleasant, we can't control them and we don't know when they'll stop--but interesting.Some of the ideas seem to dovetail well with the emotion research I was reading when I was working with Ekman, and I confess I was rather surprised not to see him cited.

So far the author does an excellent job of applying scientific research in a number of fields to the topic of annoyance, what constitutes annoyance, and those studies are revelatory as well as his sample husband-wife dialogues are amusing and right on. So far he seems to do a great job of interpreting science to raise interesting questions we face in everyday life as annoyed/annoying people alike.:)For example, info on how we hear and why certain sounds are annoying is so interesting!

Can't say I disagree. Palca and Lichtman do a good job of using current brain research to explain why ""half-alogues"" are so annoying: our brains need to try to fill in the unheard half of the conversation, to the point of taking over whatever it is we happen to be trying to do at the time! The other sensory inputs around us (smells, tones, certain sights) seem to be explained by survival instincts all the way back to the reptilian brains.

I have not knowingly heard Mr. Joe Palca on NPR but from the writers' pedigrees, I had expected a more sophisticated writing style and information inclusion. While the cover offered an interesting expected annoyance inducing situation, that particular situation was never even addressed inside.

What it does do is provide a survey of patterns and information that can hopefully one day contribute to the study of annoyance as the field grows. For some chapters the authors could have done a better job of explaining how that chapter's topic could provide insight or tie into annoyance, but I did think the topics they chose are relevant to ""annoying things"" and was a nice initial review of possible places to start in the study of annoyance.

They did do a decent job of explaining some of the overly scientific stuff in layman's terms, but it wasn't really what I was expecting at all. It's one saving grace... It was barely 5 discs long, so at least it was over quick!"

For me, a non-musically inclined person, I had difficulty with the chapter regarding why we find fingernails on a chalkboard annoying. My favorite chapter was on social annoyances. An interesting and informative book. Since the study of annoyances in not very well studied, there were a lot of theories rather than conclusions. For example we find fingernails on a chalkboard annoying because ... The writing style was not textbook driven but for a regular reader with fun current analogies. "

This was a gift from my sister because she knows all too well how easily annoyed I am! I had hoped (based on vague promises on the jacket copy) that reading this would maybe alleviate my irritability for things like co-workers clicking their pens and such, but alas. It did not. At least I know there are some scientific reasons to help explain why my brain and nervous system responds the way it does. But I still want to punch people in the face sometimes."

It's far more anecdotal than empirical, even when case studies are cited. Still, it's an entertaining & often humorous read on a topic that affects each & every one of us.By the way, rather ironically, I was annoyed that the most-excellent book cover doesn't properly appear on my Facebook Timeline (instead, there's just a blank box). ;)"

Pop science about a field tangentially related to neurology? I'm there.I liked this book. It had enough science to make me feel like I learned something, and enough anecdotes to keep it from feeling boring. A lot of the factoids were ones I had red in articles or in other books, but I think this book has been out for a while, so that's not too surprising. It's not world-shaking, but it's a fun read."
74,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11427196-david,4,"This short book is a look at the science of the Annoying. Early on, it's clear that there is not yet a lot of scientific study in the area. Is ""being annoyed"" even a unique state different from, say, anger?There are at least a few good, memorable, points. For example, it was noted that traits that people find attractive early in a relationship often turn out to be the exact ones that are later found to be annoying.Any work that makes a good, memorable point deserves a good rating in my book."

But it wound up offering more factors of why different things annoy people. It could be culture, head injuries, chemical makeup or how everyone is wired. No real solutions. I was hoping for some insight into misophonia; insignificant sounds that drive people nuts, even rage. It’s a brain thing. The authors did mention the oxytocin receptor….which seemed to touch on misophonia. I can’t be sure. In the mean time I better get heavy duty headphones!"

From crying babies on airplanes, overheard cell phone conversations, even the sound of someone puking! the authors cover what is happening when we get and feel annoyed. I enjoyed the section on relationships and dating as well as the coverage of how animals display frustration and annoyance. "

One of the last sections in this book kind of explains for me why those idiots pull out in front of you when you are the only car on the road. It is in the section on cultural differences and why most cultures find Americans so annoying. Apparently we seem to have a me-first culture whereas others go more for the greater good attitude. At least that's my take on it and since I say so it must be right.;)

There is a lot of science, which I sometimes had trouble following. I also, unfortunately, found the female author's voice rather...um...annoying, which was ironic but also made it even harder for me to concentrate. I'd still recommend this to anyone who has to deal regularly with annoying situations since there is some good information."
80,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027063-elizabeth,4,"This is a great book with lots of fascinating information. If you love Mary Roach's (Stiff, Bonk, Packing for Mars) brand of scientific information mixed with hilarious anecdotes and jokes, you'll love it. Highly recommended if you want to read about precisely WHY something is annoying, tips for being less annoying, or how to guarantee you'll annoy someone. DON'T LET YOUR TEENAGERS READ, LOL. (Although most of them probably know how to drive you crazy already.)"
81,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5864362-xilks,3,"This book was really interesting. I've been meaning to read it for a long time and a learned a lot, not only about annoyances, but how they trigger and why they trigger us. I had a difficulty staying engaged with the reading for long periods of time, but the book was easy to pick up and put back down without feeling like I was forgetting anything.  I would suggest this book to anyone with a healthy sense of curiosity, or a person that gets annoyed easily. "
82,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7890768-sara,2,"This book has a very interesting topic and begins with interesting information. Nothing blew me away, unfortunately. Obviously much of this will seem like common sense to most, but even with that understanding, the presentation began to feel repetitive. I set the book down and haven't returned to it, so perhaps it has an exciting punch that I'm unaware of, but this book became lackluster. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in science but do not know much about it."

I got the book because Annoying is what my Granddaughter calls her brother. At first it was just a light, nicely written book; but as I read I found I was fascinated by all the subjects covered in the book. It is well written and researched and is a rich resource for all sorts of articles and other books I want to read. I obviously really enjoyed it."
84,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/533391-gemini,4,I thought this book was really great. I liked how it focused on the hearing irritants that I totally associate with. Understanding how they went through all of this w/out it being to scientifically over my head. I thought it was interesting how they tried breaking down what causes certain sounds or scents to be annoying. When speaking to other people about what they find irritating it was interesting to find out how certain things are more/less annoying to people.

Also there's not enough science in it. It's mostly just speculation... I'll read the next addition when they can actually tell me what parts of the brain light up on an fMRI :P

87,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178485-elizabeth,2,"Strangely, though it seeks to explain why and how humans become annoyed, this book does not address its own annoyingness--the annoyance of reading a book on an interesting topic that resorts to lame jokes and pat cultural assumptions more often than not. I need to stop reading popular psychology books. There has never been a good one. (Is that overstating it?)"
88,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"Not a book on 'how to' make life less annoying. Instead, this book is packed full of random information from studies done in the fields of behavioral science and neuroscience. I went into this audio book not really expecting much, and ended up being quite impressed. Anyone who's open to learning a bunch random information about the brain, should enjoy this book. "
89,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6317437-rebecca,2,"I'm not a regular audiobook listener, and I'm sorry to say I couldn't finish this. The file structure and interface with the iPod made it so I kept losing my place between listening sessions and the slow pace of exposition was, well, annoying.

90,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4445668-amanda,4,"A fun read about the feeling and science of annoyance. It was really interesting to read about some of the science being done to explore this particular, ubiquitous experience and how annoyance, on an intellectual-research level is tied to so many different things: genetics, life experiences, psychology. "
91,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613975-phair,2, This started out really interesting and fun but toward the end got bogged down in too much brain physiology stuff. And as to that cover shot of the ball of tangled christmas lights as a symbol of annoyance- I love untangling that sort of thing as well as knotted balls of yarn or string. I find it very calming and therapeutic.

Just one omission: how come they didn't mention leaf blowers, the most annoying thing in the entire universe? I wanted to lend the book to friends, but it kept mysteriously vanishing... it was really annoying. Maybe it morphed into an annoy-o-tron on my shelf? Highly recommended!"
93,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3129564-sharon,4,"Those of you who know me understand why this book appealled to me - I'm annoyed by so many things! The authors compile a wide variety of research on annoyance and irritability to explain a bit about how these emotions come about. Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions, but it is somewhat helpful to understand a bit more about the underlying mechanisms."

Having listened to so little non-fiction, I kept thinking it was a podcast =)My favorite part was about relationships and how the number one annoyance for most people is the thing that initially drew them together.

The subject of annoyance is actually quite an interesting one and this book explores it with a mixture of neurobiology, psychology, sociology as well as some less scientific speculation. Not a book that rocked my world but still a good read."

I didn't make the connection at the time, because I was shopping with my eyes instead of my brain, but it's basically a book about anger…duh…Anyway, it turns out that anger is super interesting topic, and one that I wish I had read a more substantial book about.

97,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8618401-april,2,"The science of annoyance is so nascent and exploratory at this point that the book overall lacks any satisfying conclusions.

I was more intrigued by the studies of human interaction rather than why we find certain noises or smells annoying.The author mixed a bit of humor in, which I don't think helped his credibility in a scientific book, but I appreciated it either way."
99,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253231-nena,4,"I'm sure a lot more could be written about what's annoying. I thought a lot of the points the authors made were interesting.

102,0470638699,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121696-emily,4,The author's tried to perform a very difficult task. They focused on many of the senses and sensations that make us feel annoyed. I found this book a little difficult to read but enjoyed it overall.

I guess I thought it would be more explanation of why we are annoyed, instead of the authors listing a bunch of things that people COULD find annoying, such as police/fire sirens, skunk smell or bugs. Kind of bland."
