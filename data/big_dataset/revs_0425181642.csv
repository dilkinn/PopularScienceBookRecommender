It is about an equation. E=mc2. There are lots of biographies of Einstein, and I think the best may have just been published(I am currently reading ""Einstein: His Life and Universe"" by Walter Isaacson.) But rather than write about the professor, Bodanis discusses each of the five elements of the equation. He also talks about the people and mini-dramas of science that led to the famous discovery in 1905. It is easy on science and numbers--which is fine for me. The hard-core readers can find number-crunching equations on the book's website. It is bursting with stories that are seldom heard in the textbooks--making it easy and fun read. While I don't agree with some of his conclusions in later chapters, he does make you think.I recommend this to any of my friends with the slightest bit of interest in physics. "

It's more a book about the atomic bomb which was something I was not expecting. For those of you expecting something more Physics-oriented, here's a quick rundown of the equation.There's a lot of confusion surrounding this equation caused by oversimplification. As it stands, the equation gives the energy equivalence of the mass of an object, and as this post goes on to say, there's a more complicated expression connecting energy and momentum in a reference frame in which the momentum is non-zero: E^2 = p^2c^2+m^2c^4. So yes, mc^2 gives the total energy only in the rest frame."

And this is truly an amazing biography of the Equation, of which Dr.Einstein would have had only a moderate knowledge. This book is a collection of stories of different thinkers, from the medieval period to the detonations of nuclear bombs, and how they happened to do it, from our history books. Many of which I had much more insight than what's in the book. This book contains a far little and juvenile scientific approach, which 'might' annoy certain people with a profound knowledge in Physics. But it also gave me many amazing details of certain discoveries."

4,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,A very well constructed story. Turned out to be of less scientific insight than I had hoped but was full of delightful historical factoids. Full review to follow.
5,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"This book is not what's advertised. It's mostly (counting pages) about the building of the first nuclear bomb. If you're into war history, you may like this book. If you want to learn about the equation E=mc^2, try reading a real science book. Which this is not.The author writes like an outsider looking in. I didn't feel like he had a firm grasp of the physics. He uses really poor analogies to try and describe the physics to the layperson instead of just explaining the physics like it is. Such half-wrong analogies are worse than useless because it later takes time to cure the lay reader of the resulting misconceptions. Why plant them in the first place?The book even ends on an anti-intellectual tone, where it's claimed Einstein was a ""profit"" bringing down knowledge from ""on high"". This is the absolute opposite of the truth. Physics is accessible to anyone who is interested enough to spend the time and energy it takes to learn.The author's apparent lack of expertise is also on display in the many subtle mistakes in the book. For example, he says that GPS satellites need a ""relativistic fix"" because the satellites are ""traveling so fast"". Sure, there's a 7 microsecond delay due to special relativity from their twice daily orbit around the Earth. But that's ignoring the larger, 45 microsecond delay due to general relativity from the Earth's gravity well! (source)I would go so far as to say this book contains ""scientism"". I hate that word and it's almost exclusively used inaccurately by Creationists. But it happens to fit what this book has in it. It's claimed, over and over again, that the bombs dropped on Japan were somehow due to the equation. Which they weren't. The discoveries of radioactivity and the theory behind radioactive criticality had nothing to do with the equation. That equation explains where the energy comes from in terms of a conservation law (mass/energy). But it's ridiculous to say the equation ""allowed"", ""enabled"", or ""caused"" nuclear bombs to detonate over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since it's the thesis of the book, this poor philosophy is repeated throughout the book. Each time I read that the equation ""made"" something possible, or that something happened as ""a result of"" the equation, I wanted to stab out my eyes with an ice pick."
6,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"It looks like I cannot get enough of Historical Science books. This is yet another book that surprised me. In this book, the Author presents History and the impact of Einstein's famous equation. He initially tries to give a decent historical account of how the equation came about. The book has its downsides. I really felt the equation could have been explained in much more exciting way than the Author did. But, I did like the fact that the Author focused in great detail about making of the Atomic Bomb (The Manhattan Project) and its destructive force that led to the surrender of Japan. Even though I was aware of most of the things described in this book from some of the other books I have read before, I still enjoyed going over them again thoroughly. Definitely a good read."
7,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4691042-care,4,"Quick Version: This book is a well laid out explanation of each part of the equation, its history, and its role in our universe.Long Version:The genesis of David Bodanis’ book was an interview he read in which actress Cameron Diaz expressed the desire-serious or in jest-to know what E=mc² really meant. Bodanis realized that the truth is that very few people have even a rudimentary knowledge of the usefulness of the world’s most famous equation; this book is his attempt to rectify that.The format chosen is an interesting one. Those who are true novices to physics-or lack interest in pursuing the equation beyond the basics-can read the front half of the book and walk away far more knowledgeable than they were when they picked it up. After a brief introduction to the time and place in which Einstein generated the paper which introduce the theory to the scientific world, Bodanis goes on to break down the equation and discuss each of its parts separately. What do they mean, and how do they interact with each other? The reader is then led on a quick trip through history with regards to how the scientific community used the theory-the race to be the first to build “The Bomb” during World War II. Finally, the author discusses the theory in our universe. Those not interested in a brain drain of a read would still likely read the Epilogue, which discusses what else Einstein did, and the interesting appendix, which gives closure regarding the other key participants.Of particular interest with regards to the structure of the book are the notes. If you would like to know more details (and are not afraid of either the odd equation or in depth descriptions), Bodanis suggests that you read the notes, where he has taken things a bit further. It is here that I have a bone to pick. The format that was chosen was that of endnotes, as opposed to footnotes. When endnotes are used, there is absolutely no indication within the text that there is a back of the book furtherance of the topic-two members of our book club did not even realize they were there and thus missed the opportunity to add to their reading experience. For those readers that do choose to read the endnotes concurrent with the front half of the book, you are left constantly flipping between the text and the notes to see if you have reached the next note (they are listed by page number). This is extremely disruptive to the flow of a book which requires some level of concentration to read and annoyed me to no end. Footnotes within the text would have been grand. As a side note, a member of our group tried to read the e-reader version. Footnotes would have enabled her to flip from text to notes with ease. As it was, she quickly gave up on trying to maneuver between the two.The final section, a guide to further reading, is one of the finest source guides I have ever seen. Books are divided into categories and are each given a paragraph of explanation designed to help the reader ascertain if they are a good fit for their reading list.Bodanis tops off his two leveled read with one final feat-he has a website to which he directs the serious student for further, more in depth, study. Whether you are interested in a basic explanation of a complicated theory, have a fascination with physics and would like to know more, or would like to go beyond your high school physics knowledge, this book is likely to fit your need."
8,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"I like science books so was eager to read E=mc2. This brief book follows the evolution of the equation E=mc2 from the germ of an idea that began in Einstein’s mind to the construction of the Atomic Bomb. Later on in the book the equation is used to explain such things as the scientific creation of earth, where stardust comes from and then on to black holes.One drawback to the scope here is that the book unintentionally reads like a series of articles. Covering this much scientific ground is hard to get right in a 200 page book. So some of the threads felt like teasers leaving me with wanting to know more.One sizable portion of the book was especially interesting. Perhaps one of the best reads that I have found describing the Nazi efforts to build the A-bomb and the Allied attempts to disrupt it. The book detailed the efforts of Heisenberg and the story of the British and Norwegian’s successive attempts to blow up the Nazi’s heavy water supplies.In another case I thought the vignette of Hoyle’s use of E=mc2 to derive the origins of star dust from supernovas was excellent. Where this book suffers is that the author is not a great storyteller and there are very few quotes in the book.There is also no math on the book beyond the profound equation itself which was disappointing. In fact I learned in my relativistic physics class more than 20 years ago that E=mc2 is not technically the correct equation. Rather it is a shortened equation. Of course the gist is valid but it would have been nice to see a little more consideration here given to the origins of the equation. I give this book 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 stars because the subject matter is interesting and the book is pretty short.For better books that cover the history of the A-bomb, although lengthy, I would recommend two that each won Pulitzer prizes. The first being Kai Bird’s American Prometheus: The Tragedy and Triumph of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Rhodes book on The Making of the Atomic Bomb."
9,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Bodanis, David. E=MC2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation (2000)Vivid, readable and compelling This is science history framed as a biography about Albert Einstein's famous equation, and an especially good read. Bodanis begins with Einstein in the Bern Patent Office in 1905, and then goes back in time to examine each of the elements in Einstein's equation in turn, starting with energy, followed by the equals sign, then mass, and then the speed of light (where I learned that the ""c"" is for ""celeritas,"" from the Latin for ""swiftness"" and not for centimeters--silly me, I always thought ""c"" represented the speed of light in centimeters!) and finally, squared.There are a number of stories woven into the narrative beginning with the story of Michael Faraday, who demonstrated the link between electricity and magnetism, and his mentor Humphrey Davy who tried to steal the priority from him. Other stories include that of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier whose fanatical insistence on exacting measurements led the world to the realization of the conservation of energy, a man who received his thanks by being beheaded during the French Revolution. And there is that of Ole Roemer, who with the help of Jupiter's satellite Io, was able to calculate the speed of light (despite denials from an embarrassed Jean-Dominique Cassini, who believed that light propagated instantaneously). There is the tale of Emilie du Chatelet, beloved of Voltaire, who persuaded everyone that Leibniz was right, that energy equals mass times velocity squared, not simply mass times velocity as Newton had it. Bodanis recalls how she became with child at age forty and feared for her life because the ""Doctors of the time had no awareness that they should wash their hands or instruments."" She gave birth but died of an infection a week later.The biography reaches its climax in the Manhattan Project. Bodanis gives a short but compelling story about how J. Robert Oppenheimer guided the US project to success, and a corresponding story about how the German effort under the direction of Werner Heisenberg failed. Along the way we get glimpses of other scientists involved in nuclear energy and radioactivity, including Ernest Rutherford, Enrico Fermi, James Chadwick, Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, Arthur Stanley Eddington and others. Fred Hoyle makes an appearance as does Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Bodanis paints some of the scientists in a most unflattering light, especially Hahn and Heisenberg, while glorifying others, notably Meitner, Chandra and Fermi. His sketch of Oppenheimer is balanced and vivid.Bodanis has the gift of making everything interesting, especially the personalities, but also the science itself. His description of the atomic bombs that were dropped on the Japanese cities and how they worked makes for compelling reading. In the Chapter ""America's Turn"" I learned that not everybody in the Allied Command agreed with Truman's decision to use the bomb: ""Even Eisenhower, who'd had no qualms about killing thousands of opponents when it was necessary to safeguard his troops, was strongly hostile to it..."" (p. 161).Some of the most interesting writing is in the footnotes, beginning on page 237. Here I found a most elegant digression on the Uncertainty Principle (pp. 273-74). And on page 280, Bodanis makes a vivid distinction between the naked properties of U238 (fifty pounds together are warm to the touch) and U235 (fifty pounds together leave a crater). And on page 275 he recalls the use of female slaves by the Germans during WWII: ""...the I. G. Farben combine purchased 150 women from the Oswiecim [Auschwitz:] concentration camp, after complaining about a price of 200 marks (then $80.00) each, and killed all of them in experiments with a soporific drug.""A number of black and white prints complement and enhance the text; an appendix, ""Follow-up of Other Key Participants"" shines more light on the scientists; and there is a useful 18-page ""Guide to Further Reading"" following the notes This is an highly informative excursion into the history of science made truly delectable by a gifted writer."
10,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44530411-vijayaraghavan-s-n,4,"We all have heard of the phrase ""match made in heaven"". But we limit its use mainly to couples. That very same phrase is applicable for this book too. Yes... Mr. Bodanis made a match out of 'History' and 'Science'.History has always been a constant thorn in my life. There isn't any other subject that I have hated more than History (Civics is not too far away in the second spot). But I was relieved from the daily nightmares of History classes once I passed my secondary education. Phewww.... sigh of relief. Right? No... Then came another headache in the form of Physics in my junior college. I could say I have spent a considerable chunk of time on deciding which subject I hated most. Physics or History? I am still searching for an answer.And then, years later (7 years to be precise), came a normal day in my PG course (a week or so back). My professor (who also happens to be my mentor) walked into the classroom and started talking about his struggles and how he hated thermodynamics and then the topic took a turn on to his PhD thesis. One thing lead to another which lead him to asking all of us if we have read the book E=mc2. Of the 13 students in my class, I can say I would be among the precious few who read books (mostly fiction, but a book is a book). No one raised their hands (not at all a surprise). Then he pointed at a few of us and made us sweat in shame by asking if we have ever gone through his library collection (which, btw, can be accessed by anyone of his students). I am not new to being shamed in class (for the right or the wrong reasons). But this hit me where it was supposed to hit not because he opened my eyes on how precious little I have read. But because there was a person of interest (for me) in the class and being mocked in front of that person was a dent in the mischievous plan that I am weaving. And that's how I took this book from his library at the very next week.Going by the cover I was taken back to my nightmares during secondary education and junior college. History and Science? That too together? Double nightmare time. But I still wanted to see what was so special about this. I read one page...Hmm...Interesting. Read the second page...Hmm...looks good. Then I kept on reading and turning pages. Before long I read half of the book. I didn't want to finish the book in a day. So I kept it aside and did ration reading (a phrase coined by me which means reading only a particular number of pages per day). I finished it within three days and I was left wondering why the author had to bring the book to an end.The word 'Biography' is truly made meaningful in this book. This books gives a detailed account on the birth, ancestry and adulthood of the equation. Are you wondering what BS am I talking? Why don't you find it out for yourself?Another book which blended History with science was 'Cosmos'. But that dealt with astrophysics mainly. And that branch of physics is something that I wish that I majored in. So, even if the book would have been a drab (which is far from the truth) I would still have enjoyed it. That makes this one all the more spectacular. Bringing two different areas, which I hate from head till toe, together.The only science book that I have read so far which didn't have any pictures and yet made sense to me what the author was saying. The way of writing followed in this book by linking scientists and different timelines together is something of a marvel.P.S. I have to thank Cameroon Diaz from the bottom of my heart. Once you read the first paragraph from the book, you would understand why."
11,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8570095-mark,2,"This is not a bad read, but it has some major flaws.For one, this book is aimed at kindergartners.Fay Weldon, in an ebullient blurb, claims that by reading this book she achieved an understanding of Einstein’s theory of relativity “by osmosis”. I’m afraid my brain does not work that way. For me, insight is based on facts, concepts and reasoning. And some concepts are not easy, and some sophisticated reasoning is sometimes necessary to ""get"" a difficult theory. In principle, even very hard concepts can be explained in simple terms, but it takes a very talented and patient author to do this well.Mr Bodanis does not rise to the challenge. He aims his book squarely at readers who have no mathematics, no physics and no chemistry whatsoever, and who are not expecting to pick up any here. For instance, he patiently explains the concept of squaring: four squared is not eight but, don't be surprised, sixteen. Any concept more difficult than this he is afraid to tackle, so most of what we get are broad generalizations, egregious simplifications, rough approximations, not-very-apt similes and repetitions.On page 50, the author suddenly asserts “That’s why it’s speed can be an upper limit” [he’s talking about the speed of light here] and a few pages further on “That’s what explains ‘c’ in the equation” [light again]. Alas, nothing in the preceding paragraphs or pages warrants these bold statements: we know the speed of light IS an upper limit, but WHY that is so not even the most intelligent and dedicated reader will have fathomed, there simply not being enough explanatory power applied here.Another thing I find grating in a science book is that Bodanis loves to talk about God whenever given half a chance. He comes up with a highly original take on Michael Farraday’s work on magnetism : it was inspired by his Sandemanian religious beliefs. Scientists are used to think in straight lines, Bodanis posits, but in church the circle is more important: “I will help you, and you will help the next person, and that person will help another, and so on until the circle is complete”. So that’s why Michael went looking for circular lines around his magnets, duh! Somehow I am not surprised no historian of science ever thought of this before.And while Bodanis does not discuss Einstein’s religious beliefs explicitly, he disingenuously suggests that the latter was a believer. Twice he mentions that The Wild Haired One referred to God as “The Old One”, and he ends his book with a sentence strongly suggesting Einstein was a theist (…the divine library that he was convinced awaited…). In fact, though he disliked the label “atheist” and on occasion flirted with pantheism, Einstein called a belief in a personal god “childlike” and often defined himself as an agnostic. If you made it this far down my review, you earned this confession: I only scored this book two stars to mark my displeasure with the overblown blurb on the cover, and the overly generous score on Goodreads. In fairness, this merits three stars. There are some good stories here, competently told. The author gives pride of place to female scientists whose contributions were at one time underappreciated, which is laudable of course. And the voluminous notes at the end of the book partly offset my criticism about egregious simplification.So if you find this in a yard sale, go ahead, spend a few cents, it is worth a read. But it has some major flaws. (Da capo)"
12,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66810204-philip-mills,5,This book is well written and the information is presented in an easily understandable manner. It felt like a kindly uncle was explaining physics to his not so bright nephew. I enjoyed it a great deal and felt I achieved a better understanding of the complex equation. 
13,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1093061-rabbitprincess,4,"* * * 1/2How does one write the ""biography"" of an equation? Sure, it's ""born"" whenever the person invents it, but equations can't exactly grow up, marry and die, at least not in the way living things can. David Bodanis's approach to biography is to first explain each part of the equation (E, =, m, c2) and the scientific developments that led to these elements being used in common scientific parlance, and then to trace the history of the whole equation, from when Einstein first developed it to how the universe will eventually end, in keeping with the principles of the equation.This was a very satisfactory book. I learned a lot about some of the early French scientists, like Lavoisier, Emilie du Châtelet (who was great! people need to know about her) and Henri Poincaré, as well as some other unsung female scientists such as Cecilia Payne, whose sexist thesis advisor made me want to go back in time and smack him. There was even a WW2 commando raid! I love when those show up in unexpected places in my reading. In this case it was on a heavy water plant in Norway, which was part of the Germans' effort to build an atom bomb.From a scientific standpoint, the most memorable chapters were the one where Bodanis explains in subatomic detail exactly how the bomb dropped on Hiroshima wrought its horrific damage, and the one where he explains how the universe will end. The latter is probably not the best thing to read right before bed, because it's kind of depressing.So the question is, how much scientific background do you need to appreciate this book? Well, there is a certain amount of detail when he explains the physics behind the equation, but overall I'd say if you were fine with the physics/Big Bang part of Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, this would be a good follow-up. "
14,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,5,"I'm not quite sure why I keep going back to these history of science books, but I enjoy them. E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation is pretty much what it says. But if you're looking for just another Albert Einstein biography, author David Bodanis is mostly going to disappoint you here. It's more like a biography of the eponymous equation, examining each term (heck, even the equal sign) in great detail and giving a thorough accounts of the history of each piece and the impact it has had on modern living.The book strikes just the right balance between physics lessons (don't worry, there's no math) and explaining the scientific achievements leading up to and following in the wake of the equation's discovery. I'm hard pressed to think of a subject that would include French aristocrats getting beheaded over the construction of a wall, Madam Curie's radioactive cookbooks, high-brow academic bickering, and detailed discussions of how make uranium atoms asplode real good. My favorite part was something that actually sounds more like the final level in some World War II video game than a physics textbook: a small group of Norwegian commandos (actually mostly former plumbers and machinists) creeping into a heavy water factory in order to sabotage it and derail the Nazis' 1942 atomic weapon program.It's all very thorough and very readable and I had no idea that there was so much that went into and came out of the fact that mass and energy are the same thing in two different forms. The end of the book even looks forward billions of years to show how the equation predicts the Earth will end (in flames as the Sun gives one final cosmic belch) and how the universe itself will eventually sputter to a stop. But don't worry, you'll be long dead."
15,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209363-susan-from-md,4,"The book is definitely for non-physicists and it takes a new approach to describing the equation, the Theory of Relativity (General and Special), and how the equation is applied. The first section takes each of the components of the equation and gives a brief history, often by way of a scientist who worked on that particular component. The next sections follow the ""life"" of the equation from its early days through current applications - from discussions of space-time to the atomic bomb to black holes to a mention of the unifying theory.Having read several books on similar topics, I found this to be a fun and interesting approach. Given that it focuses on the people as well as the equation, and does not get to into the tech-y aspects of the physics and math behind the equation, it has more of a gossipy quality to it. Now, if you are looking for a ""popular"" book on physics that really gets into describing complex things for the (somewhat informed) masses, this book may not be for you. But, it you would like something that takes a light-hearted approach to how the universe works, give it a try.(view spoiler)[You may even get an evil chuckle out of seeing that Otto Hahn ""lost"" his element on the periodic table and Lise Meitner got one!

17,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5042824-joseph,1,I should state that I am not the sort of reader this author had in mind when he wrote this book. He cites actress Cameron Diaz saying that she would like to know what E=mc2 means. So not written for a PhD engineer. Still . . .It should be possible to write a book that explains the science without simplifying to the point of misleading.Without focusing on a small number of historical persons and giving them credit for advances that were not theirsWithout making some seem more like mystics than scientists or intellectuals.
18,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,A very entertaining read. The book is about some of the people and discoveries that made it possible for Einstein to come up with his famous equation. Then it discusses some of the ramifications of his famous formula. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
19,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14797422-jarek,3,"Looking at other reviews of this book it's apparent that it allowed many of its readers to finally understand the famous equation. Apparently I'm either too stupid or too inquisitive, but my experience was quite different. In my opinion this is mostly a history book, just like one could expect from its subtitle ""A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation"". It provides comprehensive historical background, spiced up with a lot of little known facts about people, whose work eventually contributed to the formulation of the special relativity theory. It also broadly discusses the consequences of this development, with particular attention given to the race between the Nazis and the US to create the first nuclear bomb.However, when it comes to the actual equation, the book only skims the surface and mostly wanders around vague borders between physics, cosmology and philosophy. It does not offer any math beyond this deceptively simple equation nor does it explain how the equation relates to the formulas describing the relationship between energy, mass and velocity we learned at school. The book is a well written biography, and if you are interested in the history of science you will probably enjoy it. However, how anyone could learn any physics from this book remains beyond my comprehension."
20,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14536914-roshan,5,"This book includes the history behind the theory proposed by Albert Einstein in his miracle year, 1905. The different transcripts and citations help us to draw a conclusion that E=mc^2 came into existence due to thorough contributions from Einstein's predecessors. It was a team work spread over a period of two and half centuries. Sir Isaac Newton was the first one to initiate research in the domain, which was later carried forward by the Faradays and the Rutherfords. Albert Einstein was instrumental not only in proposing a strong logic behind E=mc^2, but was also the pioneer of Quantum Physics. David Bodanis puts forth the ideas behind each of the symbols; E, =, m, c, and square in this book. A very different kind of biography which lays emphasis on derivation of an equation. Of course, t h e y s a i d i r o n a g a i e n is the most interesting part of the book. An excellent Science manuscript which evolves by itself chapter by chapter to give rise to the most powerful equation ever discovered by mankind. E=mc^2 is indeed a revelation in itself. David Bodanis deserves a high five for this compilation."

It had such an impressively daunting title that I couldn't have explained except that it has something to do with Einstein. However, I am confident that I could explain the basics of this equation after reading this book. In addition, it has motivated me to find out more of how this equation influenced history of World War II. The fact that Einstein could relate mass and energy through the speed of light squared just by thinking about it and not doing any experiments, mostly makes him an interesting person. What also makes him an interesting person is also quoted as saying that if he had known his equation would have been used for such destruction as the atomic bomb that he would not have lifted one finger to write it. "
22,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Bodanis' new look at an old equation resulted in a surprisingly fantastic book. Not only did it trace the ancestry of E=mc2, but it provided the best biography of women in the early sciences that I have read to date. Through reading Bodanis' perspective on the collaboration of a theory that allowed us to understand how energy turns into matter and matter into energy, I came to unexpectedly love scientists Emilie du Châtelet, Cecilia Payne, and others in deeper way than before. Though I already loved Voltaire, I love him even more after reading this book. Some of the stories told in this book read like a novel. These stories continue to stay with me and haunt me, taking up a lot of real estate in my brain. When a book has such a strong hold on me the entire time I am reading it and beyond, it is such a gift. What an unexpected treasure. This is now an absolute favorite of mine! "
23,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855874-greg,4,"I'll say it - biographies are generally a bore, so you would think that a biography about a physics equation would be worse than televised Bingo. Instead, Bodanis presents a rather unexpected dive into an equation, its origins, its meaning, and its consequences. He delves into all sorts of interesting tangents, like the origin of the ""="" sign, and explains everything in a down to Earth manner. I learned that this equation has a rich history of drama, war, and power. Dangerous covert operations were conducted just to keep the right kind of water out of the wrong hands. It turns out that this simple equation is a lot more interesting than it first looks.I recommend this book for anyone with a casual interest in science history."
24,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845048-noah,4,"A very accessible introduction to the ideas behind the equation that everyone knows, but very few actually understand. I love reading science books like this: light on the math and heavy on the anecdotes. Even though I'm familiar with a good deal of the content, and have read about it in a great deal more depth elsewhere, it's great to review such a complicated set of ideas in a new way and the premise (a chapter for each component of the equation) is really fun. It won't do much for the hardcore physics fan, but the layperson or casual science fan will enjoy the read and may even make some surprising discoveries along the way."
25,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25492705-damien-walker,4,"This is one of the better explorations of Einstein's work on mass-energy equivalence, especially if you're less interested in the maths and more interested in what E=mc2 actually means. It's very readable, assumes little prior knowledge and does a great job of exploring the meaning of each element of the equation - what are E, m and c? He even explains where = came from.Bodanis writes well and does as good a job of visualising and explaining some pretty abstract concepts. He wanders a little at times, and perhaps judges Werner Heisenberg a little more harshly than necessary, but it's still an outstanding book in a very crowded genre. "

This really helped pull things together for me, such as what we read about in Feynman's ""Six Easy Pieces"" and what ""heavy water"" is. The book is set up as a biography, so it goes through the history behind the pieces of the equation--even the equals sign!--and then through the life of the equation itself. Along the way, Bodanis includes stories about the people involved (Lavoisier, Faraday, Einstein, and many others) that really add color and interest.The author explains the scientific concepts clearly, even for my less-scientific mind. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who reads. You'll feel much more informed when you finish it!"

31,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58551106-christian-williams,5,"Bodanis does a fine job of guidance through the thicket, determined not to resort to equations and to find everyday analogies illustrating the substance of the E=mc2 insight--which is apparently that energy equals matter (just as the equation says!). That equivalence was previously unknown to science, although probably every schoolkid today accepts it in the age of atomic power and the image of the Hiroshima bomb. How very small objects of mass can turn into such prodigious energy is revealed in the power of the c2 speed-of-light multiplier: in terms of mph, 450,000,000,000,000,000.Good book. Some of the insights even stick for the casual reader. "
32,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10534900-raj,4,Ever wondered how this simple yet world defining equation born? Was this something Einstein just plucked out of the air or was this evolved over the time? How each one of the elements in that equation was deduced and when and who before this famous equation was formed? Why this equation is beautiful yet it is scary? How Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed because of this equation and how this equation is going drive the earth to its end?All these questions are answered in a scholarly yet in a very easily readable form (took me just 3 days of time to finish this book). The author covers the history of science from Faraday to Einstein and post-Einstein but never exhausts the reader with too many science jargon. His way of presenting the facts in a friendly tone makes this book highly readable.Highly recommended.
33,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713980-carey-louise,5,"Approachable, interesting, entertaining, engrossing . . . And this book is about an equation! Absolutely fantastic. Thank you, David Bodanis!"
34,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35328956-sasanka,4,"Great read. Felt a lot more informed about world now. Best part of the book is the ease with which author engages non science background readers. I was particularly impressed by some characters like Lise Meitner, Micheal Faraday etc. Thorouly enjoyed all through and strongly recommend everyone to pick this one."
35,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30667391-rob,5,"In popular culture, Einstein’s name is synonymous with the word genius. His famous equation of E=mc2 is likewise equally known but admittedly little understood other than in a very fundamental sense. This book offers a chance for the layman to grasp the components of this famous theorem of Albert’s in a very novel and thoroughly entertaining manner.Each component of this equation is broken down into individual histories, starting with an explanation of the concepts behind the symbol E, representing “energy,” this is then explored throughout its first origins to the latter day expansions upon the idea with short brief bios on the people behind each leap of understanding. Subsequently, each symbol is likewise explored in exacting detail. In this way the reader could possibly arrive at a clearer understanding of this brilliantly deceptive short equation. Then again, maybe not, as it is often said that the more we know, the less we really understand, especially so when it comes to the field of science. Regardless, the journey of discovery here is amazingly entertaining, as well as surprisingly funny at times, all of which makes this an absolute must read for anyone with an interest in science from the universities to streets.Here, we learn that a great many mathematicians and scientists were essentially borderline lunatics and their stories are about as intriguing as reading about the inhabitants of an overrun insane asylum. However, aside from this more sensational aspect, the book is genuinely fascinating even when not detailing the crazies and is written in a very accessible manner.Sir Isaac Newton is attributed to have once said that we are nothing more than “dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants.” The dominant interpretation of this metaphor is that he was essentially belittling the accomplishments of his day, including his own, in comparison to those that went before him. Basically, we all build upon the successes and failures of other peoples work and owe them a debt of gratitude. This book pays tribute to some of these individuals, many of which are little known by the general public due to Einstein’s enormous shadow.However, rather than a glorified “Great Men” version of history, this books tends to show that more often than not, a great many of the most important discoveries were actually done by mere hobbyist with a serious streak of curiosity or otherwise completely uneducated laymen whose field of study could not have been more outside of the specific field of study of science.I find this encouraging, as well as very telling in another way. First of all, those giants that Newton referred to were sometimes very small and humble in their day to day life and were no different than you and I. They were simple everyday people, whose only real claim to fame was that they dared to ask why and tried to answer a question that aroused their interests. This is what I find encouraging, if not actually inspiring in this book, for if more of us did our own thinking in the same way without differing to people supposedly more knowledgeable than us then just maybe even more discoveries can be made in a variety of fields, not just in science.Lastly, what I get out of this book is that sometimes when you look too hard at a problem by studying it from every conceivable angle the answer only gets farther away. We sometimes just need to relax and take a simple bath like Archimedes was made to by his wife in the oft told famous story in order to think of less important things. Then, the answer may miraculously come of its own accord in the process. Furthermore, not to oversimplify a truth that I’m straining to arrive at here, but sometimes an education hinders the thought process into complete blindness to the heart of the matter one is seeking. Figuratively, it sometimes may take a curious janitor looking over the shoulder of the great man who is slaving away tirelessly over a particular problem to find the solution that is staring him right in the face. A simple illustration showing very clearly that one should always respect everyone’s viewpoint and opinion regardless of their background or profession. It is quite conceivable that they may actually have something to teach you no matter what you think you may know already."
36,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75982374-barry-dwolatzky,4,"I enjoyed the book and appreciated the high level overview of events and personalities who shaped the history of modern physics. I did find bits of it a little too ""dumbed down"" ... But that is what the author set out to do. I recommend it to those who want to gain some insights into Einstein's big ideas."
37,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8212860-vinc,4,"For the ones, who look under the surfaceI always hated to learn and calculate the formulas for physics and mathematics in school. So why would I deal with it in my free time?This is a book about the world’s most famous equation that nearly everyone can recite, but almost no one can explain it correctly and comprehensibly. David Bodanis explains us much more than the origins and consequences of Einstein’s discovery that mass and energy are interchangeable, and that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. In fact, the author introduces the reader to the assortment of characters who contributed to the understanding of the equation’s single parts. Therewith Bodanis doesn’t only credit the contributions of forgotten scientist, he rather makes the previously confusing math to a descriptive and easy to handle tool, since we know its history from early on.To get the feeling where the equation’s origins are and why Einstein did what he did helped me a lot to understand e=mc^2. Throughout the book i acquired a taste for this method of step by step history. In this way, every single part is associated with its role. Indeed, understanding each piece makes it easier to understand the entirety.Nevertheless, I have to express criticism on this part, too. Unfortunately, the author enlarges upon the contributors too much, what creates the feeling of drifting away from Einstein’s equation and rather points to another topic. As a reader I wish Bodanis would have made more associations with the equation, which would have led to a clear and straight outline of the book. The drifting from the topic harms the reading flow and gave me a feeling of swaying; not really knowing where I am going and how to file the information.The step by step explanation continues to take its course throughout the book. As the author begins to deal with the more tragically part of the book, the construction of a nuclear bomb, I really appreciated the granularity. Whereby Bodanis confuses in the first part of the book, the details are necessary and make the the topic “nuclear disaster” vivid. I really appreciate the fact that nothing is belittled and the truth of this cruelty is depicted. For this reason I realized for the first time, that e=mc^2 doesn’t only heat up my mac & cheese in the microwave, but it killed millions of people by the use in a nuclear bomb. I have to give the author a lot of credit for the six page long description of what happened in the seconds after the bomb was triggered over Japan: there, Bodanis slows down time, as a chemical chain reaction altered our world forever. This is my favorite part because of the clear description of the reaction; not only on chemistry level, but on a level of humanity, ethnicity and the meaning of life.Unfortunately, the ending comes too early after the detonation and the book is chopped by two pages. Here, the book could use a clear conclusion, which fades the reading flow away more harmonically.All things considered, this book is a very good pick for readers of every level of knowledge on the equation, who want to grasp the meaning of the equation beyond the characters of “e=mc^2”."
38,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,5,"Five years ago I would have thought it strange to be reading the biographies of numbers and equations. But then I read the biography of Zero, and now, here is the biography of the famous equation E=mc2.You wouldn’t think there would be much to the biography of an equation. But the author gives the details of how the individual terms came to be defined and recognized, and when and by whom, including the concept of squaring numbers and why the speed of light needs to be squared for this equation. Then he goes into how Albert Einstein came to put the various terms together to describe the conversion of mass into energy.In the case of this equation, there is a further history as well, as it became instrumental in the creation of the atom bomb. So we are treated to the incremental discoveries that led from E=mc2 being just a nice theoretical equation on paper or on a blackboard somewhere to the creation of the atomic bomb. This includes the lesser known story of the Germans’ attempt to create a bomb during World War II and how that was finally sabotaged amid great danger and loss of life. I always had the impression that it had turned out that the German effort had never gotten as far as the Allies feared it had when they were working on their own bomb, but it seems it was a closer call than we thought.There is an interesting follow-up on many of the people involved in the story of the equation and what happened to them after they played their part in defining the various terms or building the bomb or whatever.One thing I found surprising was that among the scientists involved in various areas of discovery related to the equation there were at least four women involved to a greater or lesser degree. Except for Marie Curie, whose involvement was fairly peripheral and accidental, I had never heard of any of them before. Emilie du Châtelet had a castle that she made into a research center and money and title, so she was a respected researcher in scientific circles in her day, but her contributions were gradually forgotten over the years. The real surprise was that the women scientists whose work was most shamefully appropriated by others were the ones working in the twentieth century.I found this book on Scribd. "
39,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96472-emily-ann-meyer,4,"This was an increadibly engaging, abosorbing, and fully readable book for so esoteric a subject. The author broke down each element of the equation devoting a chapter to E (and how scientists found that energy is energy, is energy regardless of the form it takes - and also the wave rather than linear concept thereof) a chapter to = (yes the equals sign), a chapter to m basically getting into the laws of conservation of matter, a chapter to c (the constant of the speed of light - put it in terms that were easily understood) and then a chapter to ^2 which really fascinated me inasmuch as it got into the whys and wherefors of the earlier equation of f=mv^2, and how it was Voltaire's lover that found that the ^2 mattered when Newton had created f=mv . . . and it was a really simple study that revealed it. (Dropping balls into clay and measuring how far they sank). The book then went on to describe the reception of Einstein's paper in which he proposed the theory of relativity, and then got into the most chilling and practical application thereof - in 1939 - 34 years after he originally wrote it -- with atomic weapons. I found it interesting, I learned a lot more than the cursory ""the Americans and the Germans were in a race to harness the power of nuclear fission and weaponize it and the Americans won working through something called the Manhattan project"" -- it got into some of the personalities behind that and some of the Allied sabotage of the German efforts without which the Americans probably would not have won. There was a great appendix which gave postscripts on most of the people introduced in the book and a thorough reading list at the end. Really, a very enjoyable book for a subject that has the potential to be incredibly dense. I've seen a review say there were factual errors, and that I can't address - but it's not written to be a text book. It's written for the lay reader. Were I to want to learn more, there's a giant list of suggested reading at the end. Some of which I'm probably going to hit. But for an overview, it was WONDERFUL."

I have never read such an entertaining book where I felt such a passion towards science. I have always hated science in the past two years in high school. But this book really opens my eyes to the beauty of this simple equation with splendid stories and history contexts. This book is very interesting because the author, David Bodanis takes a very unique approach in explaining the meaning of this equation, E=mc2. “Instead of using the rocket ship-and-flashlight approach, I could write the biography of E=mc2. Everyone knows that a biography entrails stories of the ancestors, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood of your subject. It's the same with the equation.” Says Bodanis in his preface. Each letter of the equation E=mc2 represents something, such as ""E"" is the energy equal to the ""M"", mass in earth, with different historical stories. The twists and turns were created in the development of this equation, making this book not only unique, but surprising entertaining. Reading this book not only taught me the beauty of a simple equation, but also brought me to a estate where I get to know the most well-known scientist of all time, Albert Einstein. Einstein was not only obnoxious in school, but he was also unable to take care of his wife and child when he was in his late twenties. This rises my curiosity on how a troubled scientist discovered the most famous equation of all time? After all, I must emphasize that I enjoyed reading this book, it was a joy. It makes me fall in love with the beauty of a simple equation. It is something magical, as if a mother watched her child grow. This book makes me like physics, something that I want to dig deeper into in the future. I would like to recommend this book to anyone!"
41,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39682821-jim-lavis,4,"The thrills of being in the queue at Houston’s court house:A couple of weeks ago I was summons for jury duty, so while in line, seeing if I was going to be selected, a gentleman in his early sixties was reading this book titled “E=MC2.” I overheard him sharing that he was enjoying it, so that was enough to get my curiosity up.I guess this book is an expansion of a book I read a few weeks ago titled “A Brief History of Time” by Steven Hawking. I don’t believe this book was written as well as Hawkins’ book, but it had some amazing items in it that just astonished me.For example, the atomic boom we dropped on Japan in World War II exploded 2,000 feet above the earth. In addition, militarily we didn’t even need to drop this boom to win the war, so I guess tens of thousands of lives could have been saved. Furthermore, we dropped it directly over a hospital, but that’s really a moot point considering the power and velocity of this weapon.More importantly, this book helps me with my understanding of the world and universe we live in. It’s fascinating to glimpse or even think about different dimensions of space and time within our universe. Let alone how the big bang theories apply to our current space in time, and how our universe is developing.I mean how does one capture the depths of this in just a few paragraphs? All I can say is OMG, there is so much to learn. Keep it coming."
42,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233835-marcie,4,"I just sat at Dean & Deluca reading this through. It was a book I had stolen from a guest (not very nice, I know, but I had to read it once I saw the title. I'm working on a new art piece based partly on physics.) It is a really interesting book on the history of the science behind the equation and then how it has been used since. It's partly a little lesson in physics for us non-scientist types. (I do seem to know a lot of physicists so it's useful information for parties.) And a little heartning (for me) to know just how many phyicists aren't that great at math. The big ideas seem to come about by looking at a problem from a different direction than the accepted one (then having that idea stolen by the same people who said your ideas were crazy.)Speaking of which, it also made me realize how many women of science go unrecognized. Those who made really outstanding discoveries let alone all the turn-of-the-century spinsters in the backrooms of Harvard used as early ""computers"" They did the tedious job of measuring the distance to the stars but were not allowed to take more advanced math classes or even marry if they wished to keep their jobs. (Poor spinsters, they always seem to get the short end of the stick!) Good suggested reading list which I will now become obsessed with. Have I found another WWI? "
43,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595470-david,2,"Call it 2.5 stars.This book falls somewhere in no-man's-land for me. It simplifies science for accessibility, but in doing so it loses much of the power to awe that science has. The author starts by giving definitions for each part of Einstein's famous equation, telling what it is and its role in the formula. Then the middle third of the book goes into great detail about the development of atomic weapons: the first human-based application of the concept of turning mass into energy. The final section covers (very briefly) the main examples of nuclear fission and fusion in the natural world, from radium's discovery to smoke detectors to medical isotopes to the sun's awesome energy.Unfortunately, these latter portions of the book are told with such simplicity that they fall flat. In his attempt to keep concepts simple, the author misses the chance to emphasize how really amazing E = mc^2 is. The wonder of science is stripped away, rather than accentuated by the tale being told.I say the book falls in no-man's-land because, although accessible to any reader at any age or level of scientific knowledge, those interested in the subject and the science can surely find a better, more lively explanation and discussion of the subject elsewhere. It's not a bad book per se--it's just not a great one, either."
44,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,5,"This book made me fall in love with physics all over again. Much like spinning together a crazy plot or fairy tale, scientists must think ""out-of-the-box"" in order to take a theory to the next level. You kind of feel lighter than air as you read about their thought process. I loved picturing Einstein at his home with his newborn son on his knee, plotting how light affects the conversion from mass to energy. There is something fantastic about equations--the way all the pieces fit together is quite inspiring. Bodanis also describes how the atomic bomb was developed and other applications of of E=mc(squared). Anyway, Bodanis is one of my favorite authors. I would also recommend his book about Emilie du Chatlet and Voltaire. He manages to merge science with history and make his vignettes come alive with oodles of odd factoids and anecdotes. I see here that one reviewer thought that some of the mathematics in this book were incorrect. For me, I wasn't as concerned with accuracy, preferring to read about how people solve problems, build off of each others ideas, and how jealous and ego-centric scientists can be. A great read. "
45,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3216-danielle,3,"I'd give this a 3.5. I found the beginning to be a little slow, but once the book moved more into people's lives and the rush for the A-bomb things really picked up. One thing to note is the enthusiasm of the author. I never expected to see so many exclamation points in a book about science, but maybe that's just because I lack imagination. While at times Bodanis seems to lay it on a little thick, there are parts of the book in which I genuinely shared his enthusiasm. Learning about the practical uses of E=mc2 is something many books leave out, but understanding what exactly is going on inside a nuclear warhead really was fascinating. I also loved hearing about the torrid affairs that affected many of the contributing scientists, especially the ladies. I guess if you were free/rich enough to be a British female scientist in the 17th/18th century, you probably had the freedom to do just about whatever the hell you wanted (and boy did they!). Get passed the first 1/4 of the book and the ridiculous number of times this man says E=mc2 followed by an exclamation point, and you'll enjoy this book quite a bit."
46,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12809584-david-plunkett,5,"I picked ""A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation"" for my Goodreads project. I believe the Author's purpose in this novel was to present facts about the creation of Einstein's Equation, E=MC Squared, and the events leading to the making of the Atomic Bomb. The theme of this story was to give the reader information as to how Einstein's Famous Equation was created. This novel also presented knowledgeable facts as to why Einstein created this equation. The Author used the style of narration which means he put all of his events in chronological order. This novel took you step by step through Einstein's process of creating this equation. I thought that this book was a great book for anyone interested in Physics, Mathematics, and other Sciences. I liked this book because I am interested in being a Theoretical Physicist and this novel included a great deal of information about this career. If I were to change anything about the book, it would be not to cram so many years worth of information and facts into a 219 page book. This book is similar to the book that is called ""Understanding Quantum Mechanics"". Both novels are mainly about Physics and Mathematics. "
47,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7932839-glen-robinson,5,"What you get with this fascinating look is not only at what each of the segments of the equation represents, but a biography on Albert Einstein, what led him up to his discovery and helpful stories of other physics pioneers such as Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, Galileo, and others who led up to the formula that ushered in the nuclear age and changed our world forever. In addition, it had an intriguing section on the Nazi heavy water production in Norway in World War II and the Allies continuing efforts to destroy their plant in an impregnable location.What’s also nice is that rather than bogging the book down with ancillary information that not every reader might want to slog through, it focuses on the basic story that most people might want to hear. Then at the end, it offers up an appendix, telling more about the physicists and other individuals that are talked about in the book, and what happened to them later on in their own stories. After that, it also includes an extensive notes section that fleshes out the information provided in the main part of the story for those who want more. A lot of it is fascinating reading."
48,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171587-janelle,5,"If you're like me, you just like to know. This book explains the famous equation in a very understandable manner and gives such awesome background into s huge array of areas. It begins by explaining the history of each of the components of the equation which takes the reader into the lives of different scientists who were involved in determining the nature of mass or the speed of light for example. You'll learn about Einstein's role and then how the equation takes on a life of its own as Rutherford learns how to split the atom and later the race to build an atomic bomb impacts WWII. I enjoy learning of women who contribute. Emilee du Chatelet, a female scientist heavily influenced and involved;) with Voltaire plays a large role in establishing why velocity must be squared. While it's a science book, it's not a bore like you've read in any of your science classes. I found myself caught up in the lives of all the people who knowing,y or unknowingly will forever be connected to the equation."

The book was well written, but the actually history is actually fascinating as well. My favorite parts of the book are the fact that there were quite a few women profiled and the story of the Norwegian Resistance during WWII.One thing that I had to keep reminding myself while reading, was the fact that the book is about the equation, so people's stories and the history of certain discoveries are only discussed in so far as they connect with the equation. But there is a huge reference list at the end of the book in order to do additional reading on any of the topics or people mentions. "
50,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3596877-michelle,4,"Really fairly good. It had a discussion at the end as to whether or not Truman should have used the atom bomb; the argument was fairly convincing against such use, but I'm honestly not well-versed on the subject. I'd always heard that the use of the bomb was considered to be essential in order to end WWII and prevent huge losses of American lives. Still a fairly good book. The PBS series by the same title which was aired a few years ago was also good, but sometimes rather silly. My girls and I watched it, and some of the romantic scenes were rather full of ""fluff"" and had nothing to do with the science involved. Nor did they add to the interest. Adults and kids could watch that series and be every bit as interested in the subject matter without having to watch Lavoisier and his wife exchange sexual innuendos with one another over their study of the law of the conservation of mass. Still good history on Faraday, Lavoisier, and the rest, leading up to Einstein himself."

I tend to lean more towards short stories and fantasy, but this author proved he could capture my attention with science. The main reason for his success was that this book is not about complicated math and physics only an honor student can comprehend. This book is about the stories of the people who contributed to Einstein's development of his theory. Bodanis takes each portion of the equation ""E,"" ""m,"" ""c,"" ""2,"" and even the ""="" and he tells how someone in history thought of it and pushed the world a little closer to Einstein's theory, until ultimately Einstein himself pulled it all together. At the same time Bodanis draws you in to the lives of these contributors; the world around them and why their discoveries were important. You do not have to be a scientist to understand this book, but you will walk away from it with a better understanding of the equation."

And it goes to a completely different level when it comes from finally understanding what you believed was not your cup of tea.Thank you Afshan, for E=mc2 had shattered all my notions of physics and has reintroduced me to the subject that I had given up on long ago. The book, as expected, is loaded with history, facts, and numbers. But, it also has people, their experiences, their lives and times, their thoughts, their stories..everything from the perspective of E=mc2. The book is a treasure box of anecdotes, pictures, small details, and simple yet effective writing style.If the same style of breaking complex ideas into simplest forms could be adopted in academics, people like me would have had happier school days with no particular dislike for a subject.Thanks once again, Afshan! This is one of the best birthday gifts ever."
53,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/586014-thomas,4,"It sounds like a book about physics, but it's really more about the lives of the scientists that revolved around this famous equation. Some of them -- Faraday, Lavoisier, Maxwell -- laid the foundations leading up to Einstein's pivotal theory. Some of them -- Oppenheimer, Chandrasekhar -- follow up on it. Bodanis acknowledges as well the accomplishments of women like Emilie du Chatelet, Lise Meitner and Cecilia Payne, all of whom faced additional challenges because they were women doing serious, sometimes crucial, work in a ""man's world."" The overall treatment creates a history, rather than a physics text. Bodanis explains basic theory in terms simple enough that you don't need a math or physics background to get the gist of it. And that's fine, because the focus here is on the progress (for good or ill) of the human species and our understanding of the universe. "

This book is a brilliant historical account of Einstein's famous formula... but that's just it- it's not all about Einstein. Bodanis flits around from scientist to scientist, according to the roles they played in paving the way for the formula or developing it afterwards. The biographies for each scientist are enjoyable to read and sometimes even humorous. I was delighted to see that he researched enough to give credit where credit was due; women scientists (and sometimes even men who lacked the prestige or wealth) were sometimes denied the thanks for their achievements, but Bodanis ignores none.I learned more from this novel than I ever did from highschool (or college) courses, and it was a fun read.

We often talk about this equation without understanding the significance of it. The book really helps us to understand the inner connotation of one of the most imperative equation of mankind. David Bodanis drafted the pre-existent thought, birth, early stage, complete development and post effect of the equation wonderfully. The equation played a pivotal role during Second World War and it’s well documented inside. The vivid imagination and intellect of Einstein produced this era redefined equation. He took merely eight months to develop it without having a laboratory or any special equipment to carry forward his research. Amazing books with full of information on different discoveries of science (along with E=mc2) and life of scientist. Must Read."

Bodanis' writing isn't too weighty or heady for readers unversed in theoretical physics. He never leaves readers behind or talks over their heads. The ideas explored in the book cover everything from the birth of an idea to the expansion of the universe, and it doesn't stick exclusively to the title's subject. Bodanis covers the influence of the idea on subsequent generations of cosmologists and theorists, and he makes a strong case for something we already knew: Einstein and his famous equation changed the course of human civilization.NC"

I enjoyed it even more when I realized that there were additional notes at the end of the book - I highly recommend following up on them at the end of each chapter.Anyway, the book: I loved how Bodanis managed to make all the ""science stuff"" understandable and interesting without ever feeling like it was ""dumbed-down"" or patronizing. The best part is the Bodanis is a great storyteller. I felt bogged down a bit with all the names, but it was really interesting to realize how much politics, religion, romance, wars, and family relationships played into some of the most incredible discoveries of the 19th and 20th centuries.I recommend this book to readers of all ages and backgrounds, and will definitely be reading it again."

Emphasis on the word history here. While Bodanis does try to give the reader an intuition of the science (probably in ways that would make a real scientist cringe on occasion), it is not really his focus. The real focus is the story of the equation and the people involved in its history. While Bodanis does take some liberties speculating on the feelings and motivations of some of the participants, the book is full of interesting things that I did not know about the scientists. Also, by focusing on the equation, the reader gets to see a scientific history sliced in a unique and intriguing way. Altogether, a good fluffy science book."

I found the connection between religion and new scientific theories in the 18th century a shock, such as the connection of magnetism and electricity by the theory that they both emit circular pluses instead of linear one, the basis of this theory being that people are holy and they work to complete the ""circle"" through good deeds. This book is filled with scientific history and formulation that causing a greater understanding in basic ideas that people have been told to memorize, causing a slow read, but an interesting one. "

This makes the work an excellent introduction to these, and related topics, by focusing on the human side of the key players surrounding the development and application of this most famous, and simple of physics equations. There are a few spots here and there where his prose drifts into romanticizing this or that odd encounter. Sometimes this works, and sometimes this, quite frankly, fails spectacularly. But, these cringe-worthy episodes are spread out enough to make quite an enjoyable read, and Bodanis' prose certainly encourages one to look into the history of the more marginal figures in this historical drama."

This was my favorite kind of book (like Da Vinci Code/Angels and Demons), the kind that keeps me scribbling down names and topics that I want to explore further. It read like an action/adventure novel and left me searching for more on du Chatelet, Voltaire (of all people!), and Lavoisier.

My favorite part is the beginning, where he tells the history of the terms of the equation. How did 'c' come to stand for the speed of light, and what's the story of its derivation? Fascinating stuff. He also traces the history of the equation from its publication in 1905 through the development of the first A-bomb in the Manhattan Project, and the potential future of the universe--all based on the truths of e=mc2.

The complexity of the subject matter cannot be covered in such a short book, but it serves as a great study guide with all the annotations and extensive bibliography.

I've become more and more interested in learning about physics and how the world works, and this book plays into that perfectly. Bodanis breaks down what E=mC2 really MEANS perfectly. He has a gift for describing this really complex theories so the average man can understand them. Near the middle of the book, he breaks down the exact chemical reactions that take place during the detonation of a nuclear bomb as well as exactly how the Earth came to be as we know it today. It was really quite extraordinary to read. I would recommend this to anybody with an interest in Science. "

I love science, I love books about the history of science, and I love learning about the people who have a question and don't let it go until they figure it all out. I had no idea who Cecilia Payne was until I read this book. What does SHE have to do with Einstein's famous equation?

It's the anecdotes that make it an interesting read. The author marries his narrative of scientific progress with the last two centuries' pivotal events. This makes it not just a recounting of the triumph of science but also a chronicle of the role scientists have played in shaping history. The high point of this book is the part dealing with the development and the use of the atom bomb. Its fascinating as well as harrowing. That part more than makes up for the numerous duller tracts.

It is written in a true biography form, with the reader learning about the ancestry of this most famous formula. You hear about all the personalities that led up to this formula. There is some question of whether Einstein or his wife really came up with the formula.I liked the book. The middle was a bit too much biography about personalities and their traits that could have been left out or condensed. His writing of the atomic bomb as it floated down over Hiroshima was elegant and disturbing at the same time. Quite a trick in literature."

The clear and understandable descriptions of sometimes very complex science, combined with the fascinating stories of people along the way who've been part of the e=mc2 story, makes for an interesting and engaging read."

Broke down the theories and sciences in a fairly easy way to understand, and highlighted how Einstein's work was completed on the shoulders of many others who came before him, and was continued by those who followed. Whether you have a particular interest in science or not, this is a fascinating read. A tad dry in places, but the amazing connectivity in our world that Bodanis describes kept me at it."

Definitely worth a read for anyone interested in the fun facts and histories of the independent discoverers of each of the equation's symbols and understanding how they all relate and to really better understand how they affect our everyday life. No formal education in the sciences is required as the author does not assume you have any more than the most basic background in physics/math, and he writes the book in the simplest English."

It is the kind of writing one wishes there were more of, and that perhaps high school students should be reading so as to feel empowered, rather than being cowed or self selecting out (as I did) because of imaginary obstacles.

I could not set down the book till I finished reading it. I thought Einstein was an atheist but I realize that I was wrong. Gravity and light's interaction is still my most profound and awe inspiring fact of this universe as revealed by Einstein's theories.
79,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236601-popup-ch,3,"A very sprawling text, ostensibly about Einstein's famous equality, but in reality an excuse to investigate things as disparate as the history of the equal sign and the WWII raid on the heavy water facility in Rjukan.Surprisingly, the book only contains a scant biography of Einstein, and the bulk of the book describes in layman's terms the history of such concepts as Energy, Mass and the speed of light.

I've become more and more interested in learning about physics and how the world works, and this book plays into that perfectly. Bodanis breaks down what E=mC2 really MEANS perfectly. He has a gift for describing this really complex theories so the average man can understand them. Near the middle of the book, he breaks down the exact chemical reactions that take place during the detonation of a nuclear bomb as well as exactly how the Earth came to be as we know it today. It was really quite extraordinary to read. I would recommend this to anybody with an interest in Science. "

The book is an easy and fast paced read, for someone with very little background knowledge of relativity & modern physics, this could be a good introduction.

117,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23683322-pranjal-shah,5,It was one of the best books I have read till date. It is quite easy to understand with simple language. It is very rare to come across book a book that explains the famous equation in language simple enough for a 13 year old to understand.This is not a biography of Herr Albert Einstein but of his famous equation 'E=mc^2'. The book does not dwell into his personal life.It is a personal favourite and I find myself going back to it from time to time. It is truly a book worthy of the name.

It's an eclectic book, starting out with with the story of E, then a chapter on =, then m, c, ^2. He doesn't attempt to explain the math in any detail, but does a great job of telling the background story. The second half of the book gets into stories about Einstein and others who either interacted with him or carried on his work. Really engaging!"
120,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35753449-cooper-carpenter,4,"I thought this book was very enlightening, by the fact that the one was able to learn the history around some basic principles that are involved in the equation ""E=mc^2"" and how they have formulated. I found the connection between religion and new scientific theories in the 18th century a shock, such as the connection of magnetism and electricity by the theory that they both emit circular pluses instead of linear one, the basis of this theory being that people are holy and they work to complete the ""circle"" through good deeds. This book is filled with scientific history and formulation that causing a greater understanding in basic ideas that people have been told to memorize, causing a slow read, but an interesting one. "

This makes the work an excellent introduction to these, and related topics, by focusing on the human side of the key players surrounding the development and application of this most famous, and simple of physics equations. There are a few spots here and there where his prose drifts into romanticizing this or that odd encounter. Sometimes this works, and sometimes this, quite frankly, fails spectacularly. But, these cringe-worthy episodes are spread out enough to make quite an enjoyable read, and Bodanis' prose certainly encourages one to look into the history of the more marginal figures in this historical drama."

This is a fascinating romp through the people who made discoveries prior to Einstein that allowed him to come up with the Theory of Relativity. This was my favorite kind of book (like Da Vinci Code/Angels and Demons), the kind that keeps me scribbling down names and topics that I want to explore further. It read like an action/adventure novel and left me searching for more on du Chatelet, Voltaire (of all people!), and Lavoisier. Not being a biography reader, that this propelled me to biography is quite remarkable. He made it interesting to me and gave their lives a greater context. Bravo!"
123,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2671549-anastasia-hobbet,4,"A brilliant idea to write a biography of the equation. Bodanis' writing skills aren't brilliant, but they don't render the book unreadable, just awkward from time to time, verging on Clank! here and there. My favorite part is the beginning, where he tells the history of the terms of the equation. How did 'c' come to stand for the speed of light, and what's the story of its derivation? Fascinating stuff. He also traces the history of the equation from its publication in 1905 through the development of the first A-bomb in the Manhattan Project, and the potential future of the universe--all based on the truths of e=mc2.

124,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17401051-angelika,4,"A very engaging and hard to put down ride through the history of science, highlighting the people and their stories behind the names one might have heard of ...or - in the case of female scientists- had not. It is a great introduction to concepts and people around the formula. If you take it as that and not as an attempt to teach you the details relativity theory then it is a great read. The complexity of the subject matter cannot be covered in such a short book, but it serves as a great study guide with all the annotations and extensive bibliography. I came away wanting to read much more about everyone mentioned in that book. "

The book is full of interesting stories & characters, quite a few of them are not very well known but their contribution towards science has been immense. To name one - Lise Meitner. Look her up. The book is an easy and fast paced read, for someone with very little background knowledge of relativity & modern physics, this could be a good introduction. Others would find the stories interesting."
147,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23683322-pranjal-shah,5,It was one of the best books I have read till date. It is quite easy to understand with simple language. It is very rare to come across book a book that explains the famous equation in language simple enough for a 13 year old to understand.This is not a biography of Herr Albert Einstein but of his famous equation 'E=mc^2'. The book does not dwell into his personal life.It is a personal favourite and I find myself going back to it from time to time. It is truly a book worthy of the name.

I'm not mathematically minded, or scientifically savvy, parts of this book baffled me with technical stuff, but for the most part it was very engaging. There was lots of history, personal relationships, intrigue, and anxiety even though I knew how things turned out with the development of THE bomb.I liked learning about all of the scientists and the section on follow up was excellent. The book recommendations at the end were good. I've added a few to my to read list."

It's an eclectic book, starting out with with the story of E, then a chapter on =, then m, c, ^2. He doesn't attempt to explain the math in any detail, but does a great job of telling the background story. The second half of the book gets into stories about Einstein and others who either interacted with him or carried on his work. Really engaging!"
150,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35753449-cooper-carpenter,4,"I thought this book was very enlightening, by the fact that the one was able to learn the history around some basic principles that are involved in the equation ""E=mc^2"" and how they have formulated. I found the connection between religion and new scientific theories in the 18th century a shock, such as the connection of magnetism and electricity by the theory that they both emit circular pluses instead of linear one, the basis of this theory being that people are holy and they work to complete the ""circle"" through good deeds. This book is filled with scientific history and formulation that causing a greater understanding in basic ideas that people have been told to memorize, causing a slow read, but an interesting one. "

This makes the work an excellent introduction to these, and related topics, by focusing on the human side of the key players surrounding the development and application of this most famous, and simple of physics equations. There are a few spots here and there where his prose drifts into romanticizing this or that odd encounter. Sometimes this works, and sometimes this, quite frankly, fails spectacularly. But, these cringe-worthy episodes are spread out enough to make quite an enjoyable read, and Bodanis' prose certainly encourages one to look into the history of the more marginal figures in this historical drama."

This is a fascinating romp through the people who made discoveries prior to Einstein that allowed him to come up with the Theory of Relativity. This was my favorite kind of book (like Da Vinci Code/Angels and Demons), the kind that keeps me scribbling down names and topics that I want to explore further. It read like an action/adventure novel and left me searching for more on du Chatelet, Voltaire (of all people!), and Lavoisier. Not being a biography reader, that this propelled me to biography is quite remarkable. He made it interesting to me and gave their lives a greater context. Bravo!"

Bodanis' writing skills aren't brilliant, but they don't render the book unreadable, just awkward from time to time, verging on Clank! here and there. My favorite part is the beginning, where he tells the history of the terms of the equation. How did 'c' come to stand for the speed of light, and what's the story of its derivation? Fascinating stuff. He also traces the history of the equation from its publication in 1905 through the development of the first A-bomb in the Manhattan Project, and the potential future of the universe--all based on the truths of e=mc2.

It is a great introduction to concepts and people around the formula. If you take it as that and not as an attempt to teach you the details relativity theory then it is a great read. The complexity of the subject matter cannot be covered in such a short book, but it serves as a great study guide with all the annotations and extensive bibliography. I came away wanting to read much more about everyone mentioned in that book. "

I've become more and more interested in learning about physics and how the world works, and this book plays into that perfectly. Bodanis breaks down what E=mC2 really MEANS perfectly. He has a gift for describing this really complex theories so the average man can understand them. Near the middle of the book, he breaks down the exact chemical reactions that take place during the detonation of a nuclear bomb as well as exactly how the Earth came to be as we know it today.

It's the anecdotes that make it an interesting read. The author marries his narrative of scientific progress with the last two centuries' pivotal events. This makes it not just a recounting of the triumph of science but also a chronicle of the role scientists have played in shaping history. The high point of this book is the part dealing with the development and the use of the atom bomb. Its fascinating as well as harrowing. That part more than makes up for the numerous duller tracts.

I came away from this book with the message that e=mc2 is a fundamentally important equation with applications across so many different areas and pretty much all of us can and should understand what it's about. The clear and understandable descriptions of sometimes very complex science, combined with the fascinating stories of people along the way who've been part of the e=mc2 story, makes for an interesting and engaging read."

Broke down the theories and sciences in a fairly easy way to understand, and highlighted how Einstein's work was completed on the shoulders of many others who came before him, and was continued by those who followed. Whether you have a particular interest in science or not, this is a fascinating read. A tad dry in places, but the amazing connectivity in our world that Bodanis describes kept me at it."

While you would think that this concept would be rather dry and unexciting, David Bodanis using the rich tapestry (sorry couldn't help myself) of people's lives to tell the story. Thus it is more about people than a physics lecture. A wonderful approach to learning. Very enjoyable."
165,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1828267-peter,5,"This is the book you have always wanted to read. It explains in terms we can all understand why and how Einstein changed the understanding of the universe when he conjectured that E=MC2...we need to know this so that we can understand why The Big Bang Theory is a cultural phenom and why when for a moment Cern suggested that a particle might travel faster than the speed of light the whole world freaked out. Bodanis is a great communicator, a great story teller and the kind of thinker you wanted in high school physics. "
166,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5418556-sabah,5,"Awesome book; never thought a book about Einstein's most famous equation, e=mc^2, could be so riveting. Definitely worth a read for anyone interested in the fun facts and histories of the independent discoverers of each of the equation's symbols and understanding how they all relate and to really better understand how they affect our everyday life. No formal education in the sciences is required as the author does not assume you have any more than the most basic background in physics/math, and he writes the book in the simplest English."
167,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/353546-anna,4,"Liked it very much-- fascinating work of history of science that is organized in a reader friendly way. The kind of book anyone interested in science would find helpful as it explains these concepts that some of us assume are beyond us in clear and grounded ways that allow you to enter and understand that world. It is the kind of writing one wishes there were more of, and that perhaps high school students should be reading so as to feel empowered, rather than being cowed or self selecting out (as I did) because of imaginary obstacles. "
168,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57974520-ray,5,Excellent non technical review of the impact of the most famous equation of the last century. I have myself wondered at it simplicity and beauty and tried understand it and all it importance. This book brings out the impact of this profound in a very beautiful historical story telling manner. I could not set down the book till I finished reading it. I thought Einstein was an atheist but I realize that I was wrong. Gravity and light's interaction is still my most profound and awe inspiring fact of this universe as revealed by Einstein's theories.
169,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236601-popup-ch,3,"A very sprawling text, ostensibly about Einstein's famous equality, but in reality an excuse to investigate things as disparate as the history of the equal sign and the WWII raid on the heavy water facility in Rjukan.Surprisingly, the book only contains a scant biography of Einstein, and the bulk of the book describes in layman's terms the history of such concepts as Energy, Mass and the speed of light. (There's no mention of the deeper mysteries of mass - the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass, nor even a cameo appearence of the Higgs boson.)"
170,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/240385-allison,4,"A fascinating read for anyone who wants to learn about the equation - it's history, meaning, and implications in our world. The history's of the scientists involved are brief, but enlightening. It might help to have a bit of background knowledge about the history of the atom to more fully grasp the complexities of a lot of the scientific work discussed. Overall, I felt this book was well written enough that any non-science person could get through it without struggle and with interest. "
171,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142205-sam,4,"This is a fast overview of many of the facets involved with this famous equation. The author offer historical perspectives on the major discoveries that led to the development of this theory. He also provides some science, cultural grounding, and personal backstory for the major players. What's most interesting, though, is that the book is not written as an academic, intellectual history. Rather, it reads at times like popular fiction writing. It is unusual and fascinating."
172,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537451-aimee,4,"I really liked this book. The author takes a different approach to explaining this famous equation. He looks at the history and many of the scientists who contributed to its birth as well as explaining in simple terms why it's such a big deal. Reading through, I found many familiar names and many not so familiar. It's very readable - he was shooting for a mass audience - but still technical enough to keep your interest. "
173,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,4,"This book really gives you a feel for the simple but elegant equation. We often hear it, but few take the time to really understand it. It is astounding to me that Einstein was able to think his way toward it without experiments to guide himself along the way. The book chronicles the ""giants' sshoulders"" on which Einstein stood, but it was an incredible leap forward none the less. Further, this book helps you to understand the everyday meaning of E=mc^2."

Thus it is more about people than a physics lecture. A wonderful approach to learning. Very enjoyable."
195,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1828267-peter,5,"This is the book you have always wanted to read. It explains in terms we can all understand why and how Einstein changed the understanding of the universe when he conjectured that E=MC2...we need to know this so that we can understand why The Big Bang Theory is a cultural phenom and why when for a moment Cern suggested that a particle might travel faster than the speed of light the whole world freaked out.

Definitely worth a read for anyone interested in the fun facts and histories of the independent discoverers of each of the equation's symbols and understanding how they all relate and to really better understand how they affect our everyday life. No formal education in the sciences is required as the author does not assume you have any more than the most basic background in physics/math, and he writes the book in the simplest English."
197,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/353546-anna,4,"Liked it very much-- fascinating work of history of science that is organized in a reader friendly way. The kind of book anyone interested in science would find helpful as it explains these concepts that some of us assume are beyond us in clear and grounded ways that allow you to enter and understand that world. It is the kind of writing one wishes there were more of, and that perhaps high school students should be reading so as to feel empowered, rather than being cowed or self selecting out (as I did) because of imaginary obstacles.

I could not set down the book till I finished reading it. I thought Einstein was an atheist but I realize that I was wrong. Gravity and light's interaction is still my most profound and awe inspiring fact of this universe as revealed by Einstein's theories.

This makes the work an excellent introduction to these, and related topics, by focusing on the human side of the key players surrounding the development and application of this most famous, and simple of physics equations. There are a few spots here and there where his prose drifts into romanticizing this or that odd encounter. Sometimes this works, and sometimes this, quite frankly, fails spectacularly. But, these cringe-worthy episodes are spread out enough to make quite an enjoyable read, and Bodanis' prose certainly encourages one to look into the history of the more marginal figures in this historical drama."

This was my favorite kind of book (like Da Vinci Code/Angels and Demons), the kind that keeps me scribbling down names and topics that I want to explore further. It read like an action/adventure novel and left me searching for more on du Chatelet, Voltaire (of all people!), and Lavoisier. Not being a biography reader, that this propelled me to biography is quite remarkable. He made it interesting to me and gave their lives a greater context. Bravo!"

Bodanis' writing skills aren't brilliant, but they don't render the book unreadable, just awkward from time to time, verging on Clank! here and there. My favorite part is the beginning, where he tells the history of the terms of the equation. How did 'c' come to stand for the speed of light, and what's the story of its derivation? Fascinating stuff. He also traces the history of the equation from its publication in 1905 through the development of the first A-bomb in the Manhattan Project, and the potential future of the universe--all based on the truths of e=mc2.

214,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17401051-angelika,4,"A very engaging and hard to put down ride through the history of science, highlighting the people and their stories behind the names one might have heard of ...or - in the case of female scientists- had not. It is a great introduction to concepts and people around the formula. If you take it as that and not as an attempt to teach you the details relativity theory then it is a great read. The complexity of the subject matter cannot be covered in such a short book, but it serves as a great study guide with all the annotations and extensive bibliography. I came away wanting to read much more about everyone mentioned in that book. "
215,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266826-lisa,4,"Starting with each of the letters and symbols in the famous equation, the author tracks down the origin of each. Having explained those, he then charts the path of the individuals and breakthroughs that led to the the first atomic bombs. While that latter part is a little hard to read, knowing the tragedy and death that will follow the development of the bomb, overall this is an enjoyable and informative read. It provided the clearest explanation of the atomic chain reaction that creates the mushroom cloud I've ever read. It's so good, I had to share it with others. ""Hey, do you know..."" Completely worth your time."

This book is one part fun, two parts science, and three parts history. The author takes a very unique approach by dissecting the equation to its fundamental parts (incl. notation) and constructs a biography of its genesis through exploring the innovators responsible for each breakthrough that enabled the breakthrough by Einstein: E=mc^2My favorite chapters were the last two, which (rather quickly) bring past to present and then paint the highlights of the equation's future.I still need to read the extensive notes section. Looking forward to some engaging rhetoric around that topic."
217,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48399868-zach,5,"One of my favorite books of all time. I've become more and more interested in learning about physics and how the world works, and this book plays into that perfectly. Bodanis breaks down what E=mC2 really MEANS perfectly. He has a gift for describing this really complex theories so the average man can understand them. Near the middle of the book, he breaks down the exact chemical reactions that take place during the detonation of a nuclear bomb as well as exactly how the Earth came to be as we know it today. It was really quite extraordinary to read. I would recommend this to anybody with an interest in Science. "

Then one day I thought ""OK it's time to read about the world's most famous equation."" It took me a while to finally finish it because I enjoyed it so much that I read it twice. I love science, I love books about the history of science, and I love learning about the people who have a question and don't let it go until they figure it all out. I had no idea who Cecilia Payne was until I read this book. What does SHE have to do with Einstein's famous equation? Read this book and you will come to appreciate her and many others who help us understand the wonders of our universe."
219,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22444778-sharang-limaye,3,A lot of this book is not easy to follow despite the obvious efforts Bodanis has put in to make it more accessible to the lay reader. It's the anecdotes that make it an interesting read. The author marries his narrative of scientific progress with the last two centuries' pivotal events. This makes it not just a recounting of the triumph of science but also a chronicle of the role scientists have played in shaping history. The high point of this book is the part dealing with the development and the use of the atom bomb. Its fascinating as well as harrowing. That part more than makes up for the numerous duller tracts.
220,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/594992-paul,3,"This book has a lot of AHA moments. It is written in a true biography form, with the reader learning about the ancestry of this most famous formula. You hear about all the personalities that led up to this formula. There is some question of whether Einstein or his wife really came up with the formula.I liked the book. The middle was a bit too much biography about personalities and their traits that could have been left out or condensed. His writing of the atomic bomb as it floated down over Hiroshima was elegant and disturbing at the same time. Quite a trick in literature."
221,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157792-ryan,4,"this book is a whole lot of fun. bodanis spreads his arms real wide and grabs a huge of load of knowledge-forming information, packs it all together like neutrons and protons, forms it into a nice little ball and hands it to you on a thin, ceramic plate that had last been used to feed sloppy joes to a ten year old glued to the public broadcasting system. a millisecond-by-millisecond narrative of the hiroshima bomb's innards as it fell was the most thrilling ten minutes of reading i've had in a while.

I came away from this book with the message that e=mc2 is a fundamentally important equation with applications across so many different areas and pretty much all of us can and should understand what it's about. The clear and understandable descriptions of sometimes very complex science, combined with the fascinating stories of people along the way who've been part of the e=mc2 story, makes for an interesting and engaging read."
223,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4725598-kate,4,"What struck me about this book was that it allowed me to understand the science behind, and the evolution of Einstein's E=mc2 equation. Broke down the theories and sciences in a fairly easy way to understand, and highlighted how Einstein's work was completed on the shoulders of many others who came before him, and was continued by those who followed. Whether you have a particular interest in science or not, this is a fascinating read. A tad dry in places, but the amazing connectivity in our world that Bodanis describes kept me at it."

I've become more and more interested in learning about physics and how the world works, and this book plays into that perfectly. Bodanis breaks down what E=mC2 really MEANS perfectly. He has a gift for describing this really complex theories so the average man can understand them. Near the middle of the book, he breaks down the exact chemical reactions that take place during the detonation of a nuclear bomb as well as exactly how the Earth came to be as we know it today. It was really quite extraordinary to read. I would recommend this to anybody with an interest in Science. "

266,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4248590-rudrangshu-das,4,"This book is more about the history of the science around E=mc^2 than the science itself. The book is full of interesting stories & characters, quite a few of them are not very well known but their contribution towards science has been immense. To name one - Lise Meitner. Look her up. The book is an easy and fast paced read, for someone with very little background knowledge of relativity & modern physics, this could be a good introduction. Others would find the stories interesting."
267,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23683322-pranjal-shah,5,It was one of the best books I have read till date. It is quite easy to understand with simple language. It is very rare to come across book a book that explains the famous equation in language simple enough for a 13 year old to understand.This is not a biography of Herr Albert Einstein but of his famous equation 'E=mc^2'. The book does not dwell into his personal life.It is a personal favourite and I find myself going back to it from time to time. It is truly a book worthy of the name.
268,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32243-mim,4,"I loved this book! I'm not mathematically minded, or scientifically savvy, parts of this book baffled me with technical stuff, but for the most part it was very engaging.

It's an eclectic book, starting out with with the story of E, then a chapter on =, then m, c, ^2. He doesn't attempt to explain the math in any detail, but does a great job of telling the background story. The second half of the book gets into stories about Einstein and others who either interacted with him or carried on his work. Really engaging!"
270,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35753449-cooper-carpenter,4,"I thought this book was very enlightening, by the fact that the one was able to learn the history around some basic principles that are involved in the equation ""E=mc^2"" and how they have formulated. I found the connection between religion and new scientific theories in the 18th century a shock, such as the connection of magnetism and electricity by the theory that they both emit circular pluses instead of linear one, the basis of this theory being that people are holy and they work to complete the ""circle"" through good deeds. This book is filled with scientific history and formulation that causing a greater understanding in basic ideas that people have been told to memorize, causing a slow read, but an interesting one. "
271,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051217-justin,4,"Unlike most books on this sort of thing, Bodanis does an excellent job of hiding how much research he's actually done. This makes the work an excellent introduction to these, and related topics, by focusing on the human side of the key players surrounding the development and application of this most famous, and simple of physics equations. There are a few spots here and there where his prose drifts into romanticizing this or that odd encounter. Sometimes this works, and sometimes this, quite frankly, fails spectacularly. But, these cringe-worthy episodes are spread out enough to make quite an enjoyable read, and Bodanis' prose certainly encourages one to look into the history of the more marginal figures in this historical drama."
272,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/316640-lisa,5,"Not at all what I expected, it was even better than I hoped. This is a fascinating romp through the people who made discoveries prior to Einstein that allowed him to come up with the Theory of Relativity. This was my favorite kind of book (like Da Vinci Code/Angels and Demons), the kind that keeps me scribbling down names and topics that I want to explore further. It read like an action/adventure novel and left me searching for more on du Chatelet, Voltaire (of all people!), and Lavoisier. Not being a biography reader, that this propelled me to biography is quite remarkable. He made it interesting to me and gave their lives a greater context. Bravo!"
273,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2671549-anastasia-hobbet,4,"A brilliant idea to write a biography of the equation. Bodanis' writing skills aren't brilliant, but they don't render the book unreadable, just awkward from time to time, verging on Clank! here and there. My favorite part is the beginning, where he tells the history of the terms of the equation. How did 'c' come to stand for the speed of light, and what's the story of its derivation? Fascinating stuff. He also traces the history of the equation from its publication in 1905 through the development of the first A-bomb in the Manhattan Project, and the potential future of the universe--all based on the truths of e=mc2.

His style is easily accessible and while I was burning through this book; occasionally I had the impression that I was reading a Michael Shermer work. This biography of ""the World's Most Famous Equation"" is strongly recommended by me. I plan on going by the library later today to see what other Bodanis book I can find!"

The book is full of interesting stories & characters, quite a few of them are not very well known but their contribution towards science has been immense. To name one - Lise Meitner. Look her up. The book is an easy and fast paced read, for someone with very little background knowledge of relativity & modern physics, this could be a good introduction. Others would find the stories interesting."
297,0425181642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23683322-pranjal-shah,5,It was one of the best books I have read till date. It is quite easy to understand with simple language. It is very rare to come across book a book that explains the famous equation in language simple enough for a 13 year old to understand.This is not a biography of Herr Albert Einstein but of his famous equation 'E=mc^2'. The book does not dwell into his personal life.It is a personal favourite and I find myself going back to it from time to time. It is truly a book worthy of the name.

I'm not mathematically minded, or scientifically savvy, parts of this book baffled me with technical stuff, but for the most part it was very engaging. There was lots of history, personal relationships, intrigue, and anxiety even though I knew how things turned out with the development of THE bomb.I liked learning about all of the scientists and the section on follow up was excellent. The book recommendations at the end were good. I've added a few to my to read list."

It's an eclectic book, starting out with with the story of E, then a chapter on =, then m, c, ^2. He doesn't attempt to explain the math in any detail, but does a great job of telling the background story. The second half of the book gets into stories about Einstein and others who either interacted with him or carried on his work. Really engaging!"
